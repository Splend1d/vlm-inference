            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of half-life and how it applies to radioactive decay.\n\n1. **Understanding Half-Life**: The half-life of a radioactive material is the time it takes for half of the radioactive atoms in a sample to decay. This is a constant for a given substance and is independent of the initial amount of the substance.\n\n2. **Initial Amount**: We start with 10.00 grams of the radioactive material.\n\n3. **Time Calculation**: We need to find out how many half-lives occur in 2 hours.\n\n   - **Convert Hours to Minutes**: Since the half-life is given in minutes, we need to convert 2 hours into minutes.\n     \\[\n     2 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \\text{ minutes}\n     \\]\n\n   - **Calculate Number of Half-Life Cycles**: Divide the total time by the half-life.\n     \\[\n     \\frac{120 \\text{ minutes}}{36 \\text{ minutes/half-life}} = 3.33 \\text{ half-life cycles}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Applying Half-Life**: Since each half-life reduces the amount of material by half, we apply this to the initial amount.\n\n   - **Calculate Remaining Amount**: Start with 10.00 grams and apply the half-life three times.\n     \\[\n     10.00 \\text{ grams} \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3 = 10.00 \\text{ grams} \\times \\frac{1}{8} = 1.25 \\text{ grams}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Final Answer**: After 2 hours, 1.25 grams of the radioactive material will remain.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 3.33 grams",
