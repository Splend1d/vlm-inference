            "content": "To understand how the Tay-Sachs allele is preserved in the population, we need to consider the principles of genetics and natural selection.\n\nA. Heterozygous individuals will show no symptoms.\n- This option is incorrect. While heterozygous individuals do not exhibit symptoms of Tay-Sachs disease, they are carriers of the recessive allele. They can pass the allele to their offspring, contributing to the gene pool.\n\nB. Spontaneous mutation converts the dominant allele to the recessive form.\n- This option is incorrect. Spontaneous mutations are rare and typically do not convert a dominant allele to a recessive form. Moreover, the mutation would not be beneficial for the individual, as it would lead to the disease.\n\nC. Occasionally the gene will instead increase the fitness of the individual.\n- This option is incorrect. The Tay-Sachs allele is recessive and does not confer any advantage to the individual. It is not beneficial for the individual's fitness, and thus, it is not likely to be selected for in a population.\n\nD. Tay-Sachs is asymptomatic in people who are homozygous recessive.\n- This option is correct. Individuals who are homozygous recessive for the Tay-Sachs allele do not exhibit symptoms of the disease. They are carriers and can pass the allele to their offspring. Since they do not show symptoms, they can survive and reproduce, thus preserving the allele in the population.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Tay-Sachs is asymptomatic in people who are homozygous recessive.",
