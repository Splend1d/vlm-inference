In this case, the ACLU, NAWL, and AFL-CIO came together to oppose Alito's nomination, demonstrating their shared concern about his potential impact on civil liberties, women's rights, and labor rights.\n\nA. realignment: This refers to a significant shift in the political landscape, often involving changes in party affiliation or the emergence of new political movements. The opposition to Alito's nomination does not represent a realignment.\n\nB. coalition building: This is the correct answer. The ACLU, NAWL, and AFL-CIO worked together to oppose Alito's nomination, demonstrating their shared goals and interests.\n\nC. impeachment: Impeachment is the process of removing a government official from office, typically through a vote in the House of Representatives and a trial in the Senate. The opposition to Alito's nomination is not related to impeachment.\n\nD. a recall election: A recall election is a process by which voters can remove a government official from office before the end of their term. The opposition to Alito's nomination is not related to a recall election.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. coalition building.",
