            "content": "To determine when maximal dynamic exercise becomes predominantly aerobic, we need to understand the transition between aerobic and anaerobic energy systems.\n\n1. **Anaerobic Energy System**: This system is used for short bursts of high-intensity activity, typically lasting less than 10 seconds. It relies on the rapid breakdown of glucose to produce energy without oxygen.\n\n2. **Aerobic Energy System**: This system is used for longer periods of moderate to high-intensity activity. It relies on the oxidation of fats and carbohydrates in the presence of oxygen, which allows for sustained energy production.\n\n3. **Transition Point**: Maximal dynamic exercise, which involves rapid, powerful movements, is initially anaerobic. However, as the exercise continues, the body begins to rely more on the aerobic system to sustain the activity.\n\n4. **Maximal Aerobic Capacity**: This is the point at which the body can sustain maximal aerobic activity. It is typically reached after about 4 minutes of exercise.\n\nGiven this understanding, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 4 minutes\n\nThis is the point at which maximal dynamic exercise becomes predominantly aerobic, as the body has adapted to using oxygen for energy production over the initial anaerobic phase.",
