It is considered a passive element because it does not consume any power; it only supplies power to the circuit.\n\n2. **Current Source**: A current source is a component that provides a constant current through its terminals. Like a voltage source, it is also considered a passive element because it does not consume any power; it only supplies power to the circuit.\n\n3. **Active Elements**: Active elements are components that can both supply and consume power. They are responsible for amplifying signals or controlling the flow of current in a circuit. Examples of active elements include transistors, operational amplifiers, and diodes.\n\nGiven this information, let's analyze each option:\n\n- **Option A: Voltage Source** - This is a passive element because it only supplies power without consuming any.\n- **Option B: Current Source** - This is also a passive element because it only supplies power without consuming any.\n- **Option C: Both** - Since both voltage and current sources are passive elements, this option is incorrect.\n- **Option D: None of these** - This option is incorrect because both voltage and current sources are passive elements.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. None of these.",
