            "content": "To determine how much greater the intensity of a sound at 80 decibels is compared to a sound at 60 decibels, we need to understand the relationship between intensity and decibels.\n\nThe intensity of a sound is measured in decibels (dB) and is related to the power of the sound source. The formula to calculate the intensity of a sound is:\n\n\\[ I = 10 \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{I_0}{I} \\right) \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( I \\) is the intensity of the sound,\n- \\( I_0 \\) is the reference intensity (usually \\( 10^{-12} \\) watts per square meter for human hearing),\n- \\( I \\) is the intensity of the sound we are measuring.\n\nGiven that the reference intensity \\( I_0 \\) is \\( 10^{-12} \\) watts per square meter, we can rewrite the formula as:\n\n\\[ I = 10 \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{10^{-12}}{I} \\right) \\]\n\nSimplifying this, we get:\n\n\\[ I = 10 \\log_{10} (10^{-12}) - 10 \\log_{10} (I) \\]\n\\[ I = 10(-12) - 10 \\log_{10} (I) \\]\n\\[ I = -120 - 10 \\log_{10} (I) \\]\n\nThis equation shows that the intensity \\( I \\) is inversely proportional to the logarithm of the intensity \\( I \\). This means that if the intensity doubles, the logarithm of the intensity will decrease by 10, and if the intensity increases by a factor of 10, the logarithm of the intensity will decrease by 10.\n\nNow, let's calculate the intensity ratio for a sound at 60 decibels and a sound at 80 decibels:\n\n1. **Convert decibels to intensity ratio:**\n   - For 60 dB:\n     \\[ I_60 = 10^{-12} \\times 10^{-12} = 10^{-24} \\]\n   - For 80 dB:\n     \\[ I_80 = 10^{-12} \\times 10^{-12} = 10^{-24} \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the ratio of intensities:**\n   \\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{I_80}{I_60} = \\frac{10^{-24}}{10^{-24}} = 1 \\]\n\nThis means that the intensity of a sound at 80 decibels is the same as the intensity of a sound at 60 decibels. Therefore, the intensity of a sound at 80 decibels is not greater than the intensity of a sound at 60 decibels.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 10 times greater\n\nThe correct answer is: A",
