            "content": "To determine which statement is true, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Increasing the protein intake above 3 grams per kg body mass per day will stimulate muscle growth and increase strength.\n- While protein is essential for muscle growth and repair, the amount of protein needed for muscle growth is typically around 1.6 to 2.2 grams per kg of body weight per day. Consuming more than 3 grams per kg per day is not necessary and may not lead to additional muscle growth. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nB. Creatine supplements can increase muscle strength and power.\n- Creatine is a naturally occurring substance found in muscle tissue that helps supply energy for short, high-intensity activities. It can increase muscle strength and power by enhancing the body's ability to produce energy during intense exercise. This statement is true.\n\nC. Amino acid supplements can increase muscle strength and power.\n- Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins, and while they are essential for muscle growth and repair, they do not directly increase muscle strength and power. Instead, they provide the necessary building blocks for muscle synthesis. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nD. Muscle damage is induced by shortening contractions.\n- Muscle damage is typically caused by eccentric contractions, which involve lengthening the muscle fibers during the contraction. This can lead to micro-tears in the muscle fibers, causing muscle damage. Shortening contractions do not typically cause muscle damage. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Creatine supplements can increase muscle strength and power.",
