            "content": "To determine which statement is always true of a spontaneous process, we need to understand the concept of spontaneity in thermodynamics. A spontaneous process is one that occurs naturally without the need for external energy input. This is often associated with an increase in entropy, which is a measure of disorder or randomness in a system.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. The process is exothermic.\n- An exothermic process releases energy to the surroundings, often in the form of heat. While many spontaneous processes are exothermic, not all spontaneous processes are exothermic. For example, a chemical reaction that absorbs heat can still be spontaneous. Therefore, this statement is not always true.\n\nB. The process does not involve any work.\n- A process that involves no work is one where the system's energy remains constant, and no energy is transferred to or from the surroundings. While some spontaneous processes may involve no work, others may involve work. For instance, a phase transition like melting or vaporization can involve work. Thus, this statement is not always true.\n\nC. The entropy of the system increases.\n- An increase in entropy is a hallmark of spontaneous processes. Entropy is a measure of the disorder or randomness in a system. In a spontaneous process, the system tends to move towards a state of higher disorder, which is why this statement is always true.\n\nD. The total entropy of the system plus surroundings increases.\n- This statement aligns with the second law of thermodynamics, which states that the total entropy of an isolated system and its surroundings always increases over time. This is a fundamental principle of spontaneous processes. Therefore, this statement is always true.\n\nConsidering the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nD. The total entropy of the system plus surroundings increases.",
