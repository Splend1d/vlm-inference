            "content": "To determine which statement is true about haematemesis, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. A low blood pressure (<90mmHg systolic) and a tachycardia (>100/min) are worrying features.\n- Haematemesis, or vomiting blood, can be a serious condition. Low blood pressure and tachycardia are concerning signs because they indicate a potential loss of blood volume and cardiac stress, respectively. These symptoms suggest that the patient may be experiencing significant blood loss or shock, which requires immediate medical attention.\n\nB. A pulse rate of 80/min in a patient taking Bisoprolol is reassuring.\n- Bisoprolol is a beta-blocker used to manage high blood pressure and heart rate. A pulse rate of 80/min is within the normal range for a resting heart rate, but it does not necessarily indicate that the patient is not experiencing haematemesis. The presence of haematemesis is a more critical factor to consider.\n\nC. Abdominal pain is always present.\n- While abdominal pain can be a symptom of haematemesis, it is not always present. Some patients may experience haematemesis without abdominal pain, or the pain may be mild and not immediately noticeable.\n\nD. An alcohol history is not essential.\n- An alcohol history can be relevant in some cases of haematemesis, as excessive alcohol consumption can contribute to gastrointestinal bleeding. However, it is not essential for diagnosing haematemesis.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the statement that is true about haematemesis is:\n\nA. A low blood pressure (<90mmHg systolic) and a tachycardia (>100/min) are worrying features.",
