            "content": "To determine which factor would have been required for the successful eradication of insect pests using DDT, we need to consider the principles of pest management and the role of DDT in this context.\n\nDDT was initially hailed as a wonder chemical due to its ability to kill a wide range of insects. However, over time, it became apparent that DDT was not as effective as initially thought, particularly against certain insect species. This was due to the development of resistance in some insect populations.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Larger doses of DDT should have been applied.\n- Applying larger doses of DDT would not necessarily address the issue of resistance. In fact, it could exacerbate the problem by increasing the likelihood of resistance developing in the target insect population.\n\nB. All habitats should have received applications of DDT at about the same time.\n- Applying DDT uniformly across all habitats would not prevent resistance. In fact, it could lead to the selection of resistant individuals in areas where DDT was applied more frequently.\n\nC. The frequency of DDT application should have been higher.\n- Increasing the frequency of DDT application would not solve the problem of resistance. It could potentially lead to more rapid development of resistance in the insect population.\n\nD. None of the individual insects should have possessed genomes that made them resistant to DDT.\n- This option is the most logical. For DDT to be effective in eradicating insect pests, it is crucial that the target insects do not develop resistance. If any individual insects possess genomes that make them resistant to DDT, the chemical will lose its effectiveness over time.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. None of the individual insects should have possessed genomes that made them resistant to DDT. This ensures that the chemical remains effective in controlling the pest population over the long term.",
