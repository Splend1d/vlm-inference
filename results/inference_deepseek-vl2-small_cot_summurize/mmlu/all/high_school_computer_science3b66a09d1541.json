The program can also be expressed as binary code, but will be more easily understood by humans when expressed in a higher-level programming language.\n\nExplanation:\nA program written in a high-level programming language is typically compiled or interpreted into machine code, which is binary code. This binary code can be directly executed by the computer's processor. However, high-level languages are designed to be more human-readable and easier to understand, which can make the program more maintainable and debuggable. Therefore, the program can be expressed as binary code, but it is often more understandable when written in a higher-level language.",
