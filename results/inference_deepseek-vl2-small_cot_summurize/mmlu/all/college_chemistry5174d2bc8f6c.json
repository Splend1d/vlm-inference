            "content": "To determine which statement is correct, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **all molecular bonds absorb IR radiation**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. Not all molecular bonds absorb IR radiation. Only bonds that are polar or have a change in dipole moment during vibration will absorb IR radiation. For example, C-H bonds in alkanes do not absorb IR radiation because they are nonpolar.\n\nB. **IR peak intensities are related to molecular mass**\n\nThis statement is also incorrect. The intensity of an IR peak is related to the number of molecules in the sample and the strength of the bond, not the molecular mass. For instance, a strong peak for a C-H bond in a large molecule like a fatty acid will be more intense than a weak peak for a C-H bond in a small molecule like ethanol.\n\nC. **most organic functional groups absorb in a characteristic region of the IR spectrum**\n\nThis statement is correct. Different functional groups in organic molecules absorb IR radiation at specific frequencies, known as characteristic absorption bands. For example, the C-H stretching vibration of alkanes typically appears in the 3000-3050 cm\u207b\u00b9 region, while the C=O stretching vibration of carbonyl compounds appears in the 1700-1750 cm\u207b\u00b9 region.\n\nD. **each element absorbs at a characteristic wavelength**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. While each element has a characteristic absorption spectrum, it is not limited to a single wavelength. The absorption of IR radiation by an element depends on the specific functional group present in the molecule. For example, the C-H stretching vibration of alkanes is a characteristic absorption for carbon, but it appears at different wavelengths depending on the specific alkane.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Most organic functional groups absorb in a characteristic region of the IR spectrum.",
