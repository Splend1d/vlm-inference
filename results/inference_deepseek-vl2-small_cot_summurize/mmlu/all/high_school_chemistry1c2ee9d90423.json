In this case, the reaction between NH4Br and AgNO3 is:\n\nNH4Br(aq) + AgNO3(aq) \u2192 NH4NO3(aq) + AgBr(s)\n\nThis equation shows that NH4+ and Br- are the actual species that are involved in the reaction, and they form NH4NO3 and AgBr.\n\nThe other options are not the net ionic equation because they either show the formation of a precipitate (AgBr) or the formation of a complex ion (Ag(NH4)3+), which is not the actual species that are involved in the reaction.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. NH4Br(aq) + NO3-(aq) \u2192 NH4NO3(aq) + Br-(aq)\n\nThis is the net ionic equation expected when solutions of NH4Br and AgNO3 are mixed together.\n\nThe final answer is: D",
