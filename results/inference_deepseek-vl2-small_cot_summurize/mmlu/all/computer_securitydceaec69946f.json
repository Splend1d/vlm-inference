Condentiality.\n\nExplanation:\n- **Condentiality** refers to the expectation that the information shared between the sender and the receiver will remain confidential and not be disclosed to unauthorized parties. This is a fundamental principle in secure communication, ensuring that sensitive information is protected.\n\n- **Integrity** (Option A) refers to the assurance that the information has not been altered or tampered with during transmission.\n\n- **Authentication** (Option C) refers to the verification of the identity of the sender and the receiver to ensure that the communication is indeed from the intended parties.\n\n- **Nonrepudiation** (Option D) refers to the assurance that the sender cannot deny having sent the message, which is often achieved through digital signatures.\n\nTherefore, the context of the question is about the confidentiality of the communication, making \"Condentiality\" the correct answer.",
