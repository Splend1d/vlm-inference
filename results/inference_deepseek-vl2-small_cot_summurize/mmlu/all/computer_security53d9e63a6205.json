A piece of software that intercepts and possibly modifies requests (and responses) between a web browser and web server.\n- This option describes a web proxy accurately. A web proxy acts as an intermediary between a user's web browser and the web server. It can intercept requests and responses, allowing for modifications such as caching, filtering, or logging. This is a common use case for web proxies, especially in corporate environments where security and monitoring are important.\n\nB. An agent that makes decisions on the client's behalf when interacting with web applications.\n- This option is not accurate for a web proxy. While a proxy can make decisions, it does so on behalf of the user, not the client. The client is the user's web browser, and the proxy acts as an intermediary.\n\nC. A piece of software that makes a web application look like a standalone application, making it easier to test.\n- This option describes a tool for testing web applications, not a web proxy. A web proxy is not designed to make web applications appear as standalone applications; rather, it is used for security and monitoring purposes.\n\nD. A simulator for the web, for use when off-line.\n- This option is incorrect. A web proxy is not a simulator for the web. It is a tool that operates in real-time, intercepting and modifying web traffic.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the correct answer is:\n\nA. A piece of software that intercepts and possibly modifies requests (and responses) between a web browser and web server.",
