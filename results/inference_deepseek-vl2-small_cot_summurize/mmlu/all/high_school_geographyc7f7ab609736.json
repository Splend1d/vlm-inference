It is measured in degrees, with 0 degrees at the Prime Meridian and 180 degrees east or west.\n\nB. **Latitude**: This is another coordinate system used in geography to specify the north-south position of a point on Earth's surface. It is measured in degrees, with 0 degrees at the Equator and 90 degrees north or south.\n\nC. **Equator**: The Equator is a significant line in geography that divides the Earth into the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. It is not a coordinate system but a geographical line.\n\nD. **Distance to the nearest city**: This is not a coordinate system used in geography to determine absolute location. Instead, it is a measure of proximity to a specific point, which can be useful for understanding accessibility or population density, but it does not provide a precise location.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Distance to the nearest city.",
