            "content": "To understand how biologists interpret the similarities in the structures of human arms, bat wings, and dolphin flippers, we need to consider the concept of homology and evolutionary biology.\n\n1. **Homologous Structures**: These are structures that have a common ancestry. In the context of the question, biologists would look for evidence that suggests these structures have a common evolutionary origin. This is often done by comparing the genetic sequences of the organisms in question. If the genetic sequences are similar, it suggests a common ancestor.\n\n2. **Convergent Evolution**: This is a process where unrelated species develop similar traits independently, often due to similar environmental pressures. While this can explain some similarities, it does not account for the shared evolutionary origin.\n\n3. **Common Ancestor**: This is the idea that all these organisms share a common ancestor. If biologists can establish a common ancestor, it supports the idea that the structures are homologous.\n\nGiven these points, let's analyze the options:\n\n- **Option A: By identifying the bones as being homologous**  \n  This is correct. Identifying homologous structures involves finding evidence that these structures have a common evolutionary origin.\n\n- **Option B: By the principle of convergent evolution**  \n  This is incorrect. Convergent evolution explains similarities that arise independently, not a shared ancestry.\n\n- **Option C: By proposing that humans, bats, and dolphins share a common ancestor**  \n  This is correct. Establishing a common ancestor is a key step in interpreting these structures as homologous.\n\n- **Option D: A and C only**  \n  This is correct. Both identifying homologous structures and proposing a common ancestor are necessary to interpret these similarities.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **D. A and C only**. Biologists interpret these similarities by identifying the bones as homologous and proposing that humans, bats, and dolphins share a common ancestor.",
