This means the Moon rotates about its axis once per day.\n\nThe other options are incorrect because:\n\nB. month: The Moon does not rotate about its axis in a month. A month is about 29.5 days, which is longer than the time it takes for the Moon to complete one rotation.\n\nC. year: The Moon does not rotate about its axis in a year. A year is about 365.25 days, which is longer than the time it takes for the Moon to complete one rotation.\n\nD. None of these for the moon does not rotate about an axis: This option is incorrect because the Moon does rotate about its axis. The fact that we always see the same face of the Moon is evidence of this rotation.",
