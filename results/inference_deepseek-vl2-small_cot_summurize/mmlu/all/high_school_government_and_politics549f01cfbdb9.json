The president does not have the power to call special sessions of Congress. This power is reserved for Congress.\n\nB. The president can introduce bills to the floor of Congress, but this is not a check on the legislative branch. This is a power of the executive branch.\n\nC. The president can address Congress during its debate on bills. This is a check on the legislative branch because it allows the president to influence the legislative process and potentially sway the outcome of a bill.\n\nD. The president does not have the power to vote on acts of Congress. This is a power of Congress.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. The president's power to address Congress during its debate on bills.",
