            "content": "To determine the maximum number of elements that must be examined in a sorted list to find the value 100, we can use the binary search algorithm.\n\nBinary search works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. Starting with the entire list, we divide it into two halves until we find the value or determine that it is not in the list.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:\n\n1. **Initial Division**: The list is divided into two halves. If the middle element is 100, the search is complete.\n\n2. **Subsequent Divisions**: If the middle element is not 100, the list is divided into two halves again. This process continues until the value is found or the list is empty.\n\n3. **Counting Elements**: Each division effectively halves the number of elements to be examined.\n\nGiven that the list is sorted, the number of elements to be examined is halved with each division.\n\n- **First Division**: 120 elements\n- **Second Division**: 60 elements\n- **Third Division**: 30 elements\n- **Fourth Division**: 15 elements\n- **Fifth Division**: 7 elements\n- **Sixth Division**: 3 elements\n- **Seventh Division**: 1 element\n\nThus, the maximum number of elements that must be examined is 7.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 7",
