            "content": "To determine which reaction is most likely to occur based on oxidation-reduction potential, we need to compare the standard reduction potentials of the species involved in each reaction. The species with a higher reduction potential is more likely to be reduced, while the species with a lower reduction potential is more likely to be oxidized.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Al(s) + 3 NaNO3(aq) \u2192 3 Na(s) + Al(NO3)3(aq)\n- Aluminum (Al) has a standard reduction potential of -1.66 V.\n- Sodium (Na) has a standard reduction potential of +0.77 V.\n- Nitric acid (NO3-) is a strong oxidizing agent and does not have a significant reduction potential.\n- In this reaction, aluminum is being oxidized to aluminum nitrate, and sodium is being reduced to sodium nitrate.\n- Since aluminum has a lower reduction potential than sodium, this reaction is not favorable.\n\nB. Zn(s) + 2 AgNO3(aq) \u2192 2 Ag(s) + Zn(NO3)2(aq)\n- Zinc (Zn) has a standard reduction potential of -0.76 V.\n- Silver (Ag) has a standard reduction potential of +0.80 V.\n- Nitric acid (NO3-) is a strong oxidizing agent and does not have a significant reduction potential.\n- In this reaction, zinc is being oxidized to zinc nitrate, and silver is being reduced to silver nitrate.\n- Since zinc has a lower reduction potential than silver, this reaction is not favorable.\n\nC. Pb(s) + Ca(NO3)2(aq) \u2192 Ca(s) + Pb(NO3)2(aq)\n- Lead (Pb) has a standard reduction potential of -0.13 V.\n- Calcium (Ca) has a standard reduction potential of +2.71 V.\n- Nitric acid (NO3-) is a strong oxidizing agent and does not have a significant reduction potential.\n- In this reaction, lead is being oxidized to lead nitrate, and calcium is being reduced to calcium nitrate.\n- Since calcium has a higher reduction potential than lead, this reaction is favorable.\n\nD. Pb(s) + 2 LiNO3(aq) \u2192 2 Li(s) + Pb(NO3)2(aq)\n- Lead (Pb) has a standard reduction potential of -0.13 V.\n- Lithium (Li) has a standard reduction potential of +3.04 V.\n- Nitric acid (NO3-) is a strong oxidizing agent and does not have a significant reduction potential.\n- In this reaction, lead is being oxidized to lead nitrate, and lithium is being reduced to lithium nitrate.\n- Since lithium has a higher reduction potential than lead, this reaction is favorable.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most likely reactions to occur are:\n\nC. Pb(s) + Ca(NO3)2(aq) \u2192 Ca(s) + Pb(NO3)2(aq)\nD. Pb(s) + 2 LiNO3(aq) \u2192 2 Li(s) + Pb(NO3)2(aq)\n\nBoth options C and D are favorable due to the higher reduction potential of the reducing agent (calcium and lithium, respectively) compared to the oxidizing agent (lead).",
