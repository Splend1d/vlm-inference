This method is often associated with the Neolithic Revolution and is not primarily focused on breeding and herding animals for food, shelter, and clothing.\n\nB. **Subsistence farming**: This is a form of agriculture where the primary goal is to produce enough food to feed the farmer and their family. It often involves the use of animals for food, shelter, and clothing, but it is not specifically focused on breeding and herding animals as a lifestyle.\n\nC. **Pastoralism**: This is a way of life based on breeding and herding animals for their meat, milk, and other products. It is a lifestyle that is deeply connected to the land and the animals, and it is often associated with nomadic or semi-nomadic cultures.\n\nD. **Hunting and gathering**: This is a lifestyle where people rely on hunting and gathering wild plants and animals for food and other resources. It is not based on breeding and herding animals.\n\nGiven the definitions and characteristics of each option, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Pastoralism.",
