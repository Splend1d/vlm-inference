This is a well-documented fact in economic literature.\n\n3. **Comparison with High Income Countries**:\n   - High income countries generally experienced higher growth rates during this period. For instance, the average annual growth rate in high income countries was around 2.5% to 3.0%.\n\n4. **Comparison with Britain During the Industrial Revolution**:\n   - The industrial revolution in Britain occurred from the late 18th century to the mid-19th century, roughly from 1760 to 1870. This period is about 110 years long.\n   - During the industrial revolution, the growth rate of income in Britain was much higher, often exceeding 1.0% per year.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given that the growth rate of average incomes in LDCs was approximately 3.0% per year over a 35-year period, and comparing it to the growth rates of high income countries and Britain during the industrial revolution, it is clear that the growth rate in LDCs was higher.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. was approximately 3.0% per year",
