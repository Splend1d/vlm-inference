It is often used by refugees and asylum seekers.\n\nB. **Cluster Migration**: This occurs when groups of people migrate together, often due to shared cultural or social ties. It is common in certain regions and communities.\n\nC. **Circular Migration**: This involves temporary migration for work or education, followed by return to the country of origin. It is often used by seasonal workers or those seeking better opportunities abroad.\n\nD. **International Migration**: This is the movement of people from one country to another, often for permanent residence or employment.\n\nGiven the context of farm workers, who typically move to different regions for seasonal work, the most likely form of migration they would practice is:\n\nC. **Circular Migration**: Farm workers often move to different regions for seasonal work, such as picking crops or working in agricultural settings. After completing their work, they return to their home country. This pattern is consistent with circular migration, where individuals move temporarily for work and then return home.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Circular migration.",
