How many programming statements the program contains\n\nThe number of programming statements in a program does not directly impact its ability to process larger data sets. The program's performance is more influenced by factors such as the amount of memory it requires, the speed of its execution, and the storage space it needs. The number of statements is more related to the complexity and readability of the code rather than its scalability.",
