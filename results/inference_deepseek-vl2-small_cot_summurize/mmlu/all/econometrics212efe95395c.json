It is particularly useful when the distributional properties of the data are unknown or when the sample size is small.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\ni) If it is desired that the distributional properties of the data in the experiment are the same as those of some actual data.\n- Bootstrapping can be used to estimate the distributional properties of the data by comparing the resampled data to the actual data. This is a valid use of bootstrapping.\n\nii) If it is desired that the distributional properties of the data in the experiment are known exactly.\n- Bootstrapping is not suitable for this situation because it involves resampling with replacement, which can introduce variability and does not provide exact distributional properties.\n\niii) If the distributional properties of the actual data are unknown.\n- Bootstrapping is particularly useful in this situation because it allows for the estimation of the distributional properties of the data without making assumptions about the underlying distribution.\n\niv) If the sample of actual data available is very small.\n- Bootstrapping is useful in this situation because it can provide a more accurate estimate of the distributional properties of the data when the sample size is small.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nD.
