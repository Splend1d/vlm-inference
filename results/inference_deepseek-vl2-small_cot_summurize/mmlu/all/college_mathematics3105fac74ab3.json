For example, the function \\( f(x) = 1 \\) for \\( x \\in [0, 1] \\) and \\( f(x) = 0 \\) otherwise is Lebesgue integrable but not Riemann integrable. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Option B: There does not exist a countably infinite \\( E \\) of \\( \\mathbb{R} \\) such that \\( f \\) is nondifferentiable at every \\( x \\in E \\).**\n\n- This statement is not necessarily true. A function can be Lebesgue integrable and have points of nondifferentiability. For example, the function \\( f(x) = x \\) for \\( x \\in [0, 1] \\) and \\( f(x) = 0 \\) otherwise is Lebesgue integrable but not differentiable at \\( x = 0 \\) and \\( x = 1 \\).\n\n**Option C: There does not exist an uncountable subset \\( E \\) of \\( \\mathbb{R} \\) such that \\( f \\) is nondifferentiable at every \\( x \\in E \\).**\n\n- This statement is not necessarily true. A function can be Lebesgue integrable and have points of nondifferentiability. For example, the function \\( f(x) = x^2 \\) for \\( x \\in [0, 1] \\) and \\( f(x) = 0 \\) otherwise is Lebesgue integrable but not differentiable at \\( x = 0 \\) and \\( x = 1 \\).\n\n**Option D: None of the above.**\n\n- Since options A, B, and C are not necessarily true, option D is the correct answer.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{D}\n\\]",
