            "content": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. A well-fitting pouch: A well-fitting pouch is essential for preventing skin irritation and excoriation. If the pouch is too tight or too loose, it can cause pressure points that lead to skin breakdown. Therefore, this option is incorrect because it does not cause excoriation.\n\nB. Changing the pouch every day: While changing the pouch regularly is important for maintaining hygiene and preventing skin irritation, it does not directly cause skin excoriation. The frequency of changing the pouch is more about preventing skin problems rather than causing them.\n\nC. Leakage of effluent onto peristomal skin: This is the correct answer. When there is leakage of the effluent from the pouch onto the peristomal skin, it can cause irritation and lead to skin excoriation. The effluent can be acidic or contain other irritants that can damage the skin, leading to redness, itching, and in severe cases, skin breakdown.\n\nD. The use of unscented soap to cleanse the skin: Using unscented soap is a good practice for maintaining skin health, as it reduces the risk of skin irritation. However, it does not cause skin excoriation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Leakage of effluent onto peristomal skin.",
