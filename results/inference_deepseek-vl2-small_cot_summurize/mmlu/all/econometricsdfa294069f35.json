On average, the estimated coefficient values will equal the true values.\n- This statement is incorrect. Consistency does not imply that the estimated values will always equal the true values. Instead, it means that the average of the estimated values will converge to the true value as the sample size increases.\n\nB. The OLS estimator is unbiased and no other unbiased estimator has a smaller variance.\n- This statement is incorrect. While the OLS estimator is unbiased, it does not imply that it has the smallest variance among all unbiased estimators. Consistency is about the convergence of the estimator to the true value, not about variance.\n\nC. The estimates will converge upon the true values as the sample size increases.\n- This statement is correct. Consistency is defined as the property of an estimator that its average value converges to the true value as the sample size increases. This means that with a larger sample size, the estimates will get closer to the true value.\n\nD. The coefficient estimates will be as close to their true values as possible for small and large samples.\n- This statement is incorrect. Consistency does not guarantee that the estimates will be close to the true values for all sample sizes. It only implies that the average of the estimates will converge to the true value as the sample size increases.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. The estimates will converge upon the true values as the sample size increases.",
