Reliable delivery of large (multi-packet) messages between machines that are not necessarily directly connected\n\nThe IP protocol is the fundamental protocol of the Internet and is responsible for addressing and routing packets of data so that they can travel across networks. It does not directly handle the routing of packets through the network (A), nor does it ensure the reliable delivery of packets between directly connected machines (B). It also does not deal with differences among operating system architectures (D). Instead, it focuses on the reliable delivery of data across networks, which is crucial for the functioning of the Internet.",
