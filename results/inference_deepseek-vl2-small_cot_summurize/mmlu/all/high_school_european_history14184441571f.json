This diversity displays the unsearchable depth of the divine judgment, and is without doubt subordinate to God's purpose of eternal election. But if it is plainly owing to the mere pleasure of God that salvation is spontaneously offered to some, while others have no access to it, great and difficult questions immediately arise, questions which are inexplicable, when just views are not entertained concerning election and predestination[,] . . . the grace of God being illustrated by the contrast, viz., that he does not adopt all promiscuously to the hope of salvation, but gives to some what he denies to others.\n\u2014John Calvin, from The Institutes of Christian Religion, Book 3: Chapter 21, 1545\nWhich of the following is the biggest contrast between the ideas of Calvinists when compared to their fellow Protestant Lutherans?\n\nA. Calvinists believed that the state is absolutely subordinate to the religious organization.\nB. Calvinists believed in consubstantiation while Lutherans believed in transubstantiation.\nC. Lutherans used the reformed faith to their political advantage to break free from domination from the pope and the Holy Roman Empire.\nD. Lutherans insisted upon maintaining all of the seven sacraments while the Calvinists chose to honor only two of them.\n",

Both Calvinists and Lutherans believed in the supremacy of the church over the state.\n\nOption B is not a contrast, but rather a similarity. Both Calvinists and Lutherans believed in the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist, although they had different views on how this presence is understood.\n\nOption C is not a contrast, but rather a similarity. Both Calvinists and Lutherans used the reformed faith to their political advantage to break free from domination from the pope and the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nOption D is a contrast. Lutherans insisted upon maintaining all of the seven sacraments, while the Calvinists chose to honor only two of them. This is a significant difference between the two groups.\n\nTherefore, the biggest contrast between the ideas of Calvinists and Lutherans is that Lutherans insisted upon maintaining all of the seven sacraments while the Calvinists chose to honor only two of them.\n\nSo, the final answer is $\\boxed{D}$.",
