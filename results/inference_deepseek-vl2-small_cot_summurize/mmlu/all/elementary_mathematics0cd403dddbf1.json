We can express this as an equation:\n\n\\[ 7 = 0.05x \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we need to solve for \\( x \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.05:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{7}{0.05} \\]\n\n\\[ x = 140 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of coins in Kate's collection is 140.\n\nThe correct answer is D. 140.",
