It is a measure of how much mass is contained within a given volume.\n\n2. **Comparing Pumice and Water**:\n   - **Pumice**: Pumice is a type of volcanic rock that is known for its very low density. It is composed mainly of lightweight minerals like pyroxene and feldspar, which are gases trapped in the rock.\n   - **Water**: Water has a density of approximately 1 gram per cubic centimeter (g/cm\u00b3) at 4\u00b0C.\n\n3. **Calculating the Density of Pumice**:\n   - Since pumice is much less dense than water, we can estimate its density by comparing it to water. Pumice is typically about 200-300 times less dense than water.\n   - If water has a density of 1 g/cm\u00b3, then pumice would have a density of approximately 0.002-0.003 g/cm\u00b3.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given that pumice is significantly less dense than water, the correct answer is:\n\nA. less.",
