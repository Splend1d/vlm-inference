            "content": "To determine which change would have the greatest deleterious effect, we need to consider the role of each codon in the protein synthesis process.\n\n1. **A. a deletion of a single nucleotide**: Deleting a single nucleotide can lead to a frameshift mutation. This type of mutation changes the reading frame of the mRNA, which can result in a completely different sequence of amino acids being synthesized. This can lead to a nonfunctional protein, which is often deleterious.\n\n2. **B. a deletion of a nucleotide triplet**: Deleting a triplet of nucleotides (codon) can also cause a frameshift mutation. However, the effect is less severe than a single nucleotide deletion because the reading frame is not completely disrupted. The protein may still be partially functional, depending on the location of the deletion.\n\n3. **C. a single nucleotide substitution of the nucleotide occupying the first codon position**: Substituting a single nucleotide at the first codon position can lead to a frameshift mutation if the substitution is not one of the standard codons (A, U, G, or C). This can result in a completely different sequence of amino acids, potentially leading to a nonfunctional protein.\n\n4. **D. a single nucleotide substitution of the nucleotide occupying the third codon position**: Substituting a single nucleotide at the third codon position is less likely to cause a frameshift mutation because the third codon is usually a stop codon (UAA, UAG, or UGA). If the substitution is not a stop codon, it may lead to a premature stop codon, resulting in a truncated protein. However, this is less likely to cause a frameshift compared to a substitution at the first codon position.\n\nConsidering these explanations, the change that would most likely have the greatest deleterious effect is:\n\n**A. a deletion of a single nucleotide**\n\nThis is because a single nucleotide deletion can cause a frameshift mutation, leading to a completely different sequence of amino acids and potentially a nonfunctional protein.",
