In this case, the teenager's actions are serious and violate societal norms deeply.\n\n2. **Folkways**: These are the norms that are not enforced by law but are considered important by society. The teenager's actions of leaving no tip at the bar and vomiting on the steps to the door of a church are considered folkways violations.\n\n3. **The Law**: This includes actions that are illegal or against societal rules enforced by law. The teenager's consensual sexual intercourse with his sister is not illegal, so it is not a violation of the law.\n\n4. **Mores**: These are the moral standards that are considered important by society. The teenager's actions of having consensual sexual intercourse with his sister and non-consensual sexual relations with an unknown woman are considered mores violations.\n\nGiven this hierarchy, the sequence of violations is:\n\n- **Taboo**: The teenager's actions are serious and violate societal norms deeply.\n- **Folkways**: The teenager's actions of leaving no tip and vomiting are considered folkways violations.\n- **Mores**: The teenager's actions of having consensual and non-consensual sexual relations are considered mores violations.\n\nTherefore, the correct sequence is:\n\nB. taboo, folkways, the law, and taboo",
