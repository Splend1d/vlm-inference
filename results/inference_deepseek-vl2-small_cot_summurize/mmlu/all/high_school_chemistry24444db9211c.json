CH3CH2CH2CH3 (Butane) is a nonpolar molecule with only London dispersion forces.\n\nB. CH3CH2CH2CH2OH (Butanol) is a polar molecule with both dipole-dipole interactions and hydrogen bonding.\n\nC. CH3CH2CH2CH2Cl (Chlorobutane) is a polar molecule with dipole-dipole interactions and London dispersion forces.\n\nD. CH3CH2CH2CH2Br (Bromobutane) is a polar molecule with dipole-dipole interactions and London dispersion forces.\n\nAmong these, butanol (B) has the highest boiling point due to the presence of hydrogen bonding, which is stronger than dipole-dipole interactions and London dispersion forces. Hydrogen bonding requires more energy to break, resulting in a higher boiling point.\n\nTherefore, the molecule expected to have the highest normal boiling point is:\n\nB. CH3CH2CH2CH2OH",
