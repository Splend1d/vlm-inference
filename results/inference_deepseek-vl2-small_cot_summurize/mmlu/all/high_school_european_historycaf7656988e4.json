            "content": "The passage from Henry IV of France's The Edict of Nantes, 1598, clearly states that he intended for the Catholic Apostolic and Roman religion to be restored and reestablished in all places and localities of his kingdom and countries subject to his sway. He also permitted those of the said religion called Reformed to live and abide in all the cities and places of his kingdom and countries of his sway, without being annoyed, molested, or compelled to do anything in the matter of religion contrary to their consciences.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Henry IV intended for Protestants to be able to live peacefully in his kingdom.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the edict does not ban Protestants from France. Instead, it allows them to live and practice their religion without being molested or compelled to do anything contrary to their consciences.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the edict does not state that Henry IV was converting to Catholicism. Instead, it states that he intended to restore and reestablish the Catholic Apostolic and Roman religion.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the edict does not state that Henry IV was converting to Protestantism. Instead, it states that he permitted those of the Reformed religion to live and practice their religion without being molested or compelled to do anything contrary to their consciences.\n\nSo, the final answer is $\\boxed{B}$.",
