This means that the force exerted by the board on the hand is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the force exerted by the hand on the board.\n\nGiven that the force delivered by the karate chop is 3000 N, the force exerted by the board on the hand will also be 3000 N. This is because the action and reaction forces are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 3000 N",
