The work done on them:\n- For a compressed spring, the work done on it is stored as potential energy. This is because the spring is being compressed, and the work done by an external force is converted into potential energy.\n- For a charged object, the work done on it can also be stored as potential energy. When a charge is moved in an electric field, work is done on it, and this work can be stored as potential energy.\n\nB. Motion:\n- Motion is not a factor that directly affects the potential energy of a spring or a charged object. Potential energy is a state function, meaning it depends only on the current state of the system, not on the path taken to reach that state.\n\nC. Both of these:\n- Since both work done on a spring and work done on a charged object can result in potential energy being stored, this option is correct.\n\nD. Neither of these:\n- This option is incorrect because work done on a spring and a charged object both contribute to the potential energy.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Both of these.",
