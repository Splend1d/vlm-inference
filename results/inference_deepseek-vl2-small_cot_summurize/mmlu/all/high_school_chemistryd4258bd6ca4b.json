This means that the interactions between the solute and solvent molecules are similar to the interactions between the individual solvents.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. A mixture where two solvents can be dissolved in all ratios: This describes a solution, not an ideal solution. An ideal solution is not about the solvents being able to dissolve in all ratios; it's about the potential energy of the mixture being the same as that of the individual solvents.\n\nB. A mixture that has the same physical properties as the individual solvents: This describes a solution, not an ideal solution. An ideal solution is not about the physical properties of the solvents being the same; it's about the potential energy of the mixture being the same as that of the individual solvents.\n\nC. A mixture where the potential energy of the mixture is the same as that of the individual solvents: This is the correct definition of an ideal solution. The potential energy of the mixture is the same as that of the individual solvents because the interactions between the solute and solvent molecules are similar to the interactions between the individual solvents.\n\nD. A mixture that is colorless: This is not a definition of an ideal solution. The color of a solution is not related to whether it is an ideal solution or not.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. An ideal solution is a mixture where the potential energy of the mixture is the same as that of the individual solvents.\n\nSo, the final answer is $\\boxed{C}$.",
