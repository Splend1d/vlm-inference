Higher electrical conductivities: This is important because the electrode needs to efficiently conduct electricity to create the necessary heat for welding.\n\nB. Higher thermal conductivities: This is crucial because the electrode must be able to dissipate heat effectively to maintain the high temperatures required for welding.\n\nC. Sufficient strength to sustain high pressure at elevated temperatures: The electrode must be strong enough to withstand the mechanical forces and thermal stresses during the welding process.\n\nAll three properties are essential for the electrode to perform effectively in electrical resistance welding.",
