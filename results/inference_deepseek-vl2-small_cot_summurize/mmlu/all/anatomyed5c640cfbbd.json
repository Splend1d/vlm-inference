This connection allows blood to bypass the non-functioning fetal lungs and flow directly from the right ventricle to the aorta, where it can be oxygenated by the placenta. After birth, the ductus arteriosus typically closes as the newborn begins to breathe air and the lungs become functional.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nC. pulmonary artery to the aorta.",
