            "content": "To determine which gas molecules have the greatest average speed, we need to consider the kinetic energy of the molecules. The average speed of a gas molecule is directly related to its kinetic energy, which is given by the equation:\n\n\\[ KE = \\frac{1}{2} m v^2 \\]\n\nwhere \\( KE \\) is the kinetic energy, \\( m \\) is the mass of the molecule, and \\( v \\) is the velocity (or speed) of the molecule.\n\nThe kinetic energy of a molecule is also proportional to the temperature of the gas. Therefore, the gas with the highest temperature will have the molecules with the greatest average speed.\n\nIn a mixture of hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen gases, the temperature of the mixture is determined by the temperature of the gas with the highest average speed. Since nitrogen has the highest molar mass among the three gases, it will have the lowest average speed at a given temperature. Conversely, hydrogen, having the lowest molar mass, will have the highest average speed.\n\nThus, the molecules with the greatest average speed are those of hydrogen.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nA. hydrogen.",
