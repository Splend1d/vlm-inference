            "content": "To find the number of points of intersection between a circle and a parabola, we need to solve the system of equations formed by the circle and the parabola.\n\nThe equation of the parabola is \\(x^2 = y + 4\\).\n\nThe equation of the circle is \\(x^2 + y^2 = r^2\\), where \\(r\\) is the radius of the circle.\n\nSubstitute \\(y = x^2 - 4\\) into the equation of the circle:\n\\[ x^2 + (x^2 - 4)^2 = r^2 \\Rightarrow x^2 + x^4 - 8x^2 + 16 = r^2 \\Rightarrow x^4 - 7x^2 + 16 - r^2 = 0 \\]\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in \\(x^2\\). Let \\(u = x^2\\):\n\\[ u^2 - 7u + 16 - r^2 = 0 \\]\n\nSolve for \\(u\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\\[ u = \\frac{-(-7) \\pm \\sqrt{(-7)^2 - 4(1)(16 - r^2)}}{2(1)} \\Rightarrow u = \\frac{7 \\pm \\sqrt{49 - 64 + 4r^2}}{2} \\Rightarrow u = \\frac{7 \\pm \\sqrt{4r^2 - 15}}{2} \\]\n\nSince \\(u = x^2\\), we have:\n\\[ x^2 = \\frac{7 \\pm \\sqrt{4r^2 - 15}}{2} \\]\n\nFor each value of \\(r\\), we get two values of \\(x^2\\). However, we need to consider the number of distinct points of intersection.\n\nNotice that the parabola \\(x^2 = y + 4\\) is symmetric about the y-axis. Therefore, the number of points of intersection is the same for both positive and negative values of \\(x\\).\n\nThe number of points of intersection is equal to the number of distinct values of \\(x^2\\). Since \\(x^2\\) can take on two values for each value of \\(r\\), the total number of points of intersection is \\(2r\\).\n\nThe answer is:\n\\[ 2r \\]",
