It is not about planting and harvesting the same crop more than once a year.\n\nB. **Double cropping**: This is the practice of growing two crops in one year on the same piece of land. This is exactly what the question describes. The farmer plants and harvests the same crop more than once a year, which is a key characteristic of double cropping.\n\nC. **Pastoralism**: This is a type of agriculture where livestock are raised on pastureland. It does not involve the cultivation of crops.\n\nD. **Intertillage**: This is a method of crop rotation where two or more crops are grown in the same field in a sequence, but it does not specifically refer to the same crop being planted and harvested more than once a year.\n\nAfter evaluating each option, the correct answer is **B. double cropping**, as it accurately describes the practice of growing the same crop more than once a year.",
