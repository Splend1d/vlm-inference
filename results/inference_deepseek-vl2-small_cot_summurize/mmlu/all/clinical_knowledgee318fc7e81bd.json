They are diploid, meaning they contain two sets of chromosomes.\n\n2. **Chromosome Number in Somatic Cells**: In humans, somatic cells contain 46 chromosomes. This number is derived from the combination of 23 pairs of chromosomes. Each pair consists of one chromosome inherited from each parent.\n\n3. **Explanation of Options**:\n   - **Option A (3)**: This is incorrect because 3 chromosomes would not be sufficient to form a complete set for a human cell.\n   - **Option B (20)**: This is incorrect because 20 chromosomes would be insufficient for a human cell, as humans have 46 chromosomes.\n   - **Option C (23)**: This is incorrect because 23 chromosomes would be insufficient for a human cell, as humans have 46 chromosomes.\n   - **Option D (46)**: This is correct. Human somatic cells contain 46 chromosomes, organized into 23 pairs.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **D. 46**.",
