            "content": "To determine which option is not an example of sensory adaptation, we need to understand what sensory adaptation is. Sensory adaptation refers to the process by which the sensory receptors in the body become less responsive to constant stimuli. This means that after a period of time, the sensory input from the environment becomes less noticeable or less intense.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. After putting on a shirt, you eventually no longer feel the sensation of the fabric on your back. This is an example of sensory adaptation because the sensation of the fabric becomes less noticeable over time as you get used to wearing it.\n\nB. After first walking into a crowded room, you no longer are distracted by the buzz of conversation around you. This is also an example of sensory adaptation. Initially, the sounds of the crowd might be overwhelming, but over time, you become less distracted by the noise.\n\nC. After first walking outside on a sunny day, you no longer are blinded by the initial brightness of the light. This is another example of sensory adaptation. The initial brightness of sunlight can be overwhelming, but your eyes adjust to the light, and you become less sensitive to it over time.\n\nD. After first walking into an anatomy lab, you no longer notice the smell of formaldehyde. This is not an example of sensory adaptation. The smell of formaldehyde is a constant stimulus in the anatomy lab, and it is not something that you get used to or become less sensitive to over time. The smell remains noticeable and constant, unlike the other examples where the sensory input becomes less noticeable.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. After first walking into an anatomy lab, you no longer notice the smell of formaldehyde. This is not an example of sensory adaptation.",
