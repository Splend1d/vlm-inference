He plans to have a Book class that stores features of each book: author, title, isOnShelf, and so on, with operations like getAuthor, getTitle, getShelfInfo, and setShelfInfo. Another class, LibraryList, will store an array of Book objects. The LibraryList class will include operations such as listAllBooks, addBook, removeBook, and searchForBook.

In this case, the programmer begins by designing the Book class, which is a fundamental unit of the library system. The Book class is designed to handle the basic features of a book, such as author, title, and shelf information. Once the Book class is fully functional and tested, the programmer can then build upon it to create the LibraryList class, which will manage an array of Book objects and provide additional functionalities like listing all books, adding books, removing books, and searching for books.\n\nThis approach ensures that the basic components are well-defined and tested before moving on to more complex interactions and data structures.",
