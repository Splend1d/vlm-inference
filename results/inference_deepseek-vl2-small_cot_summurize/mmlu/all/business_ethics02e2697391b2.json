Consequentialist, Cost-benefit analysis:\n- Consequentialist reasoning involves making decisions based on their outcomes. It is a practical approach often used in business to evaluate the potential benefits and drawbacks of a decision.\n- Cost-benefit analysis is a specific method used within consequentialist reasoning to weigh the costs against the benefits of a decision.\n\nB. Rationalised, Annual audit:\n- Rationalised reasoning is a more abstract concept, often associated with logical and systematic decision-making processes.\n- An annual audit is a financial review process, not a form of reasoning.\n\nC. Consequentialist, Annual audit:\n- While consequentialist reasoning is appropriate, an annual audit is not a form of reasoning.\n\nD.
