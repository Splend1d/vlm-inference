The UN operates a worldwide police force.\n- The United Nations does not operate a worldwide police force. While the UN has peacekeeping missions, these are not a police force in the traditional sense. They are authorized to observe, report, and assist in conflict resolution.\n\nB. Member states surrender sovereignty to the UN.\n- This statement is incorrect. The UN does not have the authority to force member states to surrender sovereignty. While member states agree to abide by UN resolutions and participate in UN activities, they retain their sovereignty.\n\nC. World laws are enforced by the UN.\n- The UN does not enforce world laws. It is an international organization that promotes peace, security, and cooperation among nations. It does not have the power to enforce laws; that is the role of national and international courts.\n\nD. The UN often practices interventionism in world conflicts.\n- This statement is accurate. The UN has been involved in various interventions to maintain peace and security, such as the Korean War, the Vietnam War, and the intervention in Somalia. These actions are often referred to as \"interventionism\" because they involve the UN taking action to prevent or stop conflicts.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the statement that best describes the United Nations is:\n\nD. The UN often practices interventionism in world conflicts.",
