Customers\u2019 personal information could be compromised if an unauthorized individual gains access to the call session database.\n- This option suggests a vulnerability in the database where unauthorized access could lead to data breaches. This is a common concern in systems that store sensitive information, as it directly impacts the security of personal data.\n\nB. Storing information in the call session database makes it easy for individuals to trick the system using malicious links.\n- This option implies a vulnerability in the system's ability to detect and prevent malicious activities. While this is a concern, it is more about the system's security mechanisms rather than the storage of data itself.\n\nC. The system design increases the chance that customers will unknowingly install malware on their devices that will share their data with unauthorized individuals.\n- This option focuses on the installation of malware, which is a separate issue from data storage. It does not directly address the privacy concern related to the system's data storage.\n\nD. The system design makes it easy for unauthorized individuals to acquire customers\u2019 private encryption keys.\n- This option suggests a vulnerability in the encryption process, which could lead to unauthorized access to encrypted data. However, it does not directly relate to the storage of data in the call session database.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the most likely data privacy concern of the upgraded system is:\n\nA.
