Unbiasedness means that the expected value of the estimator is equal to the true parameter value. Efficiency means that the estimator has the smallest variance among all unbiased estimators.\n\nB. **It will be consistent and unbiased but not efficient**: This option suggests that the estimator is unbiased and converges to the true parameter value, but it does not have the smallest variance.\n\nC. **It will be consistent but not unbiased**: This option indicates that the estimator is unbiased, meaning its expected value equals the true parameter value, but it may not converge to the true parameter value as the sample size increases.\n\nD. **It will not be consistent**: This option suggests that the estimator does not converge to the true parameter value as the sample size increases.\n\nIn the presence of multicollinearity, the OLS estimator is not consistent. Multicollinearity occurs when two or more independent variables in a regression model are highly correlated. This correlation can lead to unstable estimates of the coefficients, making the OLS estimator inconsistent.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. It will not be consistent.",
