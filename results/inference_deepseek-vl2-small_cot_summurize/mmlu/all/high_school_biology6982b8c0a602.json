            "content": "To determine the correct answer, we need to understand the behavior of an animal cell when placed in a hypotonic solution, such as freshwater.\n\n1. **Understanding the Environment**: The cell is in a hypotonic solution, which means the external solution has a lower concentration of solutes (like NaCl) compared to the inside of the cell.\n\n2. **Cellular Response to Hypotonic Solutions**: In a hypotonic solution, water moves into the cell by osmosis. This is because water tends to move from areas of lower solute concentration to areas of higher solute concentration.\n\n3. **Effect on the Cell**: As water enters the cell, the cell will swell due to the influx of water. If the influx of water continues unchecked, the cell may eventually burst (lyse) because the cell membrane cannot withstand the pressure of the expanding cell.\n\n4. **Evaluating the Options**:\n   - **A. Plasmolyze**: This refers to the separation of the cell membrane from the cell wall, which typically occurs in a hypertonic solution where water exits the cell. This is not the case here.\n   - **B. Swell and eventually lyse**: This is the correct response. The cell will swell due to water entering and eventually burst if the influx of water is not stopped.\n   - **C. Endocytose water into a large central vacuole**: This is not a typical response to a hypotonic solution. Endocytosis is a process where cells engulf external substances, not water.\n   - **D. shrivel**: This would occur in a hypertonic solution where water exits the cell, not a hypotonic solution.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. swell and eventually lyse**.",
