Ability to magnify distant objects: This refers to the telescope's power to enlarge the apparent size of distant objects. While magnification is a crucial aspect of a telescope's function, it is not what the resolution measures.\n\nB. Ability to measure the angular separation of objects: Resolution is a measure of how well a telescope can distinguish between two closely spaced objects. It is defined as the smallest angle between two objects that can be resolved by the telescope. This is a key aspect of a telescope's performance, as it determines the telescope's ability to see fine details.\n\nC. Ability to measure the distance between objects: This is not related to resolution. Distance measurement is typically done using other instruments or methods.\n\nD. Light-collecting efficiency: While the efficiency of a telescope in collecting light is important, it does not directly relate to resolution.\n\nAfter evaluating each option, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Ability to measure the angular separation of objects.",
