There is heritable variation among individuals.\n- This statement is an observation. Natural selection relies on the presence of genetic variation within a population. Without variation, there would be no differences in traits to be selected for or against.\n\nB. Poorly adapted individuals never produce offspring.\n- This statement is an inference. It is a consequence of natural selection, where individuals with traits that are less suited to their environment are less likely to survive and reproduce.\n\nC. Species produce more offspring than the environment can support.\n- This statement is an observation. It reflects the concept of overpopulation, where the number of offspring exceeds the available resources, leading to competition for survival.\n\nD. Individuals whose characteristics are best suited to the environment generally leave more offspring than those whose characteristics are less suited.\n- This statement is an inference. It is a direct outcome of natural selection, where individuals with advantageous traits are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing on their genes to the next generation.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the statement that is not an observation or inference on which natural selection is based is:\n\nC. Species produce more offspring than the environment can support.\n\nThis statement is an observation, not an inference. It describes a situation that can lead to natural selection but is not a conclusion drawn from the process itself.",
