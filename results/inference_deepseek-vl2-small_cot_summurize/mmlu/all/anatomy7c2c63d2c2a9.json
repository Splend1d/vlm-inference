It is located in the lower right quadrant of the abdomen, not the left upper quadrant.\n\nB. **Duodenum**: The duodenum is the first part of the small intestine, located in the upper left quadrant of the abdomen. It is not beneath the diaphragm.\n\nC. **Spleen**: The spleen is an organ located in the upper left quadrant of the abdomen, just beneath the diaphragm. It is responsible for filtering blood and storing red blood cells.\n\nD. **Pancreas**: The pancreas is a glandular organ located in the upper abdomen, behind the stomach. It is not beneath the diaphragm.\n\nBy analyzing the anatomical locations and functions of these organs, we can conclude that the spleen is the organ located beneath the diaphragm in the left upper quadrant of the abdominal cavity.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Spleen.",
