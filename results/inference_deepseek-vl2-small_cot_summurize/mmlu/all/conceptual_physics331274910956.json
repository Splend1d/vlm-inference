The current flowing through the circuit is the same at every point because there is only one path for the current to take.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Increases**: This would imply that the current in the power source increases as more lamps are added. However, in a series circuit, the current remains constant because there is only one path for the current to flow.\n\nB. **Decreases**: This would suggest that the current decreases as more lamps are added. Again, this is incorrect because the current remains constant in a series circuit.\n\nC. **Remains the same**: This is the correct answer. In a series circuit, the current in the power source does not change regardless of the number of lamps connected. The current is determined by the power source and the total resistance of the circuit, which remains constant.\n\nD. **None of these**: This option is incorrect because option C is the correct answer.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. The current in the power source remains the same as more lamps are connected to a series circuit.",
