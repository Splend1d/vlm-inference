            "content": "To determine why the sky appears blue, we need to understand the scattering of light by molecules in the Earth's atmosphere.\n\n1. **Understanding Light Scattering**: When sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere, it encounters molecules of gases such as nitrogen (N\u2082) and oxygen (O\u2082). These molecules scatter the light in all directions.\n\n2. **Color of Light**: Sunlight is composed of a spectrum of colors, each with a different wavelength. Blue light has a shorter wavelength compared to red light.\n\n3. **Scattering by Molecules**: According to the Rayleigh scattering theory, the scattering of light is more effective for shorter wavelengths (blue light) than for longer wavelengths (red light). This is because the shorter wavelengths are scattered in all directions more efficiently.\n\n4. **Effect on Sky Color**: As a result of this scattering, the sky appears blue. The blue light is scattered in all directions, making the sky visible to our eyes.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\n- **Option A**: The Sun mainly emits blue light. This is incorrect because the Sun emits a broad spectrum of light, including all colors.\n\n- **Option B**: The atmosphere absorbs mostly blue light. This is incorrect because the atmosphere does not absorb blue light; it scatters it.\n\n- **Option C**: Molecules scatter red light more effectively than blue light. This is incorrect because blue light is scattered more effectively.\n\n- **Option D**: Molecules scatter blue light more effectively than red light. This is correct because the shorter wavelength of blue light leads to more scattering.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **D. molecules scatter blue light more effectively than red light**.",
