To isolate \\( y \\), divide both sides of the equation by \\(-2.3\\):\n   \\[\n   y = \\frac{-17.02}{-2.3}\n   \\]\n\n3. Perform the division:\n   \\[\n   y = \\frac{-17.02}{-2.3} = 7.4\n   \\]\n\nSo, the solution to the equation is \\( y = 7.4 \\).\n\nNow, let's check our answer by substituting \\( y = 7.4 \\) back into the original equation:\n\\[\n-17.02 = -2.3 \\times 7.4\n\\]\n\n4. Calculate the right-hand side:\n   \\[\n   -17.02 = -17.02\n   \\]\n\nSince both sides of the equation are equal, the solution is correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{A}\n\\]",
