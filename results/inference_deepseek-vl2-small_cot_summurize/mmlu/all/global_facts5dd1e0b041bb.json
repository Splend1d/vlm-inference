According to the survey, the percentage of respondents who reported paying a bribe to access public services in Mexico was 51%.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\nA. 31% - This option is too low, as it does not match the reported percentage of 51%.\nB. 51% - This option matches the reported percentage from the survey.\nC. 71% - This option is too high, as it exceeds the reported percentage.\nD. 91% - This option is even higher than the reported percentage, which is not supported by the survey data.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 51%.",
