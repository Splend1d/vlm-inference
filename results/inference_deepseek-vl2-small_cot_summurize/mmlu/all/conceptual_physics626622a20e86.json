            "content": "The correct answer is C. flying faster than sound.\n\nA sonic boom occurs when an aircraft travels at a speed greater than the speed of sound, typically around Mach 1 (1,235 km/h or 767 mph at sea level). This speed is the threshold at which the aircraft generates a shock wave that creates the boom.\n\nLet's briefly explain why the other options are incorrect:\n\nA. breaking the sound barrier: This is a common misconception. The sound barrier is not a physical barrier but a psychological one. It is the point at which the aircraft's speed approaches the speed of sound, causing the aircraft to generate a shock wave.\n\nB. pulling out of a subsonic dive: This is not related to the production of a sonic boom. A subsonic dive is when an aircraft is flying at a speed slower than the speed of sound, and it does not produce a sonic boom.\n\nD. Each of these produces a sonic boom: This is incorrect. Only option C is correct. The other options do not relate to the production of a sonic boom.",
