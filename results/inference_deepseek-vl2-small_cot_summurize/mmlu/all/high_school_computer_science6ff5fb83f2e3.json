Compare the experimental results to the results provided by the simulation.\n\nThis option is the most appropriate for validating the model used in the simulation. By comparing the experimental results to the simulation results, you can determine the accuracy and reliability of the simulation model. This approach allows you to identify any discrepancies or errors in the model and make necessary adjustments to improve its accuracy.",
