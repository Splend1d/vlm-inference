            "content": "To determine which statement is true about Cushing's Syndrome, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. It is due to a deficiency of cortisol hormone: This statement is incorrect. Cushing's Syndrome is characterized by an excess of cortisol, not a deficiency. The overproduction of cortisol leads to the symptoms associated with the condition.\n\nB. Enlarged extremities are commonly seen: This statement is also incorrect. In Cushing's Syndrome, the most common physical features are a moon face ( rounded cheeks) and a buffalo hump (a fatty deposit on the upper back). Enlarged extremities are not typically associated with this condition.\n\nC. Osteoporosis is not a feature: This statement is incorrect. Osteoporosis is a common feature of Cushing's Syndrome. The excess cortisol can lead to bone loss, resulting in osteoporosis.\n\nD. A moon face and a buffalo hump are characteristic of the disease: This statement is correct. The hallmark features of Cushing's Syndrome include a moon face, which is characterized by a round, puffy appearance of the face, and a buffalo hump, which is a fatty deposit on the upper back.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. A moon face and a buffalo hump are characteristic of the disease.",
