Transfusing the blood unit as soon as possible and annotating the patient's notes with the time of administration.\n- Transfusing the blood unit immediately could pose significant risks to the patient, as the blood may have undergone changes that could affect its safety and efficacy. Therefore, this option is not advisable.\n\nB. Disposing of the contents in the sluice area, keeping the bag for record purposes.\n- This option suggests discarding the blood unit, which is not a recommended practice. Blood units should be handled with care, and discarding them without proper evaluation is not a standard procedure.\n\nC. Returning it to the blood bank and informing them of why you have done so.\n- Returning the blood unit to the blood bank is a responsible action. It allows the blood bank to assess the unit for any potential issues and decide whether it is safe for transfusion. This option is the most appropriate and responsible course of action.\n\nD. Refrigerating for a minimum of 12 hours and then administering it.\n- Refrigerating the blood unit for 12 hours is not a standard practice for handling out-of-refrigeration blood. This option does not address the immediate concern of the blood unit being out of refrigeration for an extended period.\n\nAfter evaluating each option, the most appropriate and responsible action is:\n\nC. Return it to the blood bank and inform them of why you have done so.",
