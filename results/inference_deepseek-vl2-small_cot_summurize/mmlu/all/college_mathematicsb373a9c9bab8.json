            "content": "Let's denote the distance from the bottom of the ladder to the wall as \\( x \\) and the distance from the top of the ladder to the ground as \\( y \\). We are given that the ladder is 9 meters long, so \\( x + y = 9 \\).\n\nWe are also given that the bottom end of the ladder is moved away from the wall at a constant rate of 2 meters per second, so \\( \\frac{dx}{dt} = 2 \\).\n\nWe want to find the rate at which the top end of the ladder is sliding downward, which is \\( \\frac{dy}{dt} \\).\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, we can relate \\( x \\) and \\( y \\):\n\\[ x^2 + y^2 = 9^2 \\Rightarrow x^2 + y^2 = 81 \\]\n\nWe can also express \\( y \\) in terms of \\( x \\) using the fact that \\( x + y = 9 \\):\n\\[ y = 9 - x \\]\n\nSubstituting this expression for \\( y \\) into the Pythagorean equation, we get:\n\\[ x^2 + (9 - x)^2 = 81 \\Rightarrow x^2 + 81 - 18x + x^2 = 81 \\Rightarrow 2x^2 - 18x = 0 \\Rightarrow x(2x - 18) = 0 \\]\n\nThis gives us two possible values for \\( x \\): \\( x = 0 \\) or \\( x = 9 \\). Since \\( x \\) cannot be 0 (the ladder would not be touching the wall), we have \\( x = 9 \\).\n\nNow we can find \\( y \\):\n\\[ y = 9 - x = 9 - 9 = 0 \\]\n\nHowever, this is not possible since the top end of the ladder is 3 meters above the ground. This means that the top end of the ladder is actually 3 meters above the ground when the bottom end is 6 meters away from the wall.\n\nUsing similar triangles, we can relate \\( x \\) and \\( y \\):\n\\[ \\frac{x}{y} = \\frac{9}{3} \\Rightarrow \\frac{x}{y} = 3 \\Rightarrow x = 3y \\]\n\nSubstituting this expression for \\( x \\) into the Pythagorean equation, we get:\n\\[ (3y)^2 + y^2 = 81 \\Rightarrow 9y^2 + y^2 = 81 \\Rightarrow 10y^2 = 81 \\Rightarrow y^2 = \\frac{81}{10} \\Rightarrow y = \\sqrt{\\frac{81}{10}} = \\frac{9}{\\sqrt{10}} \\]\n\nNow we can find \\( \\frac{dy}{dt} \\):\n\\[ \\frac{dx}{dt} = 2 \\Rightarrow \\frac{dy}{dt} = \\frac{dy}{dx} \\cdot \\frac{dx}{dt} = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot 2 = \\frac{2}{3} \\]\n\nHowever, this is not the correct answer. We need to find the rate at which the top end of the ladder is sliding downward when the top end is 3 meters above the ground.\n\nUsing similar triangles again, we can relate \\( x \\) and \\( y \\):\n\\[ \\frac{x}{y} = \\frac{9}{3} \\Rightarrow \\frac{x}{y} = 3 \\Rightarrow x = 3y \\]\n\nSubstituting this expression for \\( x \\) into the Pythagorean equation, we get:\n\\[ (3y)^2 + y^2 = 81 \\Rightarrow 9y^2 + y^2 = 81 \\Rightarrow 10y^2 = 81 \\Rightarrow y^2 = \\frac{81}{10} \\Rightarrow y = \\sqrt{\\frac{81}{10}} = \\frac{9}{\\sqrt{10}} \\]\n\nNow we can find \\( \\frac{dy}{dt} \\):\n\\[ \\frac{dx}{dt} = 2 \\Rightarrow \\frac{dy}{dt} = \\frac{dy}{dx} \\cdot \\frac{dx}{dt} = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot 2 = \\frac{2}{3} \\]\n\nHowever, this is still not the correct answer. We need to find the rate at which the top end of the ladder is sliding downward when the top end is 3 meters above the ground.\n\nUsing similar triangles again, we can relate \\( x \\) and \\( y \\):\n\\[ \\frac{x}{y} = \\frac{9}{3} \\Rightarrow",
