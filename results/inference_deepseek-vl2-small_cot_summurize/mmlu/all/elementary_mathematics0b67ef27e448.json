So, the mean of the original list is:\n\\[ \\text{Mean} = \\frac{1 + 3 + 3}{3} = \\frac{7}{3} \\]\n\nThe median is the middle number when the numbers are arranged in order. Since there are three numbers, the median is the second number, which is 3.\n\nNow, let's add the number 6 to the list: 1, 3, 3, 6.\n\nThe new mean is:\n\\[ \\text{New Mean} = \\frac{1 + 3 + 3 + 6}{4} = \\frac{13}{4} \\]\n\nThe new median is the middle number, which is 3.\n\nComparing the new mean and median to the original mean and median, we can see that:\n\n- The mean has increased.\n- The median has not changed.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\\[ \\text{A. the mean would increase.} \\]",
