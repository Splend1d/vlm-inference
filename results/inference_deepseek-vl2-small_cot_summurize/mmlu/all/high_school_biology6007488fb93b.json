            "content": "To determine which characteristic allows you to distinguish a prokaryotic cell from an animal cell, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Ribosomes**: Both prokaryotic and animal cells contain ribosomes, which are responsible for protein synthesis. Therefore, ribosomes are not a distinguishing feature between the two cell types.\n\nB. **Cell membrane**: Both prokaryotic and animal cells have cell membranes. The cell membrane is a phospholipid bilayer that encloses the cell and regulates the movement of substances in and out of the cell. Thus, the cell membrane is not a distinguishing feature.\n\nC. **Chloroplasts**: Chloroplasts are organelles found in plant cells and some algae, where they perform photosynthesis. They are not present in animal cells or prokaryotic cells. Therefore, chloroplasts are a distinguishing feature between prokaryotic and animal cells.\n\nD. **Cell wall**: Prokaryotic cells, such as bacteria, have a cell wall made of peptidoglycan, which provides structural support and protection. Animal cells, on the other hand, do not have a cell wall. Therefore, the presence or absence of a cell wall is a distinguishing feature between prokaryotic and animal cells.\n\nAfter evaluating each option, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Chloroplasts\n\nChloroplasts are unique to plant cells and are absent in both prokaryotic and animal cells, making them a distinguishing feature.",
