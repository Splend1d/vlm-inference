We do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 3.5.\n\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{49}{3.5}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Perform the division**:\n\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{49}{3.5} = 14\n   \\]\n\n4. **Interpret the result**: The value of \\(x\\) is 14, which means John's hourly rate is $14.00.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. $14.00",
