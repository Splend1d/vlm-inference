            "content": "To determine which signs and symptoms are indicative of circulatory overload, we need to understand what circulatory overload entails. Circulatory overload occurs when the heart is unable to pump blood effectively to meet the body's demands, often due to conditions like heart failure or severe hypertension. This can lead to various clinical manifestations.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Hypothermia, hypotension, and bradycardia.\n- Hypothermia and bradycardia are not typical signs of circulatory overload. Hypothermia is a condition of low body temperature, while bradycardia refers to a slow heart rate. These symptoms are more commonly associated with shock or severe hypovolemia.\n\nB. Hypotension, oliguria, and uticaria.\n- Hypotension (low blood pressure) and oliguria (reduced urine output) are indeed indicative of circulatory overload. These symptoms suggest that the heart is not pumping blood effectively, leading to inadequate blood flow to the kidneys and other organs. Uticaria (hives) can also occur due to increased blood pressure and fluid retention.\n\nC. Shivering, pyrexia, and thirst.\n- Shivering and pyrexia (fever) are not typical signs of circulatory overload. These symptoms are more commonly associated with fever or infection. Thirst is a common response to dehydration, which can occur in circulatory overload but is not a direct sign.\n\nD. Dyspnoea, tachycardia, and distended neck veins.\n- Dyspnoea (shortness of breath) and tachycardia (rapid heart rate) are classic signs of circulatory overload. The heart is working harder to pump blood, leading to increased oxygen demand and heart rate. Distended neck veins are a result of increased venous pressure, which occurs when the heart cannot effectively pump blood back to the heart.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct options are B and D. Hypotension, oliguria, and uticaria (B) and dyspnoea, tachycardia, and distended neck veins (D) are indicative signs and symptoms of circulatory overload.",
