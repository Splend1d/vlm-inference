            "content": "To determine the appropriate frequency for assessing wound drainage, we need to consider the nature of wound healing and the potential complications associated with excessive or insufficient drainage.\n\n1. **Understanding Wound Healing**: Wound healing is a complex process that involves inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling. During the inflammatory phase, the body responds to injury by increasing blood flow to the area, which can lead to increased drainage.\n\n2. **Role of Drainage**: Proper drainage is crucial for healing as it helps remove debris, bacteria, and dead tissue. However, excessive drainage can lead to fluid imbalance, which may hinder healing.\n\n3. **Frequency of Assessment**:\n   - **Option A (each time post-operative observations are undertaken)**: This option is too frequent and impractical. It would be burdensome to assess drainage every time a post-operative observation is conducted.\n   - **Option B (daily)**: While daily assessment is better than hourly, it may still be too frequent. The body's response to injury can vary, and daily assessment might not capture changes in drainage that occur over time.\n   - **Option C (every hour)**: Assessing drainage every hour is excessive and impractical. It would be impractical to perform this frequently without causing discomfort to the patient and without providing significant clinical benefit.\n   - **Option D (only when the wound dressing is changed)**: This option is the most appropriate. It allows for assessment only when there is a need to change the dressing, which is typically when the wound is actively healing or when there is a concern about infection. This frequency strikes a balance between monitoring and patient comfort.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The best practice is to assess wound drainage only when the dressing is changed. This approach ensures that the assessment is relevant and timely, providing the necessary information without causing unnecessary discomfort or disruption to the patient's care.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **D. only when the wound dressing is changed**.",
