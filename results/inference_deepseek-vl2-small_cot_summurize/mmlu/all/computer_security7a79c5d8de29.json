            "content": "Authorization aims to accomplish the following:\n\nA. Restrict what operations/data the user can access\n\nAuthorization is a critical component of access control in computer systems. It involves determining what actions a user can perform on a system or its resources, such as files, databases, or network services. This is typically done by verifying the user's identity and then checking their permissions or access rights. If the user is authorized, they can perform the requested action; otherwise, they are denied access.\n\nB. Determine if the user is an attacker\n\nThis is not a primary goal of authorization. While authorization can help prevent unauthorized access, it does not specifically aim to determine if a user is an attacker. Instead, it focuses on ensuring that only authorized users can access certain resources.\n\nC. Flag the user if he/she misbehaves\n\nThis is not a primary goal of authorization. Authorization is about controlling access to resources based on user identity and permissions, not about monitoring user behavior or flagging them for misbehavior.\n\nD. Determine who the user is\n\nThis is a fundamental aspect of authorization, but it is not the primary goal. Authorization is primarily about determining what actions a user can perform based on their identity and permissions, not just identifying who the user is.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. Authorization aims to restrict what operations/data the user can access.",
