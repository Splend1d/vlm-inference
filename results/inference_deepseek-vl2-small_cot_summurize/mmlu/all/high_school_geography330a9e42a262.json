            "content": "To determine the commonality among apartheid, ethnic cleansing, and integration, let's analyze each term:\n\n1. **Apartheid**: This term originated in South Africa and refers to a system of institutionalized racial segregation and discrimination. It was enforced through laws and policies that separated people based on race, leading to significant social and economic disparities.\n\n2. **Ethnic Cleansing**: This term describes the forced removal or killing of ethnic or religious groups from a particular area. It often involves violence and is used to eliminate a group from a region, usually to make way for another ethnic group.\n\n3. **Integration**: This term generally refers to the process of combining different groups into a single community or society. It involves efforts to promote understanding and cooperation among diverse populations.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\nA. **They all occurred in Nazi Germany during World War I.**\n   - This statement is incorrect. Apartheid and ethnic cleansing are not associated with Nazi Germany, and integration is not a concept that emerged during World War I.\n\nB. **They are all forms of residential segregation.**\n   - While apartheid and ethnic cleansing involve residential segregation, integration does not. Integration aims to blend different groups into a single community, not just separate them.\n\nC. **They are all ways to integrate different ethnic populations in neighborhoods.**\n   - This statement is incorrect. Apartheid and ethnic cleansing are not methods of integration; they are forms of separation and discrimination.\n\nD. **They are different expressions for the same concept.**\n   - This statement is correct. While apartheid and ethnic cleansing are distinct concepts, they both involve the separation and discrimination of different groups. Integration, on the other hand, is a process aimed at combining these groups.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. They are different expressions for the same concept.",
