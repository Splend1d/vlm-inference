            "content": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the conditions under which the equations of relativity hold true.\n\n1. **Time Dilation**: According to the theory of relativity, time dilation occurs when an object moves at a significant fraction of the speed of light. This means that time appears to pass more slowly for an observer in motion relative to a stationary observer. The time dilation equation is given by:\n\n   \\[\n   t' = \\frac{t}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\n   \\]\n\n   where \\( t' \\) is the time measured by the moving observer, \\( t \\) is the time measured by the stationary observer, \\( v \\) is the velocity of the moving object, and \\( c \\) is the speed of light.\n\n2. **Length Contraction**: Length contraction is another consequence of relativity, where the length of an object moving at high speed appears shorter to a stationary observer. The length contraction equation is:\n\n   \\[\n   L' = L \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}\n   \\]\n\n   where \\( L' \\) is the length measured by the moving observer, \\( L \\) is the length measured by the stationary observer, and \\( v \\) is the velocity of the moving object.\n\n3. **Momentum**: The relativistic momentum equation is:\n\n   \\[\n   p' = \\frac{m v}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\n   \\]\n\n   where \\( p' \\) is the momentum measured by the moving observer, \\( m \\) is the mass of the object, \\( v \\) is the velocity of the object, and \\( c \\) is the speed of light.\n\nGiven these equations, we can see that they are valid under conditions where the object is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light. This is characteristic of **relativistic speeds**, which are much greater than everyday speeds.\n\n- **Everyday low speeds** (Option A) are not sufficient to cause noticeable effects of relativity, as they are much less than the speed of light.\n- **Relativistic speeds** (Option B) are the speeds at which the effects of relativity, such as time dilation and length contraction, become significant.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. relativistic speeds.",
