            "content": "To determine the behavior of the magnetic field (B) just outside the surface of a superconductor, we need to consider the properties of superconductors and Maxwell's equations.\n\n1. **Understanding Superconductors**: In a superconductor, the electric field (E) is zero, and the magnetic field (B) is expelled from the material. This is due to the Meissner effect, where the superconductor expels magnetic fields from its interior.\n\n2. **Maxwell's Equations**: According to Maxwell's equations, the magnetic field is related to the electric field by the equation:\n   \\[\n   \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B} = \\mu_0 \\mathbf{J} + \\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{E}}{\\partial t}\n   \\]\n   where \\(\\mathbf{J}\\) is the current density, and \\(\\mathbf{E}\\) is the electric field.\n\n3. **Implications for Superconductors**:\n   - Since the electric field (E) is zero inside a superconductor, the term \\(\\mu_0 \\mathbf{J}\\) becomes zero.\n   - The term \\(\\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{E}}{\\partial t}\\) also becomes zero because \\(\\mathbf{E} = 0\\).\n\n4. **Conclusion**: With the electric field being zero inside the superconductor, the only remaining term in the equation is \\(\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B}\\). For this term to be zero, the magnetic field must be tangential to the surface of the superconductor. This is because the curl of a tangential vector field is zero.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. B is tangential to the surface.",
