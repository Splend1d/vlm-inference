            "content": "To understand how the body suppresses the stress response, we need to consider the role of cortisol and the mechanisms that regulate its levels.\n\n1. **Understanding the Stress Response**: When the body perceives a threat, the hypothalamus releases corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF). CRF stimulates the pituitary gland to release adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which in turn stimulates the adrenal glands to release cortisol.\n\n2. **Role of Cortisol**: Cortisol is a glucocorticoid hormone that helps the body respond to stress by increasing blood sugar levels, enhancing the brain's use of glucose, and suppressing the immune system.\n\n3. **Feedback Mechanism**: The body has a feedback mechanism to regulate cortisol levels. When cortisol levels are high, it signals the hypothalamus and pituitary gland to reduce CRF and ACTH production. This is a negative feedback loop, where the presence of high cortisol levels inhibits further production of CRF and ACTH.\n\n4. **Mechanisms of Suppression**:\n   - **A. Constriction of blood flow to the adrenal gland**: This is not a direct mechanism for suppressing cortisol production.\n   - **B. Exhaustion of the body\u2019s store of CRF**: While CRF is involved in the initial stress response, it is not directly involved in the suppression of cortisol production.\n   - **C. Negative feedback loop of cortisol**: This is the correct mechanism. High cortisol levels inhibit further CRF and ACTH release, reducing cortisol production.\n   - **D. Release of CRF-inhibitory factor**: This is not a recognized mechanism in the regulation of cortisol.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **C. Negative feedback loop of cortisol**. This feedback loop ensures that cortisol levels are maintained within a range that is sufficient to respond to stress without causing excessive or prolonged stress responses.",
