These countries have been known for their unique approaches to corporate governance, which have evolved over time. Initially, these countries followed a relationship-based approach, where personal relationships and connections played a significant role in business dealings. This was particularly true in China, where the concept of \"guanxi\" (\u5173\u7cfb) or \"relations\" was crucial in business transactions.\n\nHowever, in recent years, there has been a shift towards a more market-based approach. This means that corporate governance is increasingly being driven by market forces, such as shareholder value, transparency, and accountability. This shift is partly due to the increasing globalization of business and the need for companies to compete on a global scale.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. China, Market, Relationship.",
