            "content": "To determine the frequency of the next higher harmonic, we need to understand the concept of harmonics in a closed pipe. The fundamental frequency of a closed pipe is determined by the length of the pipe and the speed of sound in the air. The formula for the fundamental frequency \\( f_1 \\) of a closed pipe is:\n\n\\[ f_1 = \\frac{1}{4L} \\sqrt{g \\rho} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( L \\) is the length of the pipe,\n- \\( g \\) is the acceleration due to gravity,\n- \\( \\rho \\) is the density of air.\n\nGiven that the fundamental frequency \\( f_1 \\) is 131 Hz, we can use this information to find the length of the pipe. However, for the purpose of finding the next harmonic, we can use the relationship between the fundamental frequency and the harmonic frequencies.\n\nThe general formula for the \\( n \\)-th harmonic frequency \\( f_n \\) of a closed pipe is:\n\n\\[ f_n = n \\times f_1 \\]\n\nFor the next higher harmonic, \\( n = 2 \\):\n\n\\[ f_2 = 2 \\times f_1 = 2 \\times 131 \\, \\text{Hz} = 262 \\, \\text{Hz} \\]\n\nThus, the frequency of the next higher harmonic is 262 Hz.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 262 Hz",
