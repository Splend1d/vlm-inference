DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory).\n\nSRAM (Static Random Access Memory) uses a combination of transistors and capacitors to store data, but it does not use a single transistor and capacitor as its basic memory unit. Instead, it uses a bit cell that consists of a pair of complementary transistors and capacitors.\n\nDRAM, on the other hand, uses a single transistor and a capacitor to store each bit of data. The capacitor is charged to represent a 0, and then discharged to represent a 1. This is known as a \"bit cell\" or \"bit line cell\". The memory array is organized into rows and columns, with each row containing a series of capacitors that are connected to a bit line. The column address is used to select the row, and the bit line is used to read or write the data.\n\nSo, while both SRAM and DRAM use transistors and capacitors, DRAM uses a single transistor and capacitor as its basic memory unit, whereas SRAM uses a pair of complementary transistors and capacitors.",
