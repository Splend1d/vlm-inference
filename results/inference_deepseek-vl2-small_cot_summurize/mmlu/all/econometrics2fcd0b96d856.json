It is specifically designed to check for first-order autocorrelation, which is the simplest form of autocorrelation. It is not suitable for detecting higher-order autocorrelation.\n\nB. **White's test**: This test is used to check for heteroskedasticity, which is a form of autocorrelation in the variance of the residuals. It is not specifically designed to detect autocorrelation up to the third order.\n\nC. **RESET test**: This test is used to check for autocorrelation in the residuals of a regression model. It is particularly useful for detecting higher-order autocorrelation, including up to the third order. The RESET test is a more comprehensive tool for detecting various types of autocorrelation in regression models.\n\nD. **Breusch-Godfrey test**: This test is used to check for autocorrelation in the variance of the residuals in a regression model. It is designed to detect first-order autocorrelation and is not suitable for detecting higher-order autocorrelation.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nC. The RESET test\n\nThe RESET test is specifically designed to check for autocorrelation up to the third order, making it the most appropriate choice for this purpose.",
