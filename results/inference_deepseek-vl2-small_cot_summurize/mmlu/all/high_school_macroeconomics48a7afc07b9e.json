            "content": "To determine what X stands for in the equation GDP = C + I + G + X, we need to understand the components of GDP and the role of each variable.\n\n1. **GDP (Gross Domestic Product)**: This is the total value of all goods and services produced within a country's borders in a specific time period.\n\n2. **C (Consumption)**: This includes all private expenditures by households on goods and services.\n\n3. **I (Investment)**: This includes business investments in capital goods and residential construction, as well as changes in business inventories.\n\n4. **G (Government Spending)**: This includes government expenditures on goods and services.\n\n5. **X (Exports)**: This is the value of goods and services produced domestically and sold to other countries.\n\n6. **M (Imports)**: This is the value of goods and services produced domestically and sold to other countries.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\n- **A. Exports**: Exports are part of GDP, but they are not represented by X in the equation. Exports are added to GDP, not subtracted.\n\n- **B. Expenditures**: Expenditures are part of GDP, but they are not represented by X in the equation. Expenditures are added to GDP, not subtracted.\n\n- **C. Exports minus imports**: This is the correct representation of X. Exports are subtracted from GDP because they are part of the total production but are not included in GDP. Imports are subtracted from GDP because they represent goods and services produced domestically but consumed by foreign entities.\n\n- **D. Imports minus exports**: This is incorrect because it does not accurately represent the role of X in the GDP equation. Imports are subtracted from GDP, not exports.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **C. Exports minus imports**.",
