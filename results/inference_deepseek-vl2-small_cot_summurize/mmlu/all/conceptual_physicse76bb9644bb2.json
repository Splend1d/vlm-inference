It shows the equivalence of mass and energy, specifically in the context of special relativity. Let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **equals mass moving at the speed of light squared.**\n   - This statement is incorrect. The equation \\( E = mc^2 \\) does not imply that energy equals mass moving at the speed of light squared. Instead, it shows that mass and energy are interchangeable under certain conditions, particularly in the context of special relativity.\n\nB. **equals moving mass.**\n   - This statement is also incorrect. The equation \\( E = mc^2 \\) does not imply that energy equals moving mass. It shows that mass and energy are equivalent, not that energy is a form of moving mass.\n\nC. **is fundamentally different than mass.**\n   - This statement is incorrect. The equation \\( E = mc^2 \\) demonstrates that energy and mass are not fundamentally different but are interchangeable. This is a key concept in the theory of relativity.\n\nD. **and mass are closely related.**\n   - This statement is correct. The equation \\( E = mc^2 \\) shows that energy and mass are closely related. When mass is converted into energy, it is given by the equation \\( E = mc^2 \\). This relationship is a cornerstone of Einstein's theory of relativity.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. and mass are closely related.",
