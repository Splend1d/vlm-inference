However, since \\( f \\) maps to the interval \\( (0, 1] \\), it cannot be strictly increasing because it must map some value to 0. Therefore, \\( f \\) must be strictly decreasing.\n\nFor \\( f \\) to be onto, it must map every element in the domain to an element in the range. Since \\( f \\) is strictly decreasing, it maps every element in \\( (0, 1) \\) to a unique element in \\( (0, 1] \\). Thus, \\( f \\) is both one-to-one and onto.\n\n**Conclusion:** Statement I is true.\n\n### Statement II: The image of \\( f \\) is compact.\n\n- The image of \\( f \\) is the set \\( \\{ f(x) : x \\in (0, 1) \\} \\).\n- The interval \\( (0, 1) \\) is compact.\n\nSince \\( f \\) is strictly decreasing and maps every element of \\( (0, 1) \\) to an element in \\( (0, 1] \\), the image of \\( f \\) is a subset of \\( (0, 1] \\). The interval \\( (0, 1] \\) is compact.\n\n**Conclusion:** Statement II is true.\n\n### Statement III: \\( f \\) is continuous, one-to-one, and onto.\n\n- **Continuity:** A function is continuous if it is continuous at every point in its domain. Since \\( f \\) is strictly decreasing, it is continuous everywhere in \\( (0, 1) \\).\n- **One-to-one:** As established, \\( f \\) is one-to-one.\n- **Onto:** As established, \\( f \\) is onto.\n\n**Conclusion:** Statement III is true.\n\nSince all three statements are true, the correct answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{D}\n\\]",
