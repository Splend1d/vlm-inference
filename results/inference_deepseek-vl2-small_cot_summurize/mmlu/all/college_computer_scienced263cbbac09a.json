Since all jobs are equally likely to be executed, the probability of each job being executed is 1/5.\n\nThe expected completion time for each job is:\n\\[ E(T_1) = 25 \\times \\frac{1}{5} = 5 \\]\n\\[ E(T_2) = 15 \\times \\frac{1}{5} = 3 \\]\n\\[ E(T_3) = 5 \\times \\frac{1}{5} = 1 \\]\n\\[ E(T_4) = 3 \\times \\frac{1}{5} = 0.6 \\]\n\\[ E(T_5) = 2 \\times \\frac{1}{5} = 0.4 \\]\n\nThe average completion time is the sum of the expected completion times divided by the number of jobs:\n\\[ \\text{Average completion time} = \\frac{E(T_1) + E(T_2) + E(T_3) + E(T_4) + E(T_5)}{5} = \\frac{5 + 3 + 1 + 0.6 + 0.4}{5} = \\frac{10}{5} = 2 \\]\n\nHowever, this is not one of the options. Let's re-evaluate the problem.\n\nThe correct approach is to find the minimum average completion time by considering the worst-case scenario, where the jobs with the longest service times are executed first.\n\nThe worst-case scenario is:\n\\[ T_1 = 25, T_2 = 15, T_3 = 5, T_4 = 3, T_5 = 2 \\]\n\nThe average completion time in this scenario is:\n\\[ \\text{Average completion time} = \\frac{25 + 15 + 5 + 3 + 2}{5} = \\frac{50}{5} = 10 \\]\n\nHowever, this is still not one of the options.
