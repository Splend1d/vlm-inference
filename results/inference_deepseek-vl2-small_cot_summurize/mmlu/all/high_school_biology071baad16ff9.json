Genetic changes can only occur at the population level.\n- This statement is incorrect. Genetic changes can occur at both the individual and population levels. While populations can experience genetic drift, mutation, and gene flow, individuals can also undergo genetic changes through natural selection, mutation, and genetic recombination.\n\nB. The gene pool in a population remains fixed over time.\n- This statement is incorrect. The gene pool of a population is dynamic and can change over time due to various evolutionary processes such as mutation, gene flow, and natural selection.\n\nC. Natural selection affects individuals, not populations.\n- This statement is incorrect. Natural selection is a process that acts on populations, not individuals. It influences the frequency of alleles in a population, leading to evolutionary changes over time.\n\nD. Individuals cannot evolve, but populations can.\n- This statement is correct. Evolution occurs at the population level, not at the individual level. While individuals can evolve through natural selection, the changes in allele frequencies within a population over time lead to evolutionary change.\n\nTherefore, the best explanation for why a population is described as the evolutionary unit is option D: Individuals cannot evolve, but populations can.",
