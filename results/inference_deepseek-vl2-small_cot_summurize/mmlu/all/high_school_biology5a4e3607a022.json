            "content": "To determine the correct statement, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. The cell dies because it cannot make ATP.\n- Yeast cells can make ATP through both aerobic and anaerobic respiration. In an anaerobic environment, they switch to anaerobic respiration, which is less efficient but still capable of producing ATP. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\nB. The cell would need to consume glucose at a much greater rate because aerobic respiration is much more efficient as compared with anaerobic respiration.\n- While aerobic respiration is more efficient, the need for glucose consumption is not necessarily greater. The efficiency difference is more about the ATP yield per glucose molecule, not the absolute amount needed. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\nC. The cell would need to consume another food source other than glucose because it will not be able to make adequate ATP with only glucose.\n- In an anaerobic environment, yeast cells switch to anaerobic respiration, which is less efficient than aerobic respiration. This means they produce less ATP per glucose molecule, necessitating the consumption of more glucose to meet energy needs. Therefore, this statement is correct.\n\nD. The cell will begin to divide rapidly because larger cells require more oxygen and glucose than smaller ones.\n- The division rate of yeast cells is not directly related to the amount of oxygen or glucose they consume. It is more influenced by environmental conditions and nutrient availability. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the correct statement is:\n\nC. The cell would need to consume another food source other than glucose because it will not be able to make adequate ATP with only glucose.",
