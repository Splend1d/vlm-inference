A group of prime-power order \\( p^n \\) is a cyclic group of order \\( p^n \\). \n\n- A group of prime-power order is always cyclic.\n- A solvable group can have any order, not just prime-power orders.\n\nFor example, consider the group \\( \\mathbb{Z}_4 \\), which is a group of order 4. It is cyclic and of prime-power order, but it is not solvable.\n\nTherefore, the statement is false.\n\n**Statement 2: Every group of prime-power order is solvable.**\n\nA group of prime-power order \\( p^n \\) is a cyclic group of order \\( p^n \\). \n\n- A cyclic group of prime-power order is always solvable.\n\nFor example, consider the group \\( \\mathbb{Z}_4 \\), which is a group of order 4. It is cyclic and of prime-power order, and it is solvable.\n\nTherefore, the statement is true.\n\nGiven the analysis:\n- Statement 1 is false.\n- Statement 2 is true.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nD.
