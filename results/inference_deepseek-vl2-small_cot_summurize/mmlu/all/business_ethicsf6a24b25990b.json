Decision, Market equilibrium, Rationality\n- \"Decision\" is a plausible term for cognitive models, as they often involve making choices.\n- \"Market equilibrium\" is not a term typically associated with cognitive models. It refers to a state where supply equals demand in a market.\n- \"Rationality\" is a common term in cognitive models, as it suggests consumers make decisions based on logical reasoning.\n\nB. Attitudinal, Planned Behaviour, Social pressures\n- \"Attitudinal\" is not a standard term for cognitive models. It might refer to attitudes but is not a direct term for cognitive processes.\n- \"Planned Behaviour\" is a term used in social sciences to describe the process of making decisions, which fits cognitive models.\n- \"Social pressures\" is a term that could be related to cognitive models, as they often consider external influences on decision-making.\n\nC. Decision, Planned behaviour, Rationality\n- \"Decision\" is a term that fits cognitive models, as they involve making choices.\n- \"Planned behaviour\" is a term used in social sciences to describe the process of making decisions, which fits cognitive models.\n- \"Rationality\" is a term commonly used in cognitive models to describe the logical and systematic nature of decision-making.\n\nD. Attitudinal, Market equilibrium, Social pressures\n- \"Attitudinal\" is not a standard term for cognitive models.\n- \"Market equilibrium\" is not a term typically associated with cognitive models.\n- \"Social pressures\" is a term that could be related to cognitive models, as they often consider external influences on decision-making.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the most appropriate choice is C. \"Decision, Planned behaviour, Rationality.\" These terms align well with the context of cognitive models, which aim to explain consumer behavior by considering decision-making processes and the influence of rationality and social factors.",
