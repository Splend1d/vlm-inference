            "content": "A standard GARCH(1,1) model is a type of time-series model used to model the volatility of financial assets. It is particularly useful for capturing the volatility clustering effect, which is the tendency of volatility to remain high for a while after a large movement in the asset's price.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\ni) Fat tails in the return distribution: GARCH models can capture fat tails in the return distribution, which means they can model the probability of extreme returns. This is a common feature of financial data, where extreme events (e.g., market crashes) are more likely than in other types of data.\n\nii) Leverage effects: GARCH models can also capture leverage effects, which are the effects of leverage on volatility. This is because GARCH models can model the conditional variance of the asset's return, which includes the effects of leverage.\n\niii) Volatility clustering: This is a well-known feature of financial data and is one of the main reasons why GARCH models are used. Volatility clustering means that periods of high volatility are followed by periods of low volatility, and vice versa.\n\niv) Volatility affecting returns: This is not a feature that GARCH models can capture. GARCH models are used to model the volatility of returns, not the returns themselves.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. (i), (ii), and (iii) only.",
