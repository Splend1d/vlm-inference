Let him be well versed in the poets, and not less in the orators and historians, and also proficient in writing verse and prose, especially in this vulgar [vernacular] tongue of ours. . . .\nYou must know that I am not content with the Courtier unless he be also a musician and unless, besides understanding and being able to read notes, he can play upon divers instruments. . . .\nI wish our Courtier to guard against getting the name of a liar or a boaster, which sometimes befalls even those who do not deserve it.\n\u2014From Baldassare Castiglione's Book of the Courtier, 1528\nWhich of the following skills that Castiglione recommends for a courtier would be valued LEAST by a European gentleman at the end of the twentieth century?\n\nA.

            "content": "To answer this question, we need to consider the context of the time period in which Castiglione wrote his book, the end of the fifteenth century. At that time, Europe was a continent of largely rural and agrarian societies, with a strong emphasis on agriculture, hunting, and warfare. The skills that Castiglione recommends for a courtier, such as expertise with multiple languages, being strong and attractive, and expertise with many kinds of weapons, would have been highly valued by European gentlemen at the end of the twentieth century.\n\nHowever, the ability to write poetry and prose, especially in the vernacular tongue, would have been valued LESS by a European gentleman at the end of the twentieth century. This is because, by the end of the twentieth century, Europe had become a highly urbanized and industrialized continent, with a strong emphasis on technology, science, and the arts. The ability to write poetry and prose in the vernacular tongue would have been seen as a more traditional and less relevant skill in this context.\n\nTherefore, the skill that Castiglione recommends for a courtier that would be valued LEAST by a European gentleman at the end of the twentieth century is:\n\nD. Ability to write poetry and prose",
