            "content": "The correct answer is A. Near-Earth asteroids gradually disintegrate and spread out along their orbital path. When the Earth passes through the orbit of an asteroid we are bombarded by sand-sized particles which cause a meteor shower.\n\nExplanation:\n\n- **Option A** is correct because it accurately describes the process of meteor showers. Near-Earth asteroids, which are small, rocky objects that orbit the Sun, gradually disintegrate due to the effects of solar radiation and other environmental factors. As these asteroids break apart, they release a stream of small particles, often referred to as meteoroids, into space. When the Earth passes through this stream of particles, the particles enter the Earth's atmosphere and burn up, creating a meteor shower. The bright streaks of light that we see in the sky during a meteor shower are the result of these particles burning up and producing light.\n\n- **Option B** is incorrect because it describes the process of meteor showers, but it incorrectly attributes the source of the meteoroids to the disintegration of near-Earth asteroids. In reality, meteoroids are primarily composed of dust and small rocks, not the larger, more solid pieces of asteroids.\n\n- **Option C** is incorrect because it describes the process of meteor showers, but it incorrectly attributes the source of the meteoroids to the disintegration of comets. Comets are icy bodies that release gas and dust as they approach the Sun, but the meteoroids that cause meteor showers are primarily from asteroids.\n\n- **Option D** is incorrect because it describes the process of meteor showers, but it incorrectly attributes the source of the meteoroids to the disintegration of comets. As explained, the meteoroids that cause meteor showers are primarily from asteroids, not comets.",
