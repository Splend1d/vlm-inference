The British introduced English as the language of administration, education, and communication. This was not a voluntary adoption but rather a imposition by the British, who used English to exert control over the Indian population. The British were in a position of power and influence, and they used this to spread English as a means of maintaining their dominance.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Hierarchal\n\nThe British used their hierarchical position to impose English on the Indian population, leading to its widespread use and acceptance in various aspects of life.",
