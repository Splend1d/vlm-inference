            "content": "To solve the problem, we need to determine how many parts the worker can produce in 35 hours, given that she produces 22 parts in 7 hours.\n\nFirst, we calculate the rate at which the worker produces parts per hour. The worker produces 22 parts in 7 hours. Therefore, the rate is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Rate} = \\frac{22 \\text{ parts}}{7 \\text{ hours}} = \\frac{22}{7} \\text{ parts per hour}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many parts the worker can produce in 35 hours. We do this by multiplying the rate by the number of hours:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total parts} = \\text{Rate} \\times \\text{Hours} = \\frac{22}{7} \\times 35\n\\]\n\nTo simplify the multiplication, we can convert 35 to a fraction with a denominator of 7:\n\n\\[\n35 = \\frac{35 \\times 7}{7} = \\frac{245}{7}\n\\]\n\nNow, we multiply the rate by this fraction:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total parts} = \\frac{22}{7} \\times \\frac{245}{7} = \\frac{22 \\times 245}{7 \\times 7} = \\frac{5390}{49}\n\\]\n\nWe can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5390}{49} = 110\n\\]\n\nThus, the worker can produce 110 parts in 35 hours. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{D}\n\\]",
