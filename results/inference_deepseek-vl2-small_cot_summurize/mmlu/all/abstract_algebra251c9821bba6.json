Therefore, a maximal ideal is a prime ideal.\n\nThus, Statement 1 is true.\n\n**Statement 2: If \\( I \\) is a maximal ideal of a commutative ring \\( R \\), then \\( R/I \\) is a field.**\n\n- If \\( I \\) is a maximal ideal of \\( R \\), then \\( R/I \\) is a quotient ring of \\( R \\).\n- For \\( R/I \\) to be a field, it must be a commutative ring with no zero divisors.\n- However, the quotient ring \\( R/I \\) may not necessarily be a field. For example, consider the ring \\( \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\) with the ideal \\( I = 2\\mathbb{Z} \\). The quotient ring \\( \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\) is a field, but if we consider the ideal \\( I = 3\\mathbb{Z} \\), the quotient ring \\( \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\) is not a field because it has zero divisors.\n\nThus, Statement 2 is false.\n\nGiven the analysis:\n- Statement 1 is true.\n- Statement 2 is false.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nC.
