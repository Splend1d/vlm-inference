            "content": "To determine which pair of liquids is expected to be immiscible, we need to consider the nature of the liquids and their interactions. Immiscibility occurs when two liquids do not mix and remain separate, often due to differences in polarity, molecular size, or intermolecular forces.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **H2O and CH3OH (Methanol)**\n   - **Polarity**: Water (H2O) is a polar molecule due to the electronegativity difference between hydrogen and oxygen, while methanol (CH3OH) is also polar but with a different polarity compared to water.\n   - **Intermolecular Forces**: Both water and methanol have hydrogen bonding capabilities, but the strength and type of these interactions differ.\n   - **Conclusion**: Although they are both polar, the differences in polarity and intermolecular forces make them miscible rather than immiscible.\n\nB. **C6H6 (Benzene) and C5H12 (Pentane)**\n   - **Polarity**: Benzene is a nonpolar molecule, while pentane is a nonpolar hydrocarbon.\n   - **Intermolecular Forces**: Both are nonpolar, and their interactions are primarily van der Waals forces.\n   - **Conclusion**: Since both are nonpolar, they are miscible.\n\nC. **C10H22 (Decane) and CH2CH2CH2OH (Ethanol)**\n   - **Polarity**: Decane is a nonpolar hydrocarbon, while ethanol is a polar alcohol.\n   - **Intermolecular Forces**: Decane has only van der Waals forces, while ethanol has hydrogen bonding.\n   - **Conclusion**: The difference in polarity and the presence of hydrogen bonding make them immiscible.\n\nD. **CH3CH2NH2 (Ethylamine) and CH3CH2CH2OH (Butanol)**\n   - **Polarity**: Ethylamine is a polar amine, while butanol is a polar alcohol.\n   - **Intermolecular Forces**: Both have hydrogen bonding capabilities.\n   - **Conclusion**: The presence of hydrogen bonding makes them miscible.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the pair of liquids expected to be immiscible is:\n\nC.
