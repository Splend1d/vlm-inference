            "content": "A common nuclear fission reactor is designed to generate electricity directly. Here's a brief explanation of each option:\n\nA. **Heats water**: While nuclear reactors do heat water, this is not the primary function of a fission reactor. The heat generated is used to produce steam, which drives turbines to generate electricity.\n\nB. **Generates electricity directly**: This is the correct answer. Nuclear fission reactors use the heat generated from the splitting of atomic nuclei to produce steam. This steam drives turbines connected to generators, which produce electricity.\n\nC. **Gets energy from nothing**: This statement is misleading. Nuclear fission reactors do not \"get energy from nothing.\" They use nuclear fuel (such as uranium-235) that has been enriched and is in a stable state. When the fuel is split, it releases a large amount of energy, which is then harnessed to generate electricity.\n\nD. **Is a major polluter of the atmosphere**: This statement is incorrect. Nuclear fission reactors do not emit greenhouse gases or other pollutants into the atmosphere. In fact, they are considered a cleaner source of energy compared to fossil fuels, as they do not produce air pollution or carbon emissions.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. generates electricity directly**.",
