Let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Na2SO4 + Ba(NO3)2 \u2192 BaSO4 + NaSO4\n- Sodium (Na) and Sulfate (SO4) are balanced on both sides.\n- Barium (Ba) and Nitrate (NO3) are balanced on both sides.\n- Sulfur (S) and Oxygen (O) are balanced on both sides.\n- Total atoms: 2 Na, 1 Ba, 4 S, 8 O, 2 N, 4 O.\n- This reaction is balanced.\n\nB. AgNO3 + K2CrO4 \u2192 Ag2CrO4 + 2 KNO3\n- Silver (Ag) and Nitrate (NO3) are balanced on both sides.\n- Potassium (K) and Chromate (CrO4) are balanced on both sides.\n- Oxygen (O) is balanced on both sides.\n- Total atoms: 2 Ag, 2 K, 2 Cr, 8 O, 2 N, 4 O.\n- This reaction is balanced.\n\nC. 5 FeCl2 + 8 HCl + KMnO4 \u2192 5 FeCl3 + MnCl2 + 4 H2O + KCl\n- Iron (Fe) and Chloride (Cl) are balanced on both sides.\n- Hydrogen (H) and Chloride (Cl) are balanced on both sides.\n- Manganese (Mn) and Chloride (Cl) are balanced on both sides.\n- Oxygen (O) is balanced on both sides.\n- Total atoms: 5 Fe, 16 H, 10 Cl, 1 Mn, 4 O, 1 K.\n- This reaction is balanced.\n\nD. Al(NO3)3 + 3 KOH \u2192 Al(OH)3 + KNO3\n- Aluminum (Al) and Nitrate (NO3) are balanced on both sides.\n- Potassium (K) and Hydroxide (OH) are balanced on both sides.\n- Oxygen (O) is balanced on both sides.\n- Total atoms: 1 Al, 3 K, 3 OH, 1 Al, 1 K, 1 O.\n- This reaction is balanced.\n\nAfter analyzing all the options, we find that all of them are balanced.
