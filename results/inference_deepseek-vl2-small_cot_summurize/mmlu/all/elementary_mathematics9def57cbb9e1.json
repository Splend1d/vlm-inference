This equation is asking us to find out how many times 14 can fit into 42.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n14 \u00d7 3 = 42\n\nThis means that if you have 14 items and you want to know how many times you can fit 3 of those items into 42, the answer is 42.\n\nSo, the correct statement that correctly interprets the expression is:\n\nC. 14 is 3 times as many as 42.\n\nThis means that 14 is three times the number of 42.",
