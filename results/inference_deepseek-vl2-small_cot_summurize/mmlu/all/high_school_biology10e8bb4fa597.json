Connective tissue is a group of tissues that support, bind, and protect other tissues and organs in the body. It is composed of cells, fibers, and a matrix.\n\nA. **Ligaments**: Ligaments are connective tissues that connect bones to other bones, providing stability and support to joints. They are composed of dense regular connective tissue, which consists of tightly packed collagen fibers.\n\nB. **Muscle**: Muscles are also connective tissues, but they are specifically muscle tissue. They are composed of muscle fibers, which are long, cylindrical cells that contract to produce movement.\n\nC. **Blood**: Blood is not a connective tissue; it is a fluid connective tissue. It is composed of cells suspended in a liquid matrix, which is plasma. Blood serves as a transport medium for nutrients, gases, and waste products throughout the body.\n\nD. **Cartilage**: Cartilage is a type of connective tissue that provides support and flexibility to various parts of the body, such as the ears, nose, and joints. It is composed of chondrocytes (cartilage cells) embedded in a matrix of collagen fibers.\n\nGiven this information, the correct answer is C. Blood, as it is not a connective tissue but a fluid connective tissue.",
