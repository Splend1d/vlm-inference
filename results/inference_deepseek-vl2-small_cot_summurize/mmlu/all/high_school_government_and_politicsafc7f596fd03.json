            "content": "To determine which option is an example of \"horse-race journalism,\" we need to understand what this term means. \"Horse-race journalism\" refers to a style of reporting that focuses on the competition and drama of a political race, often emphasizing who is ahead or behind rather than the issues or policies. This type of journalism is characterized by a focus on the horse race itself, with less attention to the substance of the issues.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. A news story focuses on a politician's scandals rather than achievements.\n- This option is more about highlighting negative aspects of a politician, which could be considered investigative journalism, not horse-race journalism.\n\nB. A television news anchor reports an event before the station's rivals.\n- This is more about the timing and urgency of the news, which is not specifically about the competition between candidates.\n\nC. A reporter announces which candidate leads in a public opinion poll.\n- This is a classic example of horse-race journalism. It focuses on the competition between candidates by highlighting who is leading in the polls, which is a measure of popularity rather than policy or substance.\n\nD. A newspaper editor prints stories about long-term political developments.\n- This option is more about providing context and background information, which is not focused on the competition between candidates.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the correct answer is C. A reporter announces which candidate leads in a public opinion poll. This directly aligns with the definition of horse-race journalism, as it emphasizes the competition and popularity of candidates rather than the issues they are addressing.",
