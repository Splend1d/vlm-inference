            "content": "To determine which fact was established before 1859, we need to consider the historical context and the timeline of scientific discoveries.\n\nA. DNA provides the macromolecular basis of heredity.\n- This fact was established in the 20th century, specifically in 1944 by Oswald Avery, Colin MacLeod, and Maclyn McCarty, who demonstrated that DNA is the genetic material.\n\nB. Mendelian principles explain why some traits are dominant and others are recessive.\n- Gregor Mendel's work on inheritance, which laid the foundation for Mendelian genetics, was published in 1866. This was after 1859.\n\nC. Prokaryotes include two major domains, the Bacteria and the Archaea.\n- The discovery of prokaryotes and their classification into Bacteria and Archaea was made in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The first major classification of prokaryotes was done by Carl Woese in 1977.\n\nD. There exist fossilized remains of species that have become extinct.\n- Fossil records have been known for centuries, with the earliest evidence dating back to the 17th century. However, the concept of extinction and the existence of extinct species was not fully understood until the 19th century.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nD. There exist fossilized remains of species that have become extinct.\n\nThis fact was established prior to 1859, as fossil records have been known for centuries, and the concept of extinction was not fully understood until the 19th century.",
