            "content": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Auxins: These are plant hormones that play a crucial role in various growth processes in plants, such as cell elongation and differentiation. They are not typically associated with eliciting responses in other members of the same species.\n\nB. Hormones: Hormones are chemical messengers produced by glands in the endocrine system. They are released into the bloodstream and travel to target organs or tissues, where they exert their effects. Hormones are known for their role in regulating a wide range of physiological processes, including metabolism, growth, and reproduction. They can elicit responses in other members of the same species, such as influencing behavior or physiological responses.\n\nC. Pheromones: These are chemical signals that are released by an organism to communicate with members of the same species. They are often used for mating, territorial marking, or other social behaviors. While pheromones can elicit responses in other members of the same species, they are not typically considered a broad category of chemical substances released by organisms.\n\nD. Enzymes: Enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions in the body. They are not chemical substances released by organisms to elicit responses in other members of the same species.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is B. Hormones, as they are the chemical substances released by organisms that elicit a physiological or behavioral response in other members of the same species.",
