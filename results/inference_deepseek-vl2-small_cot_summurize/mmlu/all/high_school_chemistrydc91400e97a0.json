The samples were titrated with standard potassium hydroxide, KOH, solution. Cresol red was the acid-base indicator used in the titration. The samples required 31.75, 32.38, and 41.75 mL to reach the endpoint. Which of the following might explain why one of the samples required significantly more base to reach the endpoint?\n\nA. The indicator was added too late.\nB. The wrong indicator was used.\nC. There was a base contaminating the unclean beaker.\nD. There was an acid contaminating the unclean beaker.\n",

            "content": "To determine why one of the samples required significantly more base to reach the endpoint, we need to consider the factors that could affect the titration process.\n\n1. **Indicator Addition**: The indicator, cresol red, is added to the solution to signal the endpoint of the titration. If the indicator is added too late, the solution may not have reached the endpoint when the indicator is added, leading to a higher volume of base required to reach the endpoint.\n\n2. **Indicator Type**: The choice of indicator can affect the titration. Cresol red is a weak acid-base indicator, and its effectiveness can vary depending on the pH range of the solution. If the pH of the solution is not within the range where cresol red is effective, the titration may not be accurate.\n\n3. **Contamination**: If there is a base contaminating the unclean beaker, it could react with the phenol, altering the pH of the solution and requiring more base to reach the endpoint. Conversely, if there is an acid contaminating the unclean beaker, it could react with the phenol, also altering the pH and requiring more base.\n\n4. **Sample Purity**: If the samples are not pure, there could be impurities that react with the base or the indicator, affecting the titration.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most likely explanation for the sample requiring significantly more base is:\n\nA. The indicator was added too late.\n\nThis option directly addresses the possibility that the indicator was not added at the correct time, leading to an inaccurate endpoint and thus requiring more base to reach it.",
