In this scenario, there is no parasite-host relationship, so parasitism is not applicable.\n\nB. **Commensalism**: This is a relationship where one organism benefits while the other is neither helped nor harmed. The scenario describes trees competing for the same resources, which is not a commensal relationship.\n\nC. **Natural selection**: This is the process by which organisms better adapted to their environment tend to survive and produce more offspring. The scenario does not involve adaptation or differential survival and reproduction, so natural selection is not the correct answer.\n\nD. **Intraspecific competition**: This occurs when individuals of the same species compete for the same resources. In the scenario, two trees of the same species compete for light, water, and nutrients, which is a classic example of intraspecific competition.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.
