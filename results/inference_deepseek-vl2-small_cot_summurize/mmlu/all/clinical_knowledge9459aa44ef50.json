            "content": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **via protein transporters called GLUT4.**\n   - Glucose transport into muscle cells is primarily facilitated by the translocation of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) to the cell membrane. This process is triggered by insulin, which binds to receptors on the cell surface, activating a signaling cascade that leads to the insertion of GLUT4 into the membrane. This allows glucose to be taken up into the cell. Therefore, this option is correct.\n\nB. **only in the presence of insulin.**\n   - While insulin is crucial for the translocation of GLUT4 to the cell membrane, it is not the only factor. Other hormones, such as glucagon, can also influence glucose uptake by affecting the activity of GLUT4. Thus, this option is incorrect.\n\nC. **via hexokinase.**\n   - Hexokinase is an enzyme that catalyzes the phosphorylation of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate, a step necessary for glucose uptake. However, it does not transport glucose into the cell. Instead, it is involved in the initial step of glucose metabolism. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\nD. **via monocarbylic acid transporters.**\n   - Monocarbylic acid transporters are involved in the transport of monocarboxylic acids, not glucose. Glucose transport is not mediated by these transporters. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\nAfter evaluating each option, the correct answer is:\n\nA. via protein transporters called GLUT4.",
