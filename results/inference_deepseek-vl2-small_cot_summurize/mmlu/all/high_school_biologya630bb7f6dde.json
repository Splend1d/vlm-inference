Plants of the same genetic variety have flowers that range in color from blue to pink with the color varying due to the type of soil in which they are grown. Which of the following statement best explains this phenomenon?\n\nA. The alleles for flower color show incomplete dominance where neither trait is dominant; expression of the genes shows a blending of traits.\nB. The alleles for flower color are codominant; both traits show depending on the environment.\nC. In this case, the environment alters the expression of a trait.\nD. The genes for flower color show polygenic inheritance.\n",

            "content": "To determine the correct explanation for the variation in flower color of hydrangea plants, we need to analyze the genetic and environmental factors involved.\n\n- **Option A: Incomplete Dominance**\n  - Incomplete dominance occurs when neither allele is dominant over the other, resulting in a blend of traits. This would typically result in a intermediate color, such as lavender, rather than the distinct blue and pink colors observed in hydrangeas.\n\n- **Option B: Codominance**\n  - Codominance occurs when both alleles are fully expressed, resulting in a phenotype that is a combination of both traits. This would also not account for the distinct blue and pink colors, as both traits would be equally expressed.\n\n- **Option C: Environmental Influence**\n  - This option suggests that the environment, specifically the type of soil, alters the expression of the flower color gene. Hydrangeas are known to be sensitive to soil pH, which affects the availability of aluminum ions. In acidic soils, aluminum is more available, leading to blue flowers, while in alkaline soils, aluminum is less available, resulting in pink flowers. This environmental influence is a classic example of how a single gene can exhibit different phenotypes based on environmental conditions.\n\n- **Option D: Polygenic Inheritance**\n  - Polygenic inheritance involves multiple genes contributing to a single trait, resulting in a continuous range of phenotypes. While this can explain variations in flower color, it does not account for the distinct blue and pink colors observed in hydrangeas, which are more indicative of a single gene with environmental influence.\n\nConsidering the above analysis, the best explanation for the variation in flower color of hydrangea plants is **Option C: In this case, the environment alters the expression of a trait.** This is because the color of the flowers is determined by the soil pH, which in turn affects the availability of aluminum ions, thus altering the expression of the flower color gene.",
