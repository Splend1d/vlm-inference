It is possible that this figure refers to a specific region or country, but it does not align with the global statistics.\n   - **Option B (14 million)**: This is a plausible figure, but it is still lower than the global estimates. It could be a regional estimate, but it does not match the global numbers.\n   - **Option C (42 million)**: This is a more reasonable estimate, but it is still lower than the global numbers. It could be a regional estimate, but it does not match the global numbers.\n   - **Option D (124 million)**: This is the highest number among the options. It aligns with the global estimates provided by the WHO and other health organizations.\n\n3. **Global Statistics**:\n   - According to the WHO, as of 2020, there were approximately 38 million people living with HIV/AIDS globally. This number includes both adults and children.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The global estimate of 124 million people infected by HIV/AIDS as of 2020 is the most accurate and aligns with the information provided by the WHO and other health organizations.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 124 million",
