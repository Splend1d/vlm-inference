            "content": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. mtDNA mutates at a slower rate than nuclear DNA.\n- This statement is incorrect. Mitochondrial DNA mutates at a faster rate than nuclear DNA. This is because mtDNA is not subject to the same repair mechanisms as nuclear DNA, which can lead to higher mutation rates.\n\nB. mtDNA is passed from mother to child and is free from recombination that occurs between pairs of chromosomes.\n- This statement is correct. Mitochondrial DNA is inherited maternally, meaning it is passed from mother to child without recombination. This allows geneticists to trace maternal lineages and study the evolutionary history of populations.\n\nC. There are few single nucleotide polymorphisms in the hypervariable, noncoding regions.\n- This statement is incorrect. Mitochondrial DNA is rich in single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the hypervariable regions, which are highly variable and useful for studying population genetics and evolutionary relationships.\n\nD. All mitochondrial proteins are coded for by mitochondrial genes.\n- This statement is incorrect. Mitochondrial proteins are encoded by both mitochondrial and nuclear genes. The mitochondrial genome contains its own set of genes, but it also contains genes that are transcribed into mitochondrial proteins.\n\nAfter evaluating each option, the correct answer is B. mtDNA is passed from mother to child and is free from recombination that occurs between pairs of chromosomes. This characteristic makes mtDNA a valuable tool for studying the relatedness of animal populations.",
