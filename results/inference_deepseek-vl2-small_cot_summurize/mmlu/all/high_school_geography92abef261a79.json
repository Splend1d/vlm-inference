World cities contain the headquarters of many transnational corporations.\n- This statement is true. World cities often serve as the headquarters for major transnational corporations due to their economic influence, strategic location, and infrastructure.\n\nB. World cities are well connected to secondary-level world cities.\n- This statement is also true. World cities are typically hubs for international trade and communication, making them well-connected to secondary-level world cities, which are important regional centers.\n\nC. World cities contain many offices of multinational organizations.\n- This statement is true. World cities often host the offices of multinational organizations, which are crucial for global operations and decision-making.\n\nD.
