            "content": "To determine which of the options is a detritivore, we need to understand what a detritivore is. Detritivores are organisms that feed on dead organic matter, such as decaying plants and animals. They play a crucial role in the ecosystem by breaking down dead material and recycling nutrients back into the environment.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Cactus - Cacti are plants that store water in their thick, fleshy tissues. They are not detritivores because they do not feed on dead organic matter. Instead, they obtain nutrients from the soil.\n\nB. Algae - Algae are simple, plant-like organisms that can live in water or on land. They are not detritivores because they do not feed on dead organic matter. Algae are typically primary producers, converting sunlight into energy through photosynthesis.\n\nC. Bat - Bats are mammals that feed on insects and other small animals. They are not detritivores because they do not feed on dead organic matter. Bats are carnivores or insectivores.\n\nD. Fungus - Fungi are a diverse group of organisms that include yeasts, molds, and mushrooms. Many fungi are detritivores because they feed on dead organic matter, such as decaying wood, leaves, and other plant material. They play a vital role in breaking down organic matter and recycling nutrients in the ecosystem.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is D. Fungus.",
