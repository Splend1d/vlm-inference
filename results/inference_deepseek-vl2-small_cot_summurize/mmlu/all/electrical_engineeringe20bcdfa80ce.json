Zinc silicate**: Zinc silicate is a group of minerals that includes zinc oxide (ZnO), which is known for its white color when in its pure form. It does not exhibit red fluorescence.\n\n- **B. Calcium silicate**: Calcium silicate is another group of minerals that includes calcite (CaCO\u2083). Calcite is typically white or off-white and does not exhibit red fluorescence.\n\n- **C. Zinc sulphide**: Zinc sulphide (ZnS) is a compound that can exhibit red fluorescence. When it absorbs light, it emits light in the red part of the spectrum, which is why it is often used in red light-emitting diodes (LEDs).\n\n- **D. Magnesium silicate**: Magnesium silicate includes minerals like talc and serpentine. These minerals are typically white or light-colored and do not exhibit red fluorescence.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is **C. Zinc sulphide**. Zinc sulphide is the fluorescent material that gives red color fluorescence.",
