While it is important for moral development, it does not directly relate to the extent of control an individual feels over their life.\n\nB. **Personal integrity**: This involves being true to oneself and one's values. It is a personal trait that can influence how one perceives their control over life, but it is not the primary determinant.\n\nC. **Cognitive moral development**: This is the process by which individuals develop a sense of right and wrong and understand the consequences of their actions. It is a part of moral growth but does not specifically address the extent of control over life.\n\nD. **Locus of control**: This concept, introduced by Julian Rotter, refers to the extent to which individuals believe they have control over the events in their lives. People with a high locus of control believe they can influence the outcomes of their actions, while those with a low locus of control feel that events are largely outside their control.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Locus of control\n\nThe extent to which an individual believes they can control their life is determined by their locus of control.",
