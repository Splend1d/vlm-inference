            "content": "To find the concentration of BrCl at equilibrium, we first need to determine the number of moles of BrCl initially present. The molar mass of BrCl is 159.8 g/mol.\n\n1. Calculate the number of moles of BrCl initially present:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Moles of BrCl} = \\frac{\\text{mass of BrCl}}{\\text{molar mass of BrCl}} = \\frac{10.0 \\, \\text{g}}{159.8 \\, \\text{g/mol}} \\approx 0.0627 \\, \\text{mol}\n   \\]\n\n2. Use the equilibrium constant expression to find the concentration of BrCl at equilibrium:\n\n   \\[\n   K_c = \\frac{[\\text{BrCl}]^2}{[\\text{Br}_2][\\text{Cl}_2]}\n   \\]\n\n   At equilibrium, \\([\\text{Br}_2] = [\\text{Cl}_2] = x\\) and \\([\\text{BrCl}] = y\\).\n\n   \\[\n   15.0 = \\frac{y^2}{x^2}\n   \\]\n\n3. Since the reaction vessel is 15.0 liters, the concentration of Br2 and Cl2 at equilibrium is \\(x = \\frac{0.0627}{15.0} = 0.00418 \\, \\text{mol/L}\\).\n\n4. Substitute \\(x\\) into the equilibrium constant expression:\n\n   \\[\n   15.0 = \\frac{y^2}{(0.00418)^2}\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   15.0 = \\frac{y^2}{0.0000175}\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   y^2 = 15.0 \\times 0.0000175 = 0.002625\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   y = \\sqrt{0.002625} \\approx 0.0512 \\, \\text{mol/L}\n   \\]\n\n5. The concentration of BrCl at equilibrium is approximately 5.77 \u00d7 10^-3 mol/L.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 5.77 \u00d7 10^-3 mol/L.",
