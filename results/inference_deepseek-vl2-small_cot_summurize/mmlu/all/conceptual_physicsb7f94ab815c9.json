            "content": "When a uranium nucleus undergoes fission, the energy released is primarily in the form of kinetic energy of the fission fragments. This is because the fission process involves the splitting of a heavy nucleus into two or more lighter nuclei, along with the release of a large amount of energy. The energy released is primarily in the form of kinetic energy of the fission fragments, which are the two or more lighter nuclei that result from the fission process.\n\nGamma radiation is also released during fission, but it is not the primary form of energy released. Ejected neutrons can also carry away some of the energy, but they are not the primary form of energy released.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. kinetic energy of fission fragments.",
