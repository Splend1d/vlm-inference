            "content": "To determine which substance is a primary standard for standardizing bases, we need to understand the concept of primary standards. Primary standards are substances that are used to calibrate other standards and are themselves of very high purity. They are used to establish the concentration of a solution by reacting with it to form a precipitate or a color change.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Ammonium hydroxide (NH\u2084OH) is a primary standard for standardizing bases. It is used to calibrate the concentration of bases like sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and potassium hydroxide (KOH). When ammonium hydroxide is added to a solution containing a base, it reacts to form a precipitate of ammonium hydroxide, which can be easily weighed and used to determine the concentration of the base in the original solution.\n\nB. Sulfuric acid (H\u2082SO\u2084) is not a primary standard for standardizing bases. It is used as a secondary standard for titrations and is not involved in the calibration of bases.\n\nC. Acetic acid (CH\u2083COOH) is not a primary standard for standardizing bases. It is used in titrations and is not involved in the calibration of bases.\n\nD. Potassium hydrogen phthalate (KHP) is a primary standard for standardizing bases. It is used to calibrate the concentration of bases like sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide. When KHP is added to a solution containing a base, it reacts to form a precipitate of potassium hydrogen phthalate, which can be weighed and used to determine the concentration of the base in the original solution.\n\nBoth A and D are primary standards for standardizing bases. However, since the question asks for a single answer, we can choose either A or D.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Ammonium hydroxide\n\nD. Potassium hydrogen phthalate",
