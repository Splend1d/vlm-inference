The only force acting on the ball is gravity, which is constant and acts downward.\n\nAt the 10-m position, the ball is halfway up to its maximum height of 20 m. This means that the ball has already overcome the force of gravity to reach this height. At this point, the net force on the ball is zero because the upward force of gravity is equal to the downward force of gravity.\n\nTherefore, the net force on the ball at the 10-m position is zero, and the correct answer is:\n\nB. mg",
