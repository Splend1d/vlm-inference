The probability that the estimate is a long way away from its true value is minimised.\n- This statement is true. An estimator with minimum variance aims to minimize the probability that the estimate deviates significantly from the true value. This is a fundamental property of minimum variance estimators, as they are designed to provide estimates that are close to the true value.\n\nB. The estimator is efficient.\n- This statement is also true. An efficient estimator is one that provides the smallest possible variance for a given level of accuracy. Therefore, an estimator with minimum variance is indeed efficient.\n\nC. Such an estimator would be termed \"best\".\n- This statement is true. In the context of estimation theory, an estimator with minimum variance is often considered the \"best\" estimator because it provides the most accurate estimate with the least amount of variability.\n\nD. Such an estimator will always be unbiased.\n- This statement is NOT implied. An estimator with minimum variance is not necessarily unbiased. While it is true that unbiased estimators are efficient, an estimator can be efficient without being unbiased. For example, a biased estimator can have minimum variance if it is designed to be unbiased in a specific way.\n\nTherefore, the statement that is NOT implied by an estimator having minimum variance is:\n\nD. Such an estimator will always be unbiased.",
