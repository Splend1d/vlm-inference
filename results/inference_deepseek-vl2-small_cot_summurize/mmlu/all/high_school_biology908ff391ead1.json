            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and how it applies to autosomal recessive traits.\n\n1. **Understanding the Population**: The autosomal recessive trait is expressed in 1% of the population. This means that 1 out of every 100 individuals in the population expresses the trait.\n\n2. **Carrier Frequency**: In autosomal recessive inheritance, the trait is recessive, meaning that an individual must inherit two copies of the recessive allele (one from each parent) to express the trait. Therefore, the carrier frequency is 1/2, or 50%, because half of the population must carry one recessive allele to potentially pass it on to their offspring.\n\n3. **Carriers Who Do Not Express the Trait**: Since the trait is recessive, individuals who are carriers (heterozygous) do not express the trait. Therefore, the percentage of the population that are carriers but do not express the trait is the same as the carrier frequency.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Given that the carrier frequency is 50%, the percentage of the population that are carriers but do not express the trait is also 50%.\n\nThus, the correct answer is D. 50%.",
