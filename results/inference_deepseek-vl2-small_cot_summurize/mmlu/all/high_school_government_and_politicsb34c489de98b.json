College attendance in a state other than one's home state: This can contribute to lower voting rates because young people may not have a strong connection to the state where they are attending college. They may not feel a sense of responsibility or obligation to vote in that state, especially if they are not registered there.\n\nB. Frequent relocation of one's primary residence: This can also contribute to lower voting rates because young people may not have a stable address or may not feel a strong connection to the state or locality where they are currently living. This can make it difficult for them to register to vote or to feel motivated to vote.\n\nC. The remoteness of most political issues to the daily lives of young people: This can contribute to lower voting rates because young people may not see the relevance of politics to their daily lives. They may not feel that their vote will make a difference or that the issues that are most important to them are being addressed by the political system.\n\nD. The fact that the minimum voting age in some states is 21: This does not contribute to lower voting rates among Americans in the 18-to-25 age bracket. In fact, it may contribute to higher voting rates because young people who are 18 or 19 may be more likely to vote if they are allowed to do so.\n\nTherefore, the option that does not contribute to lower voting rates among Americans in the 18-to-25 age bracket is D. The fact that the minimum voting age in some states is 21.",
