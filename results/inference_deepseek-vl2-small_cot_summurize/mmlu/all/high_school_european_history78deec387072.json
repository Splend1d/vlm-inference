And now he was going to deprive the poor soldier, who had undergone so many hardships, and suffered from innumerable wounds, of this small remuneration, and not even allow him a pretty Indian female for a companion&\u2026\n[Later], when Cort\u00e9s learnt that there were still a great many bars of gold among the men, and heavy gambling in consequence, (for, according to the old saying, gold and love cannot lie long concealed,) he made known, under threats of severe punishment, that everyone should produce the gold he had obtained on the night of our retreat, of which one third was to be returned to him; but that anyone who refused to pay this, should have the whole taken from him. Many of our men refused downright to comply with this; yet Cort\u00e9s managed to extort a good deal of it under the pretence of a loan&\u2026\"\nThe Memoirs of the Conquistador Bernal Diaz del Castillo, 1568\nAs described by the author, the driving philosophy behind the conquistadores' search for gold was the economic policy known as\n\nA. protectionism\nB. laissez-faire\nC. mercantilism\nD. supply-side\n",

            "content": "The driving philosophy behind the conquistadores' search for gold, as described by the author, Bernal Diaz del Castillo, in his Memoirs, is mercantilism. This economic policy is characterized by the belief that a country's wealth and power are best served by increasing its exports and accumulating gold and silver. The conquistadores were driven by the desire to accumulate wealth, which they believed would bring them power and influence. They believed that the more gold and silver they could accumulate, the more they could control the indigenous populations and the more they could assert their dominance over the New World.\n\nThe author describes how the conquistadores were willing to take extreme measures to acquire gold, including forcing the indigenous people to work in harsh conditions and even resorting to violence and intimidation. They also believed that the more gold they could accumulate, the more they could control the indigenous populations and the more they could assert their dominance over the New World.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. mercantilism.",
