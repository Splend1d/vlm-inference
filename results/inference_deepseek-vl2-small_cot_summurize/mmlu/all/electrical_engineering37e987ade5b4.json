It is typically wound in a closed loop around the armature.\n\nB. Lap winding: This is an additional winding that is wound around the closed winding. It is used to improve the magnetic field and increase the efficiency of the machine.\n\nC. Wave winding: This is not a necessary winding in a DC machine. Wave winding is a type of winding used in some AC machines, but it is not used in DC machines.\n\nD. Open type winding: This is not a necessary winding in a DC machine. Open type winding is a type of winding used in some AC machines, but it is not used in DC machines.\n\nTherefore, the correct answers are A and B.",
