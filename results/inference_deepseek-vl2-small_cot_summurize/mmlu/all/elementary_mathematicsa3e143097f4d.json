So, to find the time it takes her to develop one roll of film, we divide the total time by the number of rolls:\n\n\\[ \\text{Time per roll} = \\frac{18 \\text{ minutes}}{2 \\text{ rolls}} = 9 \\text{ minutes per roll} \\]\n\nNow, to find the time it takes her to develop 8 rolls of film, we multiply the time it takes to develop one roll by the number of rolls:\n\n\\[ \\text{Time for 8 rolls} = 9 \\text{ minutes per roll} \\times 8 \\text{ rolls} = 72 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nHowever, the question asks for the time in a specific format, and the options provided do not include 72 minutes. The closest option to 72 minutes is 1 hour 12 minutes, which is 72 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\[ \\text{B. 1 hour 12 minutes} \\]",
