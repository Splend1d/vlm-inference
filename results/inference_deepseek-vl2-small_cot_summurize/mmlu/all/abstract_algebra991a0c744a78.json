For \\(x = 0\\):\n\\[0^5 + 3(0)^3 + 0^2 + 2(0) = 0\\]\nThis is true, so \\(x = 0\\) is a zero.\n\n2. For \\(x = 1\\):\n\\[1^5 + 3(1)^3 + 1^2 + 2(1) = 1 + 3 + 1 + 2 = 7\\]\nThis is not equal to \\(0\\), so \\(x = 1\\) is not a zero.\n\n3. For \\(x = 2\\):\n\\[2^5 + 3(2)^3 + 2^2 + 2(2) = 32 + 24 + 4 + 4 = 64\\]\nThis is not equal to \\(0\\), so \\(x = 2\\) is not a zero.\n\n4. For \\(x = 3\\):\n\\[3^5 + 3(3)^3 + 3^2 + 2(3) = 243 + 81 + 9 + 6 = 339\\]\nThis is not equal to \\(0\\), so \\(x = 3\\) is not a zero.\n\n5. For \\(x = 4\\):\n\\[4^5 + 3(4)^3 + 4^2 + 2(4) = 1024 + 192 + 16 + 8 = 1236\\]\nThis is not equal to \\(0\\), so \\(x = 4\\) is not a zero.\n\nFrom the above calculations, we can see that the only value of \\(x\\) that satisfies the equation is \\(x = 0\\).\n\nTherefore, the only zero in the finite field \\(\\mathbb{Z}_5\\) for the polynomial \\(x^5 + 3x^3 + x^2 + 2x\\) is \\(x = 0\\).\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{A}\n\\]",
