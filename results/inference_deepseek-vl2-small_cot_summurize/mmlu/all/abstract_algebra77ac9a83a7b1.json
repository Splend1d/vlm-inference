The minimal polynomial of sqrt(18) over Q is x^2 - 18.\n\nSince the minimal polynomial of sqrt(18) over Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) is the same as the minimal polynomial of sqrt(18) over Q, the degree of the field extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) over Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) is 2.\n\nTherefore, the degree of the field extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) over Q is 2.\n\nThe correct answer is C. 2.",
