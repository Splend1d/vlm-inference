            "content": "To determine which statement is true about a thyroid swelling, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. It always elevates on swallowing: This statement is incorrect. While some thyroid swellings may elevate on swallowing due to pressure on the thyroid gland, not all thyroid swellings do. The elevation can vary depending on the size and location of the swelling.\n\nB. Lymph node enlargement is a good prognostic sign: This statement is incorrect. Lymph node enlargement is not a good prognostic sign for thyroid swellings. It is more commonly associated with metastatic disease rather than primary thyroid cancer.\n\nC. An ultrasound of the swelling is the best test to determine whether the nodule is actively secreting hormone: This statement is incorrect. An ultrasound is a useful imaging technique for evaluating thyroid swellings, but it is not the best test for determining hormone secretion. A functioning nodule on isotope scanning is more specific for assessing hormone secretion.\n\nD. A functioning nodule on isotope scanning is unlikely to be due to cancer: This statement is correct. A functioning nodule on isotope scanning, such as a hyperthyroid scan, is more likely to be due to a benign condition like a hyperthyroidism-related nodule rather than cancer. Cancerous nodules typically do not take up radioactive iodine.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. A functioning nodule on isotope scanning is unlikely to be due to cancer.",
