In other words, it satisfies the following properties:\n\n1. **Hermitian conjugation**: If $A$ is a Hermitian operator, then $A^\\dagger = A$, where $A^\\dagger$ is the Hermitian conjugate of $A$.\n2. **Inner product preservation**: If $A$ is a Hermitian operator, then $\\langle Ax, y \\rangle = \\langle x, Ay \\rangle$ for all vectors $x$ and $y$ in the domain of $A$.\n\nNow, let's consider the eigenvalues of a Hermitian operator. Suppose $A$ is a Hermitian operator with eigenvalues $\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\ldots, \\lambda_n$. Then, we can write:\n\n$$Ax = \\lambda x$$\n\nfor all vectors $x$ in the domain of $A$.\n\nTaking the Hermitian conjugate of both sides, we get:\n\n$$A^\\dagger Ax = \\lambda^\\dagger x$$\n\nUsing the properties of Hermitian conjugation, we can simplify this to:\n\n$$x^\\dagger A^\\dagger A x = \\lambda^\\dagger x$$\n\nwhere $x^\\dagger$ is the Hermitian conjugate of $x$.\n\nNow, we can use the fact that $A^\\dagger A = AA^\\dagger$ to rewrite the left-hand side as:\n\n$$x^\\dagger AA^\\dagger x = \\lambda^\\dagger x$$\n\nExpanding the left-hand side, we get:\n\n$$x^\\dagger A^\\dagger A x = \\lambda^\\dagger x$$\n\nComparing this with the original equation, we see that:\n\n$$\\lambda^\\dagger = \\lambda$$\n\nThis shows that the eigenvalues of a Hermitian operator are real.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nA. real",
