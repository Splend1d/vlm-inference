Literacy rates were generally low, especially in developing countries.\n\n2. **Literacy Rates in 1950**: According to historical data, the global literacy rate in 1950 was approximately 56%. This figure is based on estimates from various sources, including UNESCO and other international organizations.\n\n3. **Global Distribution**: Literacy rates varied significantly across different regions. In developed countries, literacy rates were much higher, often exceeding 90%. However, in many developing countries, literacy rates were much lower, often below 50%.\n\n4. **Implications**: The relatively low global literacy rate in 1950 highlights the challenges faced by many countries in providing education to their populations. This lack of literacy was a significant barrier to economic development and social progress.\n\nGiven this information, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 56%",
