While it can imply change, it doesn't specifically address the fluidity in working practices.\n\nB. **Fluid**: This term typically means something that flows easily and continuously, like a liquid. In the context of working practices, it suggests adaptability and ease of movement, which aligns with the concept of fluidity in tasks and spatial arrangements.\n\nC. **Flexible**: This term means able to be changed easily or adapted to different situations. While flexible working practices can involve adaptability, the term \"fluid\" more directly captures the essence of continuous and adaptable movement in tasks and space.\n\nD. **Modern**: This term refers to something that is current or up-to-date. It doesn't specifically address the fluidity in working practices.\n\nGiven the definitions and context, the term that best describes working practices involving temporal, spatial, and task-related fluidity is **B.
