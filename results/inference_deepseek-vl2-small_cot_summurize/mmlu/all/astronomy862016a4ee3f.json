            "content": "To determine the correct statement about the rotation of a solid disk, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. The velocity is the same on every point on the disk.\n- This statement is incorrect. In rotational motion, the velocity of a point on the edge of a disk is greater than that of a point closer to the center. This is because the distance from the axis is greater, and thus the rotational speed (angular velocity) is higher.\n\nB. The part closer to the axis has a longer period.\n- This statement is incorrect. The period of rotation is the time it takes for one complete rotation. It is independent of the distance from the axis. Therefore, the part closer to the axis does not have a longer period; it has the same period as any other point on the disk.\n\nC. The period of rotation is the same on every point on the disk.\n- This statement is correct. The period of rotation is determined by the angular velocity and the radius of the disk. Since the angular velocity is constant for a solid disk, the period of rotation is the same for all points on the disk.\n\nD. The part closer to the axis has a shorter period.\n- This statement is incorrect. As explained in option C, the period of rotation is the same for all points on the disk, regardless of their distance from the axis.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. The period of rotation is the same on every point on the disk.",
