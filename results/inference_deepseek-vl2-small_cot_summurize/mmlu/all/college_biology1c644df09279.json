            "content": "To determine which structures act as sites of gas exchange in a woody stem, we need to understand the anatomy and function of each option provided:\n\nA. **Lenticels**: These are small openings on the bark of woody plants, primarily found on the sides of stems and roots. They allow for the exchange of gases, such as oxygen and carbon dioxide, between the internal tissues of the plant and the atmosphere. This exchange is crucial for respiration and photosynthesis, as it facilitates the transport of gases necessary for these processes.\n\nB. **Terminal Buds**: These are the growing tips of stems and roots. They are responsible for the elongation of the plant and the formation of new branches and roots. While they play a role in growth, they are not primarily involved in gas exchange.\n\nC. **Nodes**: These are the points on a stem where leaves, branches, and buds are attached. Nodes are involved in the growth and branching of the plant but do not facilitate gas exchange.\n\nD. **Internodes**: These are the sections of a stem between two nodes. They are involved in the elongation of the stem and do not participate in gas exchange.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Lenticels\n\nLenticels are the structures that allow for the necessary gas exchange in woody stems, making them essential for the plant's respiratory and photosynthetic processes.",
