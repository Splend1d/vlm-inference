            "content": "To determine the fate of most popular third-party movements, we need to consider the dynamics of political parties and the nature of third-party support.\n\nOption A suggests that third-party movements can displace one of the two major parties and become major parties themselves. This is a common myth, as third parties often struggle to gain significant traction and support. The U.S. political system is designed to favor two-party dominance, with the duopoly of the Democratic and Republican parties being well-established. While third parties can gain some influence, they rarely displace the major parties.\n\nOption B posits that third-party movements are abandoned by the public because their politics are perceived as too radical. This is a plausible scenario, as third parties often challenge the status quo and propose radical changes. However, this does not necessarily mean they are abandoned by the public. Some third parties, like the Libertarian Party, have a dedicated base that remains loyal despite their radical nature.\n\nOption C suggests that supporters of third parties become frustrated and withdraw from the political process. This is a common outcome for third-party supporters, who may feel that their efforts are futile. However, this does not describe the fate of most third-party movements, as they often persist with their goals and continue to influence the political discourse.\n\nOption D states that third-party movements disintegrate when one or both of the major parties adopt the third party's goals. This is a realistic outcome, as major parties often incorporate elements of third-party platforms to appeal to a broader audience. For example, the Democratic Party has incorporated progressive policies that were originally advocated by third parties like the Green Party.\n\nConsidering these points, the most accurate description of the fate of most popular third-party movements is:\n\nD. They disintegrate when one or both of the major parties adopt the third party's goals.",
