            "content": "To understand why the sky appears blue, we need to consider the behavior of light as it passes through the Earth's atmosphere.\n\n1. **Light and Atmosphere Interaction**: When sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere, it encounters molecules and particles. These particles scatter the light in different directions.\n\n2. **Scattering of Light**: The scattering of light is known as Rayleigh scattering. This process is more effective for shorter wavelengths of light, such as blue and violet, than for longer wavelengths, like red.\n\n3. **Color Perception**: Because the atmosphere scatters blue light more than other colors, the sky appears blue to our eyes. This is why the sky looks blue during the day, even though the sun itself emits a white light.\n\n4. **Other Options**:\n   - **Option A** is incorrect because the molecules in the atmosphere do not have a blue-ish color; they are transparent and do not contribute to the color of the sky.\n   - **Option B** is incorrect because the sky does not reflect the color of the oceans; the color of the sky is due to the scattering of sunlight.\n   - **Option D** is incorrect because the atmosphere does not absorb all other colors; it allows most colors to pass through, which is why the sky appears blue.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **C. Because the atmosphere preferentially scatters short wavelengths.**",
