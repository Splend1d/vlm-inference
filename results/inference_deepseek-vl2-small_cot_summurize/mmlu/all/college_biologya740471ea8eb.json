            "content": "To determine the correct statement about the cohesion-tension theory, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. The evaporation of water from leaf mesophyll cells generates tension in the water column.\n- This statement is incorrect. The evaporation of water from leaf mesophyll cells does not generate tension in the water column. Instead, it contributes to the transpiration pull, which is a driving force for water movement in the xylem.\n\nB. Water moves from a source region with high hydrostatic pressure to a sink region with low hydrostatic pressure.\n- This statement is correct. The cohesion-tension theory explains that water moves from areas of high hydrostatic pressure (such as the roots) to areas of low hydrostatic pressure (such as the leaves). This movement is driven by the tension created by the cohesion of water molecules and the pull of transpiration.\n\nC. The cohesion of water molecules is responsible for the formation of embolisms (air bubbles) in the water column.\n- This statement is incorrect. The cohesion of water molecules is responsible for the movement of water, not the formation of embolisms. Embolisms are typically caused by the collapse of the water column due to a decrease in hydrostatic pressure, often resulting from a blockage or a decrease in transpiration pull.\n\nD. Living cells of the xylem provide the main conduit for an ascent of water.\n- This statement is incorrect. While living cells of the xylem do play a role in the transport of water, the main conduit for water movement is the xylem vessels, which are dead cells that have lost their nuclei and organelles.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is B: Water moves from a source region with high hydrostatic pressure to a sink region with low hydrostatic pressure.",
