In a marathon, the focus is on sustaining a long-distance effort, so strength alone is not the primary attribute.\n\nB. **Power**: Power is the ability to generate force quickly, which is crucial for the initial push-off and maintaining speed. However, marathon running requires sustained energy over a long period, so power alone is not sufficient.\n\nC. **Stride Length**: Stride length refers to the distance covered with each step. While it can affect efficiency and speed, it is not the most critical attribute for marathon running. Runners can adjust their stride length to suit their comfort and efficiency.\n\nD. **Stamina**: Stamina is the ability to sustain physical activity over a long period. In a marathon, runners need to maintain a consistent pace for several hours, which requires a high level of endurance and the ability to manage fatigue. Therefore, stamina is the key attribute for success in marathon running.\n\nAfter evaluating each option, the most critical attribute for successful marathon running is **D. Stamina**.",
