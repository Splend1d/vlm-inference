This causes the frequency of the sound waves to change, resulting in a change in pitch.\n\n- When the source of sound moves toward you, the sound waves are compressed, and the frequency increases, making the sound sound higher in pitch.\n- When the source of sound moves away from you, the sound waves are stretched, and the frequency decreases, making the sound sound lower in pitch.\n\nThis effect is commonly observed in situations such as a siren moving toward you or away from you, or a car driving past you.",
