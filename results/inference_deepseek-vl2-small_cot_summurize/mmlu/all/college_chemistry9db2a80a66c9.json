            "content": "To determine the number of lines in the EPR spectrum of a solution of dimethylnitroxide (CH3)2NO\u2022, we need to consider the number of unpaired electrons in the molecule.\n\n1. **Understanding EPR Spectrum**: Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy is used to study the magnetic properties of unpaired electrons. The number of lines in an EPR spectrum is directly related to the number of unpaired electrons.\n\n2. **Molecular Structure**: Dimethylnitrosoxide (CH3)2NO\u2022 consists of a nitroso group (NO\u2022) and two methyl groups (CH3). The nitroso group contains one unpaired electron, and each methyl group contains one unpaired electron.\n\n3. **Counting Unpaired Electrons**:\n   - The nitroso group (NO\u2022) has 1 unpaired electron.\n   - Each methyl group (CH3) has 1 unpaired electron.\n\n4. **Total Unpaired Electrons**: Adding these together gives us the total number of unpaired electrons:\n   - 1 (from NO\u2022) + 2 (from CH3) = 3 unpaired electrons.\n\n5. **Number of Lines in EPR Spectrum**: The number of lines in an EPR spectrum is equal to the number of unpaired electrons. Therefore, there will be 3 lines in the EPR spectrum of dimethylnitrosoxide (CH3)2NO\u2022.\n\nThus, the correct answer is B. 3.",
