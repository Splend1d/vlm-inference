            "content": "To determine which disadvantages are associated with the Dickey-Fuller/Engle-Granger approach, let's analyze each statement:\n\ni) Only one cointegrating relationship can be estimated: This is a disadvantage because the Dickey-Fuller test is a single-equation test, meaning it can only test for a single cointegrating relationship. If there are multiple cointegrating relationships, this test will not be able to detect them.\n\nii) Particularly for small samples. There is a high chance of the tests suggesting that variables are not cointegrated when they are: This is a disadvantage because the Dickey-Fuller test is sensitive to sample size. In small samples, the test may not have enough power to detect a cointegrating relationship, leading to incorrect conclusions.\n\niii) It is not possible to make inferences on the cointegrating regression: This is a disadvantage because the Dickey-Fuller test does not provide information about the parameters of the cointegrating regression. It only tests for the presence of a cointegrating relationship.\n\niv) The procedure forces the researcher to specify which is the dependent variable and which are the independent variables: This is not a disadvantage of the Dickey-Fuller test, but rather a characteristic of the test. The test requires the researcher to specify the variables in the model, which is a necessary step in any regression analysis.\n\nBased on this analysis, the disadvantages of the Dickey-Fuller/Engle-Granger approach are:\n\ni) Only one cointegrating relationship can be estimated\nii) Particularly for small samples. There is a high chance of the tests suggesting that variables are not cointegrated when they are\niii) It is not possible to make inferences on the cointegrating regression\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. (i), (ii), and (iii) only.",
