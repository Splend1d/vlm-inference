            "content": "Boiling and freezing are phase changes of water that occur due to changes in temperature. When water is heated, its molecules gain energy and move faster, eventually overcoming the intermolecular forces that hold them in the liquid state. This results in boiling, where water turns into steam. Conversely, when water is cooled, its molecules lose energy and slow down, eventually losing enough energy to break free from the intermolecular forces, leading to freezing, where water turns into ice.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. increased temperatures",
