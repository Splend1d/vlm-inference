This concept is closely related to the idea of political efficacy, which is the belief in one's ability to affect political outcomes. It is a crucial aspect of democratic theory, as it encourages active citizenship and participation in the political process.\n\nOption A is incorrect because political parties can provide a check to the political influence wielded by corporations, but this is not directly related to political efficacy.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the system of checks and balances ensures that the government is both efficient and productive, but this is not directly related to political efficacy.\n\nOption D is incorrect because politicians have a duty to inform their constituents about the democratic process, but this is not directly related to political efficacy.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Individuals believe that they can influence the government through participation in the democratic process.\n\nSo, the final answer is $\\boxed{B}$.",
