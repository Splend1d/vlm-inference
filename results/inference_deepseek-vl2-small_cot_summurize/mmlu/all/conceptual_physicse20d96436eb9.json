It is calculated as the product of the force applied and the distance from the axis of rotation (the lever arm). This means that the torque depends on both the magnitude of the force and the length of the lever arm.\n\nLet's break down the options:\n\nA. Like any other force: This is incorrect because torque is not just any force; it is a specific type of force that causes rotation.\n\nB. Multiplied by a lever arm: This is correct. Torque is defined as the product of the force applied and the distance from the axis of rotation (the lever arm).\n\nC. That is fictitious: This is incorrect. Torque is a real physical quantity that can be measured and has practical applications in physics and engineering.\n\nD. That accelerates things: This is incorrect. Torque causes an object to rotate, not to accelerate linearly. Acceleration is a linear force, not a rotational force.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.",
