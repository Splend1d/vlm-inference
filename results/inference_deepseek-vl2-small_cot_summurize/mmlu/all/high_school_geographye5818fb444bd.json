It is not related to geographical coordinates.\n\nC. **An absolute location**: This refers to a specific point in space that can be pinpointed using latitude and longitude coordinates. Latitude and longitude provide a precise location on Earth's surface.\n\nD. **A relative location**: This describes the position of something in relation to other things, such as \"north of\" or \"south of.\" It does not refer to specific coordinates.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nC. an absolute location.\n\nThe latitude and longitude coordinates of a place are an example of an absolute location because they provide a precise point on Earth's surface.",
