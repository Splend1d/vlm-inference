They include adenine (A) and guanine (G). These bases pair with pyrimidines to form the rungs of the DNA double helix.\n\nB. **Pyrimidine**: Pyrimidines are another class of nitrogenous bases found in DNA. They include cytosine (C), thymine (T), and uracil (U). These bases pair with purines to form the rungs of the DNA double helix.\n\nC. **Deoxyribose**: Deoxyribose is a five-carbon sugar that forms the backbone of DNA. It is a crucial component of the DNA structure, linking the nitrogenous bases together.\n\nD. **Amino acid**: Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins, not DNA. They are involved in the synthesis of proteins, which are essential for various cellular functions, but they do not form part of the DNA structure.\n\nBy examining each option, we can conclude that the molecule that does not form part of DNA is:\n\nD. Amino acid.",
