            "content": "To understand the outcome of a prolonged drought in the Galapagos, we need to consider the concept of natural selection. Natural selection is the process by which organisms better adapted to their environment tend to survive and produce more offspring. In this scenario, the environment is characterized by a lack of food, specifically small, easily eaten seeds.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Small birds gaining larger beaks by exercising their mouth parts.\n- This option suggests that small birds are actively changing their beaks. However, natural selection does not involve active changes in an organism's traits. Instead, it is about the differential survival and reproduction of individuals with certain traits.\n\nB. Small birds mutating their beak genes with the result that later-generation offspring have larger beaks.\n- Mutations are random changes in DNA and are not typically directed by natural selection. Moreover, mutations do not necessarily lead to beneficial traits in a given environment.\n\nC. Small birds anticipating the long drought and eating more to gain weight and, consequently, growing larger beaks.\n- This option implies that small birds are adapting to the drought by changing their behavior. While this might seem logical, it does not align with the principles of natural selection, which focuses on traits that affect survival and reproduction in the environment.\n\nD. More small-beaked birds dying than larger-beaked birds. The offspring produced in subsequent generations have a higher percentage of birds with large beaks.\n- This option correctly describes the process of natural selection. During a drought, small-beaked birds are less able to access food, leading to higher mortality rates. In contrast, larger-beaked birds are better adapted to the environment and have a higher survival rate. As a result, the proportion of large-beaked birds in the population increases over generations.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. More small-beaked birds dying than larger-beaked birds. The offspring produced in subsequent generations have a higher percentage of birds with large beaks.",
