Estimate the model in first differenced form.\n\nWhen a regression model is estimated and the residuals are found to be non-normal, it suggests that the model may not be capturing the underlying patterns in the data accurately. One way to address this issue is to estimate the model in first differenced form. This involves taking the difference between consecutive observations of the dependent variable, which can help to remove trends and seasonality that may be present in the data. By doing so, the model can better capture the short-term dynamics of the data, which may be more consistent with the non-normal residuals.\n\nOption A, using a logarithmic functional form instead of a linear one, is not necessarily a plausible response to residual non-normality. While a logarithmic transformation can sometimes help to stabilize variance and make the data more normal, it is not a guaranteed solution and may not address the underlying issues with the model.\n\nOption B, adding lags of the variables on the right-hand side of the regression model, is also not a plausible response to residual non-normality. Adding lags can help to capture short-term dynamics, but it may also introduce multicollinearity and other issues if not done carefully.\n\nOption D, removing any large outliers from the data, is not a plausible response to residual non-normality. While outliers can affect the results of a regression analysis, simply removing them may not address the underlying issues with the model. Instead, it is often more effective to address the issues with the model itself, such as by estimating the model in first differenced form.",
