This means they have a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles. This is a fundamental characteristic of fungi.\n\nB. They all have rigid cell walls.\n- Most fungi have rigid cell walls composed of chitin, a complex carbohydrate. This characteristic is a defining feature of fungi, distinguishing them from other eukaryotic organisms like plants and algae.\n\nC. Most are filamentous.\n- Many fungi are indeed filamentous, meaning they grow in thread-like structures called hyphae. This is a common trait among fungi, especially in the Ascomycota and Basidiomycota groups.\n\nD. Some are photosynthetic.\n- Photosynthesis is a process used by plants, algae, and some bacteria to convert light energy into chemical energy. Fungi do not perform photosynthesis. Instead, they obtain nutrients by decomposing organic matter.\n\nBased on this analysis, the statement that is NOT true about fungi is:\n\nD. Some are photosynthetic.",
