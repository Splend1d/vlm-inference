            "content": "The lunar maria are dark, basaltic plains that cover about 14% of the Moon's surface. They are primarily composed of ancient lava flows that filled older impact basins. These maria are characterized by their dark color, which is due to the basalt rock that was formed from the cooling and solidification of lava.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Ancient heavily cratered highlands: This description does not fit the lunar maria. Highlands are regions of the Moon that are not covered by maria and are characterized by their lighter color and more cratered appearance.\n\nB. Dark lavas inside volcanic calderas: This description is partially correct. The maria are indeed dark, but they are not located inside volcanic calderas. Calderas are large, bowl-shaped depressions that are formed when a volcano erupts and the magma chamber is emptied. The maria are formed from lava that fills these depressions, but they are not located inside them.\n\nC. Dark lavas filling older impact basins: This description accurately defines the lunar maria. The maria are dark, basaltic plains that fill older impact basins on the Moon. These basins were formed when large asteroids or comets collided with the Moon, creating a large crater. Over time, the crater was filled with lava, which cooled and solidified to form the maria.\n\nD. The bright regions on the Moon: This description does not fit the lunar maria. The bright regions on the Moon are highlands, which are not covered by maria. The maria are dark, not bright.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Dark lavas filling older impact basins.",
