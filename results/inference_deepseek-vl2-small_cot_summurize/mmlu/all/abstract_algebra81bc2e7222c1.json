This theorem states that every finite abelian group can be expressed as a direct product of cyclic groups of prime power order. Specifically, if \\( G \\) is a finite abelian group of order \\( n \\), then \\( G \\) can be written as:\n\\[ G \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_n \\times \\mathbb{Z}_m \\times \\cdots \\times \\mathbb{Z}_k \\]\nwhere \\( n = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \\cdots p_k^{e_k} \\) and \\( p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_k \\) are distinct prime numbers, and \\( e_1, e_2, \\ldots, e_k \\) are positive integers.\n\nFor any positive integer \\( d \\) that divides \\( n \\), there exists a cyclic subgroup of \\( G \\) of order \\( d \\). This is because \\( d \\) can be written as a product of prime powers, and each prime power \\( p_i^{e_i} \\) in the prime factorization of \\( n \\) can form a cyclic subgroup of \\( G \\) of order \\( e_i \\). Therefore, the statement is true.\n\n**Statement 2:** If \\( a \\) belongs to a finite group then \\( |a| \\) divides \\( |G| \\).\n\nThis statement is a direct consequence of Lagrange's theorem in group theory. Lagrange's theorem states that for any finite group \\( G \\), the order (number of elements) of any subgroup \\( H \\) of \\( G \\) divides the order of \\( G \\). In the context of the statement, \\( |a| \\) is the order of the element \\( a \\), and \\( |G| \\) is the order of the group \\( G \\). Therefore, the order of any element \\( a \\) in \\( G \\) must divide the order of \\( G \\). This statement is true.\n\nSince both statements are true, the correct answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{A}\n\\]",
