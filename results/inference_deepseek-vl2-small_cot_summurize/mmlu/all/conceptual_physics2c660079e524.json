            "content": "To understand the relationship between energy and mass in fission and fusion, we need to consider the principles of mass-energy equivalence, as described by Einstein's equation \\(E=mc^2\\).\n\n1. **Mass-Energy Equivalence**: This principle states that mass and energy are interchangeable. The equation \\(E=mc^2\\) shows that energy (E) is equal to mass (m) times the speed of light squared (c\u00b2). This means that any amount of mass can be converted into energy, and vice versa.\n\n2. **Fission**: In nuclear fission, a heavy nucleus splits into two or more lighter nuclei, releasing a significant amount of energy. This process involves the conversion of a small amount of mass into energy, as described by the equation \\(E=mc^2\\). The mass defect, which is the difference between the mass of the original nucleus and the sum of the masses of the resulting nuclei, is converted into energy.\n\n3. **Fusion**: In nuclear fusion, two light nuclei combine to form a heavier nucleus, releasing energy. Similar to fission, this process also involves the conversion of mass into energy. The mass defect in this case is the difference between the mass of the resulting nucleus and the sum of the masses of the original nuclei.\n\n4. **Conservation of Mass**: While the mass of the resulting nuclei in fusion is less than the sum of the masses of the original nuclei, the total mass of the system (nuclei plus energy) remains constant. This is a direct consequence of the conservation of mass-energy, which states that mass and energy are conserved in all physical processes.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: In both fission and fusion, energy is released, and mass is converted into energy. However, the total mass of the system remains unchanged, as the mass defect is converted into energy.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. remains unchanged; is conserved",
