            "content": "To determine the correct range of the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum, we need to understand the boundaries of this range. The visible spectrum is the portion of the electromagnetic spectrum that is visible to the human eye.\n\n1. **Understanding the Electromagnetic Spectrum**: The electromagnetic spectrum includes all types of electromagnetic radiation, ranging from low-energy radio waves to high-energy gamma rays. The visible spectrum is a small part of this spectrum, located between the infrared and ultraviolet regions.\n\n2. **Identifying the Visible Spectrum**: The visible spectrum is typically defined as the range of wavelengths that human eyes can detect. This range is approximately from 380 nanometers (nm) to 740 nm.\n\n3. **Analyzing the Options**:\n   - **Option A: 240 to 680 nm**: This range is too low, as it includes wavelengths that are in the infrared region, which are not visible to the human eye.\n   - **Option B: 360 to 620 nm**: This range is also too low, as it includes wavelengths that are in the ultraviolet region, which are not visible to the human eye.\n   - **Option C: 380 to 740 nm**: This range is correct, as it includes the wavelengths that are visible to the human eye.\n   - **Option D: 420 to 810 nm**: This range is too high, as it includes wavelengths that are in the infrared region, which are not visible to the human eye.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the correct range of the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum is from 380 nm to 740 nm.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **C. 380 to 740 nm**.",
