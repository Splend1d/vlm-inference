            "content": "To subtract 2,396 from 1,709, we can use the standard subtraction method.\n\n1. Align the numbers by their place values:\n   ```\n   2,396\n  -1,709\n   ```\n\n2. Subtract the rightmost digits (the ones place):\n   ```\n   2 - 9 = -7\n   ```\n   Since we have a negative result, we write down 7 and carry over 1 to the next column.\n\n3. Subtract the next digits (the tens place):\n   ```\n   3 - 0 = 3\n   ```\n\n4. Subtract the next digits (the hundreds place):\n   ```\n   9 - 7 = 2\n   ```\n\n5. Subtract the next digits (the thousands place):\n   ```\n   2 - 1 = 1\n   ```\n\n6. Subtract the next digits (the ten-thousands place):\n   ```\n   1 - 0 = 1\n   ```\n\n7. Subtract the next digits (the hundred-thousands place):\n   ```\n   0 - 1 = -1\n   ```\n\n8. Subtract the next digits (the millions place):\n   ```\n   0 - 0 = 0\n   ```\n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n```\n  1,695\n```\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\nD. 1,695",
