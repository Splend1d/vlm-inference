Divide 48 by 2: \\( 48 \\div 2 = 24 \\).\n3. Continue dividing by 2: \\( 24 \\div 2 = 12 \\).\n4. Divide 12 by 2: \\( 12 \\div 2 = 6 \\).\n5. Divide 6 by 2: \\( 6 \\div 2 = 3 \\).\n6. Divide 3 by 3: \\( 3 \\div 3 = 1 \\).\n\nNow, we have factored 48 into its prime factors: \\( 2^4 \\cdot 3^1 \\).\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\\[ D. 2^4 \\cdot 3 \\]",
