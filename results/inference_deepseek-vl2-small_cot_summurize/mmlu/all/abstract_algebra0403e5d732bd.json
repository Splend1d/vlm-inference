This means that every element in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_{26}\\) is an integer from 0 to 25, inclusive, and we perform addition and multiplication modulo 26.\n\nThe multiplication in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_{26}\\) is defined as follows:\n- For any \\(a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{26}\\), \\(a \\cdot b \\equiv a + b \\pmod{26}\\).\n\nGiven the elements \\(20\\) and \\(-8\\) in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_{26}\\), we need to compute \\(20 \\cdot (-8)\\).\n\nUsing the property of addition and multiplication modulo 26, we have:\n\\[\n20 \\cdot (-8) \\equiv 20 + (-8) \\pmod{26}\n\\]\n\nNow, we perform the addition:\n\\[\n20 + (-8) = 20 - 8 = 12\n\\]\n\nSince we are working modulo 26, we need to find the remainder when 12 is divided by 26:\n\\[\n12 \\mod 26 = 12\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the product of \\(20\\) and \\(-8\\) in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_{26}\\) is:\n\\[\n20 \\cdot (-8) \\equiv 12 \\pmod{26}\n\\]\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{C}\n\\]",
