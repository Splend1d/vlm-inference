            "content": "To determine which statement is NOT correct about apoptosis, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. It occurs randomly.\n- Apoptosis is not a random process. It is a highly regulated and controlled process that is triggered by specific signals within the cell. This regulation ensures that only cells that are no longer needed or are damaged are eliminated, maintaining tissue integrity and function.\n\nB. A particular cell dies when it is no longer needed by the organism.\n- This statement is correct. Apoptosis is a mechanism by which cells are removed from the organism when they are no longer needed, such as during development or when they are damaged.\n\nC. A cell carries out apoptosis when too many mutations have accumulated.\n- This statement is also correct. Apoptosis can be triggered by the accumulation of mutations, which can lead to the development of cancerous cells. The cell's immune system can recognize these mutations and initiate apoptosis to prevent the spread of cancer.\n\nD. Plant cells carry out apoptosis as a defense measure in cells that have been infected by parasites.\n- This statement is correct. Plant cells can undergo apoptosis as a defense mechanism against parasitic infections. This process helps to eliminate infected cells and prevent the spread of the parasite within the plant.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, it is clear that the statement that is NOT correct about apoptosis is:\n\nA. It occurs randomly.",
