            "content": "To understand the interpretation of the null hypothesis in the context of the Engle-Granger test, we need to consider the purpose of the test. The Engle-Granger test is used to determine whether the residuals of a regression model are cointegrated. Cointegration implies that the variables in the model are long-run equilibrium, meaning they move together in the long run.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. The variables are cointegrated: This would be the correct interpretation if the null hypothesis were rejected. However, the null hypothesis is not rejected, so this option is incorrect.\n\nB. The variables are not cointegrated: This is the correct interpretation when the null hypothesis is not rejected. The Engle-Granger test assesses whether the residuals are cointegrated. If the null hypothesis is not rejected, it indicates that the residuals are not cointegrated, meaning the variables are not long-run equilibrium.\n\nC. Both variables are stationary: This option is incorrect because the Engle-Granger test specifically tests for cointegration, not stationarity.\n\nD. Both variables are non-stationary: This option is also incorrect because the test is specifically designed to detect cointegration, not non-stationarity.\n\nTherefore, the correct interpretation of the null hypothesis in the Engle-Granger test is that the variables are not cointegrated.\n\nFinal Answer: B. The variables are not cointegrated.",
