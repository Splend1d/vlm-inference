These countries have the most advanced technology, industrial capacity, and economic power. They are the primary drivers of the global economy and political systems.\n\n2. **Periphery**: This is the outer part of the world system, where less developed countries are located. These countries often have limited industrial capacity, lower levels of technology, and are more dependent on the core countries for economic and technological support.\n\n3. **Semi-periphery**: This is a transitional zone between the core and the periphery. Semi-peripheral countries have some industrial capacity and technological development but are not as advanced as the core countries. They often have mixed economic structures and are influenced by both core and periphery dynamics.\n\nOptions B, C, and D do not accurately describe the world systems theory:\n\n- **B. rich and poor**: This is a simplistic and outdated view that does not account for the complex structures and relationships within the world system.\n- **C. developed and undeveloped**: This is a more modern term but still does not capture the nuanced divisions within the world system as described by Wallerstein.\n- **D. haves and have-nots**: This is a common phrase used to describe economic disparities but does not specifically address the divisions within the world system as defined by Wallerstein.",
