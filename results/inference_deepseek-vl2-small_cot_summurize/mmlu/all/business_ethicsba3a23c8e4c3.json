They often involve legal requirements and standards that companies must adhere to, such as labor laws, environmental regulations, and ethical business practices.\n\n2. **Social Programmes**: These are the initiatives and projects that companies undertake to address social issues. They can include charitable donations, community development programs, and other activities aimed at improving social conditions.\n\n3. **Social Impacts**: This refers to the effects of CSR activities on society. It includes both positive and negative impacts, such as improvements in community health, education, and economic conditions, as well as potential negative consequences like displacement of communities or environmental degradation.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct outcomes of CSR as per Wood (1991) are:\n\n- **Social Policies**: Legal and regulatory requirements.\n- **Social Programmes**: Initiatives and projects.\n- **Social Impacts**: Effects of CSR activities.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Social policies, Social evidencing and Social impacts\n\nThis option accurately reflects the three key outcomes of CSR as described by Wood (1991).",
