            "content": "To understand the stages of mitosis, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Prophase \u2014 Dissolution of nucleoli**\n   - During prophase, the chromatin condenses into visible chromosomes, and the nucleolus disappears. This is because the nucleolus is involved in ribosome synthesis, which is not needed during mitosis.\n\nB. **Metaphase \u2014 Formation of two distinct nuclear membranes**\n   - In metaphase, chromosomes align at the metaphase plate (the cell's equatorial plane). This alignment is crucial for ensuring that each daughter cell will receive an identical set of chromosomes. The nuclear membrane does not form during metaphase; it is a process that occurs during telophase.\n\nC. **Telophase \u2014 Formation of the equatorial plate**\n   - Telophase is characterized by the de-condensation of chromosomes back into chromatin, the reformation of the nuclear envelope around each set of chromosomes, and the appearance of the nucleolus. The equatorial plate is not a component of telophase; it is a structure involved in cytokinesis.\n\nD. **Anaphase \u2014 Separation of the cytoplasm and organelles**\n   - During anaphase, the sister chromatids are pulled apart by the spindle fibers and move to opposite poles of the cell. This separation ensures that each daughter cell will receive an identical set of chromosomes. The cytoplasm and organelles do not separate during anaphase; this occurs during cytokinesis.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Prophase \u2014 Dissolution of nucleoli",
