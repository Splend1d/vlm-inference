This figure is based on data from the World Bank and other reliable sources.\n\n3. **Calculation**:\n   - Total population: 7.6 billion\n   - Percentage with access to electricity: 80%\n\n   To find the number of people with access to electricity, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of people with access to electricity} = 7.6 \\text{ billion} \\times 0.80 = 6.08 \\text{ billion}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Therefore, approximately 6.08 billion people had access to electricity as of 2017.\n\nGiven the options:\nA. 60%\nB. 70%\nC. 80%\nD. 90%\n\nThe correct answer is C. 80%.",
