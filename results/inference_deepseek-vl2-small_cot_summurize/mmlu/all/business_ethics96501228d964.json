It aligns with Carroll's framework, which includes Economic, Legal, Ethical, and Philanthropic aspects.\n\n- **Option C: Economic, Legal, Cultural and Philanthropic**\n  - This option is incorrect because it includes \"Cultural,\" which is not part of Carroll's framework.\n\n- **Option D: Economic, Legal, Ethical and Environmental**\n  - This option is incorrect because it includes \"Environmental,\" which is not part of Carroll's framework.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. Economic, Legal, Ethical and Philanthropic**.",
