            "content": "To determine which accounts for the growth in the power and prestige of the presidency since 1932, let's analyze each option:\n\nI. America's increased prominence in international affairs: While the United States has become more prominent on the international stage, this factor primarily affects the president's role in foreign policy and diplomacy. It does not directly explain the growth in the president's power and prestige within the domestic sphere.\n\nII. Continuously improved public confidence in the federal government: This factor is crucial in explaining the growth in the president's power and prestige. As the public's confidence in the federal government increases, the president's role and influence expand. This is because a more trusted government can implement policies and programs that were previously considered too radical or controversial.\n\nIII. The New Deal and other programs that have expanded federal responsibility: The New Deal and other programs expanded the federal government's role in the economy and society. This shift in power and responsibility has contributed to the growth in the president's power and prestige.\n\nIV. The president's increased visibility, due to the development of mass media: While the president's visibility has increased due to mass media, this factor primarily affects the public's perception of the president and does not directly account for the growth in the president's power and prestige.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is D. II and IV only. The growth in the power and prestige of the presidency since 1932 can be attributed to improved public confidence in the federal government and the president's increased visibility due to mass media.",
