They do not have trees that drop their leaves in the winter.\n- **Tundra (B)**: Tundra is a cold, treeless region with permafrost. It does not have deciduous trees that shed their leaves in the winter.\n- **Taiga (C)**: Taiga, also known as boreal forests, consists of coniferous trees like spruce, pine, and fir. These trees retain their needles year-round and do not shed them in the winter.\n- **Deciduous forests (D)**: Deciduous forests are characterized by trees that shed their leaves annually. During the winter months, these trees lose their leaves to conserve water and energy.\n\nTherefore, the biome that contains trees that drop their leaves during the winter months is deciduous forests.",
