This is because the plates are parallel and the electric field is created by the charge distribution on the plates. The field does not weaken with distance inside the plates.\n\nB. **The electric field between a pair of oppositely charged parallel plates follows the inverse-square law.**\n\n- The electric field between two parallel plates is uniform and does not follow the inverse-square law. The inverse-square law applies to the electric field between a point charge and a point charge, not between two parallel plates.\n\nC. **Both of these statements are correct.**\n\n- As previously analyzed, neither statement is correct. The electric field between parallel plates is uniform and does not follow the inverse-square law.\n\nD. **Neither of these statements are correct.**\n\n- This option is correct because both statements A and B are incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Neither of these",
