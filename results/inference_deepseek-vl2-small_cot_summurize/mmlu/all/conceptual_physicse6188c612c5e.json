            "content": "To determine when the highest ocean tides occur, we need to understand the gravitational forces involved. The primary forces causing tides are the gravitational pull of the Moon and the Sun on Earth's oceans.\n\n1. **Gravitational Forces**: The Moon's gravitational pull is the dominant force causing tides. The Sun also exerts a gravitational force, but it is much weaker compared to the Moon's.\n\n2. **Alignment of Forces**: The highest tides occur when the gravitational forces of the Moon and the Sun are aligned. This alignment is known as syzygy.\n\n3. **Syzygy**: Syzygy refers to the alignment of celestial bodies, such as the Sun, Moon, and Earth. When the Sun, Moon, and Earth are aligned, the gravitational forces combine to create the strongest tidal forces.\n\n4. **Spring and Neap Tides**:\n   - **Spring Tides**: These occur when the Sun, Moon, and Earth are in a straight line. This alignment maximizes the combined gravitational pull, resulting in the highest tides.\n   - **Neap Tides**: These occur when the Sun and Moon are at right angles to each other. The gravitational forces partially cancel each other out, resulting in lower tides.\n\nGiven this information, the highest ocean tides occur when the Earth, Moon, and Sun are aligned, which corresponds to spring tides.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. lined up during spring",
