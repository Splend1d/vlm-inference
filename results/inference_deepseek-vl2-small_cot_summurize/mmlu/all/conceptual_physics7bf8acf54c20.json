This means that the shorter wavelengths of light (blue and violet) are scattered out of our line of sight by the atmosphere, while the longer wavelengths (red and orange) are more easily transmitted. This scattering effect is known as Rayleigh scattering, named after the British physicist Lord Rayleigh, who first described it in the late 19th century.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nB. transmitted",
