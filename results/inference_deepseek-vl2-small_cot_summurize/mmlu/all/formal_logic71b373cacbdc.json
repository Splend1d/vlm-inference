England's importing beef is a necessary condition for France's subsidizing agriculture.\n2. China's promoting human rights is not a sufficient condition for South Africa's supplying diamonds.\n\nLet's translate these parts into logical symbols:\n1. E \u2261 F (England's importing beef is a necessary condition for France's subsidizing agriculture)\n2. ~C \u2283 S (China's promoting human rights is not a sufficient condition for South Africa's supplying diamonds)\n\nNow, let's match these with the given formulas:\nA. (E \u2261 F) \u2228 ~(C \u2261 S)\nB. (E \u2261 F) \u2228 (~C \u2283 S)\nC. (E \u2283 F) \u2228 ~(C \u2283 S)\nD. (F \u2283 E) \u2228 ~(C \u2283 S)\n\nThe correct formula should represent both parts of the sentence. Let's analyze each option:\n\nA. (E \u2261 F) \u2228 ~(C \u2261 S)\n- This formula represents the first part of the sentence but not the second part.\n\nB. (E \u2261 F) \u2228 (~C \u2283 S)\n- This formula represents both parts of the sentence.\n\nC. (E \u2283 F) \u2228 ~(C \u2283 S)\n- This formula represents the first part of the sentence but not the second part.\n\nD. (F \u2283 E) \u2228 ~(C \u2283 S)\n- This formula represents the second part of the sentence but not the first part.\n\nTherefore, the best symbolization of the given sentence is:\nB.
