The \"float\" state is a special state that indicates that the buffer is not connected to any other circuit and is not transmitting any data.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it lists \"float\" as a separate state, which is not a valid state for a three-state buffer.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it lists \"High\" and \"Low\" as separate states, which is not a valid state for a three-state buffer.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it lists \"Set\" and \"Reset\" as separate states, which are not relevant to the operation of a three-state buffer.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.
