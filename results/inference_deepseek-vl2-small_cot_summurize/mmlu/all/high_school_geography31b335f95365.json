It is characterized by a quick and widespread adoption of a new idea or product.\n\nB. **Relocation diffusion**: This involves the spread of innovations or ideas through the movement of people. It is less common in the context of global fashion design, as it primarily relies on human migration rather than the spread of information.\n\nC. **Innovative diffusion**: This is the process by which new ideas, products, or technologies spread through a society. It is often slower than contagious diffusion and involves a series of steps where the innovation is gradually adopted by different segments of the population.\n\nD. **Hierarchical diffusion**: This refers to the spread of innovations through a structured hierarchy, such as through organizations or institutions. It is not typically associated with the global spread of fashion designs.\n\nGiven the context of a new fashion design being introduced globally, the most appropriate term is **contagious diffusion**. This is because the rapid and widespread adoption of new fashion trends is often due to a common influence or trend that spreads quickly across different regions and cultures.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Contagious diffusion",
