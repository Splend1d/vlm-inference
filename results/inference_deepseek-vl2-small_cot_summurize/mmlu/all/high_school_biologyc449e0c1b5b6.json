            "content": "To determine the nucleotide sequence of the tRNA anticodon, we need to understand the process of transcription and translation.\n\n1. **Transcription Process**: \n   - DNA is transcribed into mRNA. The DNA sequence is 5\u2032-C-A-T-3\u2032.\n   - During transcription, the DNA template is used to synthesize a complementary mRNA strand.\n   - The mRNA sequence is complementary to the DNA template, meaning it is the reverse complement of the DNA sequence.\n\n2. **mRNA Sequence**:\n   - The DNA sequence 5\u2032-C-A-T-3\u2032 is transcribed into mRNA as 5\u2032-G-A-U-3\u2032.\n\n3. **Translation Process**:\n   - The mRNA is translated into a protein. During translation, tRNA molecules bring amino acids to the ribosome based on the mRNA codon.\n   - Each tRNA has an anticodon that is complementary to the mRNA codon.\n\n4. **Anticodon Determination**:\n   - The mRNA codon is 5\u2032-G-A-U-3\u2032.\n   - The anticodon on the tRNA must be complementary to this mRNA codon.\n   - The complementary sequence to 5\u2032-G-A-U-3\u2032 is 3\u2032-C-A-T-5\u2032.\n\n5. **tRNA Anticodon**:\n   - The anticodon on the tRNA is 5\u2032-C-A-T-3\u2032.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 5\u2032-C-A-U-3\u2032.",
