Favors incumbent candidates over challengers: This is true. Gerrymandering can be used to protect incumbents by drawing district lines in a way that makes it difficult for challengers to win.\n\nB. Can divide like-minded voters into several districts to reduce their influence: This is true. Gerrymandering can be used to split up groups of voters who share similar political views, making it harder for them to elect candidates who share their views.\n\nC. Has been allowed by the Supreme Court in some instances: This is true. The Supreme Court has ruled that gerrymandering is constitutional as long as it is done in a way that does not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nD. Increases the control voters have over their elected officials: This is false. Gerrymandering is often used to concentrate power in the hands of one party or group, rather than giving voters more control over their elected officials.\n\nTherefore, the statement that is not true about gerrymandering is D. Increases the control voters have over their elected officials.",
