This is because the Lorentz transformation, which describes these effects, becomes more pronounced as the velocity approaches the speed of light.\n\nB. **At everyday low speeds.**\n   - At everyday speeds, which are much less than the speed of light, the effects of relativity are negligible. The equations for time dilation, length contraction, and relativistic momentum and energy do not hold true in this regime.\n\nC. **At all speeds.**\n   - This option is incorrect because relativistic effects are only significant at speeds close to the speed of light. At lower speeds, these effects are not noticeable.\n\nD. **Only approximately.**\n   - While relativistic effects can be approximated for speeds close to the speed of light, they are not \"only approximately\" true. The effects are exact and not approximate.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nA. At speeds near that of light.",
