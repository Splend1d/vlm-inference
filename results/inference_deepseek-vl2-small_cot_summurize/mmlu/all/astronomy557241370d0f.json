Iron**: Iron is present in the Earth's crust and in the cores of planets, but it is not the most abundant element in the solar system.\n   - **B. Hydrogen**: Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the solar system, making up about 75% of the Sun's mass.\n   - **C. Methane**: Methane is found in the atmospheres of some planets, but it is not the most common element.\n   - **D. Helium**: Helium is the second most abundant element in the solar system, making up about 25% of the Sun's mass.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given that hydrogen is the most abundant element, helium is the second most common element in the solar system.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **D. Helium**.",
