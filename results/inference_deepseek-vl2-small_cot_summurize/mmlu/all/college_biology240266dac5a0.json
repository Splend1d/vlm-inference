            "content": "To determine which tissue in an actively photosynthesizing plant would have the highest rate of oxygen production, we need to understand the role of each tissue in the plant's photosynthetic process.\n\n- **Cortex (Option A):** The cortex is the outermost layer of the plant, primarily involved in storage and support. It does not contain chloroplasts, which are essential for photosynthesis. Therefore, it does not contribute to oxygen production.\n\n- **Palisade mesophyll (Option B):** This is the inner layer of the leaves, consisting of closely packed cells with chloroplasts. These chloroplasts are the sites of photosynthesis, where carbon dioxide is converted into glucose and oxygen. The high concentration of chloroplasts in the palisade mesophyll allows it to produce a significant amount of oxygen.\n\n- **Epidermis (Option C):** The epidermis is the outermost layer of cells in the leaf, providing protection and reducing water loss. It does not contain chloroplasts and thus does not participate in photosynthesis.\n\n- **Vascular cambium (Option D):** This is a layer of cells responsible for the growth of secondary xylem and phloem. It is involved in the secondary growth of the plant but does not contain chloroplasts and therefore does not produce oxygen.\n\nConsidering the roles of each tissue, the palisade mesophyll is the tissue where photosynthesis occurs, and due to its high chloroplast density, it is the most efficient at producing oxygen.\n\nTherefore, the tissue with the highest rate of oxygen production in an actively photosynthesizing plant is the **palisade mesophyll (Option B)**.",
