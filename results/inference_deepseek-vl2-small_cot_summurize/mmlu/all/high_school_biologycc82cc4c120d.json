It is an organic compound made of proteins.\n- Trypsin is indeed an enzyme, which is a type of protein. Proteins are organic compounds composed of amino acids. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\nB. It is a catalyst that alters the rate of a reaction.\n- Enzymes, including trypsin, act as catalysts. They speed up chemical reactions by lowering the activation energy required for the reaction to occur. This statement is true.\n\nC. It is operative over a wide pH range.\n- Trypsin is an enzyme that functions optimally at a specific pH range, typically around pH 7.4. It is not operative over a wide pH range. This statement is false.\n\nD. The rate of catalysis is affected by the concentration of substrate.\n- The rate of enzyme-catalyzed reactions is indeed affected by the concentration of the substrate. As the substrate concentration increases, the rate of reaction typically increases, up to a certain point. This statement is true.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the statement that is NOT true about trypsin is:\n\nC. It is operative over a wide pH range.",
