China: China has been investing heavily in renewable energy, but the exact percentage of GDP invested in renewable energy in 2015 is not readily available. However, it is known that China has been a leader in renewable energy investment.\n\nB. Japan: Japan has also been investing in renewable energy, but the exact percentage of GDP invested in renewable energy in 2015 is not readily available. However, Japan has been a leader in renewable energy investment.\n\nC. Chile: Chile has been investing in renewable energy, but the exact percentage of GDP invested in renewable energy in 2015 is not readily available. However, Chile has been a leader in renewable energy investment.\n\nD. India: India has been investing in renewable energy, but the exact percentage of GDP invested in renewable energy in 2015 is not readily available. However, India has been a leader in renewable energy investment.\n\nBased on the available data, it is not possible to determine which country invested the largest fraction of its GDP in renewable energy in 2015. However, if we look at the data from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) for 2015, we can see that China, Japan, and India were among the top countries in terms of renewable energy investment as a percentage of GDP.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nA. China\nB. Japan\nC. India\nD. Chile\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the data may not be up-to-date, and the situation may have changed since 2015.",
