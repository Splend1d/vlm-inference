Peak flow meters are used to measure the maximum amount of air a person can exhale in one second. Accurate and consistent readings are crucial for diagnosing and monitoring respiratory conditions.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **10 litres per minute of each other**: This option suggests a relatively small range of variation. While it may be sufficient for some measurements, it might not be enough to capture the full range of possible peak flow values, especially in individuals with significant variability in their peak flow.\n\nB. **20 litres per minute of each other**: This option provides a moderate range of variation. It is more likely to capture the full range of peak flow values, including those with high variability, while still maintaining a manageable level of consistency.\n\nC. **100 litres per minute of each other**: This option suggests a very large range of variation. While it might be useful for identifying extreme values, it could also lead to inconsistencies in measurements, making it less reliable for diagnostic purposes.\n\nD. **30 litres per minute of each other**: This option is similar to option A but with a slightly larger range. It may still be too small to capture the full range of peak flow values, especially in individuals with significant variability.\n\nConsidering the need for a balance between capturing the full range of peak flow values and maintaining consistency, the most appropriate range is:\n\nB. **20 litres per minute of each other**. This range allows for the detection of both high and low values while ensuring that the measurements are consistent enough for reliable analysis.",
