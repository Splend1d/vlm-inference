            "content": "To determine who becomes the president if no candidate receives a majority of the electoral college vote, we need to understand the process of electing the president in the United States.\n\n1. **Understanding the Electoral College**: The Electoral College is a body of electors established by the U.S. Constitution. Each state is allocated a certain number of electoral votes based on its population, with a minimum of three. The candidate who wins the majority of the electoral votes (at least 270 out of 538) wins the presidency.\n\n2. **Majority Requirement**: If no candidate receives a majority of the electoral votes, the election is considered unresolved. This situation is known as a \"contingent election.\"\n\n3. **Role of the House of Representatives**: According to the 12th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, if no candidate receives a majority of the electoral votes, the House of Representatives is tasked with selecting the president. Each state delegation in the House gets one vote, and a candidate must receive a majority of the states' votes (at least 26) to win.\n\n4. **Process in the House**: The process begins with the House convening in a joint session. Members of the House cast their votes for president. The candidate who receives the majority of the states' votes is declared the winner.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Given this process, the correct answer is:\n\nD. The candidate who wins the majority of votes in the House.\n\nThis method ensures that the president is chosen by the legislative branch, maintaining the balance of power among the branches of government.",
