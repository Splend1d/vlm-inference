Some of the things included in M2 are not as liquid as the things in MI.\n- M1 includes currency and checking deposits, which are highly liquid. M2 includes M1 plus savings accounts, time deposits, and other less liquid assets. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\nB. M2 is smaller than MI.\n- M1 is a subset of M2. M2 includes all the components of M1 plus additional less liquid assets. Therefore, M2 is not smaller than M1. This statement is false.\n\nC. M1 is backed by gold and M2 is backed by silver.\n- M1 includes currency and checking deposits, which are not backed by any specific commodity. M2 includes M1 plus savings accounts, time deposits, and other less liquid assets, which are not backed by any specific commodity either. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nD. The biggest component of M1 is currency.\n- M1 includes currency and checking deposits. Currency is indeed a significant component of M1, but checking deposits are also a major component. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the true statement is:\n\nA. Some of the things included in M2 are not as liquid as the things in MI.",
