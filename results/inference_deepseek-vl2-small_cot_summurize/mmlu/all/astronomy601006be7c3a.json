The mission's primary objective was to study the Martian polar ice cap and search for signs of water ice. The lander was equipped with a robotic arm and a suite of scientific instruments designed to analyze the soil and ice at the Martian surface.\n\nThe Phoenix Mars Lander was designed to dig into the Martian soil to a depth of about 20 centimeters (8 inches) to search for water ice. The mission's findings were significant, as they provided evidence of water ice at the Martian poles and in the upper layers of the soil. The mission concluded on November 10, 2008, when communication with the lander was lost.",
