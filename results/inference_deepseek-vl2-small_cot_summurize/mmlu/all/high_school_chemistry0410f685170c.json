The carbonyl group is a functional group that includes oxygen. Therefore, aldehydes do contain oxygen.\n\nB. **An alkane**: Alkanes are hydrocarbons that consist entirely of carbon and hydrogen atoms with single bonds between them. They do not contain any oxygen atoms. Therefore, alkanes do not contain oxygen.\n\nC. **An alcohol**: Alcohols are organic compounds that contain a hydroxyl group (-OH) bonded to a carbon atom. The hydroxyl group includes an oxygen atom. Therefore, alcohols do contain oxygen.\n\nD. **An ether**: Ethers are organic compounds that contain an oxygen atom connected to two alkyl or aryl groups. Therefore, ethers do contain oxygen.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, we can conclude that the compound that does not contain oxygen is:\n\nB. An alkane.",
