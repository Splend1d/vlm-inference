            "content": "To determine how long it takes Pluto to orbit the Sun once, we need to consider the orbital period of Pluto. Pluto's orbit is highly elliptical, and its distance from the Sun varies significantly.\n\n1. **Understanding Pluto's Orbit**: Pluto's orbit is not a perfect circle but an ellipse. This means that Pluto moves faster when it is closer to the Sun and slower when it is farther away.\n\n2. **Orbital Period Calculation**: The orbital period of a planet is the time it takes to complete one full orbit around the Sun. For Pluto, this period is approximately 248 Earth years.\n\n3. **Factors Affecting Orbital Period**: The elliptical shape of Pluto's orbit means that its distance from the Sun changes over time. This affects the speed of its orbit.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Given that Pluto's orbital period is about 248 Earth years, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 250 years\n\nThis calculation considers the elliptical nature of Pluto's orbit and the time it takes for Pluto to complete one full orbit around the Sun.",
