They are the fiercest competitors in the area.\n- This statement is incorrect. The first colonizers are often pioneer species, which are not necessarily the fiercest competitors. Instead, they are adapted to the harsh conditions of the new environment and can survive in less hospitable conditions.\n\nB. They maintain the habitat as it is for their own kind.\n- This statement is incorrect. The primary role of pioneer species is not to maintain the habitat as it is but to change it. They help to break down existing structures and create conditions that are more suitable for other species to follow.\n\nC. They change the habitat in a way that makes it more habitable for other organisms.\n- This statement is correct. Pioneer species are crucial in ecological succession because they alter the environment, making it more suitable for subsequent species. For example, they might break down rocks, create soil, or alter the climate, which can lead to the development of more complex ecosystems.\n\nD. They are small invertebrates.\n- This statement is incorrect. While pioneer species can include small invertebrates, they are not limited to them. Pioneer species can also be plants, fungi, or even bacteria, depending on the specific ecological context.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. They change the habitat in a way that makes it more habitable for other organisms.",
