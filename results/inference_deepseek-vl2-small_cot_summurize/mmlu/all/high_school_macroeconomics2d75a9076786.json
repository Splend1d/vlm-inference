            "content": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option in the context of GDP (Gross Domestic Product) and the components of GDP:\n\n1. **GDP Definition**: GDP is the total value of all goods and services produced within a country's borders in a specific time period. It is calculated using the expenditure approach, which sums up consumption (C), investment (I), government spending (G), and net exports (exports minus imports).\n\n2. **Components of GDP**:\n   - **Consumption (C)**: Includes all private consumption expenditures, such as household spending on goods and services.\n   - **Investment (I)**: Includes business investments in capital goods, residential construction, and changes in business inventories.\n   - **Government Spending (G)**: Includes government expenditures on goods and services.\n   - **Net Exports (NX)**: Exports minus imports.\n\n3. **Analysis of the Scenario**:\n   - XYZ Corporation buys an original Matisse painting, which is a good or service.\n   - This purchase is a transaction involving the sale of a product, which is a part of consumption.\n\n4. **Impact on GDP Components**:\n   - **Consumption (C)**: When a company like XYZ Corporation buys a painting, it is considered a part of business investment in art, which is included in the investment component (I).\n   - **Investment (I)**: Since the painting is a new purchase, it increases the investment in art, thus increasing the investment component of GDP.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The purchase of the painting by XYZ Corporation increases the investment component of GDP.\n   - Therefore, the correct answer is that GDP increases by the amount of the purchase because investment (I) increases.\n\nThus, the correct answer is **B. GDP increases by the amount of the purchase because I increases.**",
