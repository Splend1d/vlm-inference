The total current in the circuit is the sum of the currents through each component.\n\nWhen more lamps are added in parallel, the total resistance of the circuit decreases because the equivalent resistance of parallel resistors is less than the smallest individual resistance. According to Ohm's Law (\\( V = IR \\)), if the voltage remains constant and the resistance decreases, the current must increase.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. increases",
