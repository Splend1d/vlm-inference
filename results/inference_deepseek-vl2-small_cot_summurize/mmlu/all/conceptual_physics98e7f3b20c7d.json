Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n\n\\[ \\Delta p = F \\cdot \\Delta t \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( \\Delta p \\) is the change in momentum,\n- \\( F \\) is the force applied,\n- \\( \\Delta t \\) is the time over which the force is applied.\n\nThis relationship is derived from Newton's second law, which states that the force acting on an object is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by its acceleration (\\( F = ma \\)). When the force is applied over a period of time, the change in momentum (\\( \\Delta p \\)) is given by:\n\n\\[ \\Delta p = F \\cdot \\Delta t \\]\n\nThus, the impulse\u2013momentum relationship is a direct consequence of Newton's second law.",
