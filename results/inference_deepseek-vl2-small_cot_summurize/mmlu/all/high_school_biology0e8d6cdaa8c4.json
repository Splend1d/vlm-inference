            "content": "To determine which of the options is an example of a cline, we need to understand what a cline is. A cline is a gradual change in a particular trait or characteristic across a geographic area or ecological niche. This change is typically associated with environmental gradients, such as temperature, altitude, or moisture.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. The hybrid tomato plant is stronger and produces better fruit than the pure genotype.\n- This statement describes a specific trait (fruit production) in a hybrid plant compared to its pure genotype. However, it does not indicate a gradual change across a geographic area or ecological niche. Therefore, it is not an example of a cline.\n\nB. There are two distinct varieties in one population of snail that inhabits an island in the Pacific Ocean.\n- This statement describes two distinct varieties within the same population, which suggests genetic variation but does not indicate a gradual change across a geographic area. Thus, it is not an example of a cline.\n\nC. Males of some species have long antlers to fight other males for females.\n- This statement describes a trait (antlers) that may vary among males of a species, but it does not indicate a gradual change across a geographic area or ecological niche. Therefore, it is not an example of a cline.\n\nD. In one species of rabbit, the ones that evolved in the cold, snowy north are white, while the ones that evolved in the south are brown.\n- This statement describes a gradual change in fur coloration across a geographic area, which is a classic example of a cline. The environmental gradient here is temperature, leading to a change in fur coloration.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the correct answer is:\n\nD. In one species of rabbit, the ones that evolved in the cold, snowy north are white, while the ones that evolved in the south are brown.",
