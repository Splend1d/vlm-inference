Let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Who will get how much of each good and service?**\n   - This question addresses the distribution of goods and services, which is a key aspect of economic theory. It involves understanding how resources are allocated in an economy and how income is distributed among individuals. This is a fundamental question because it touches on the core issues of fairness, efficiency, and economic stability.\n\nB. **Who should pay taxes?**\n   - This question is more about tax policy and fiscal responsibility. While it is an important economic issue, it is not a fundamental question in the sense that it does not address the underlying principles of how an economy functions.\n\nC. **Who will work?**\n   - This question relates to labor economics and employment patterns. It is important for understanding labor market dynamics, but it does not delve into the fundamental principles of how an economy operates.\n\nD. **Who will make the economic decisions?**\n   - This question is about the role of individuals, firms, and governments in making economic choices. While it is crucial for understanding economic activity, it does not address the foundational principles of economic theory.\n\nAfter evaluating each option, the question that is most fundamental in the sense of seeking to understand the core principles of economic behavior is:\n\n**A. Who will get how much of each good and service?**",
