            "content": "To determine how the length of a strip of iron changes with temperature, we need to consider the properties of iron and the concept of thermal expansion.\n\n1. **Understanding Thermal Expansion**: Thermal expansion is the tendency of matter to change in volume in response to a change in temperature. For most materials, including iron, this means that as the temperature increases, the material expands.\n\n2. **Material Properties of Iron**: Iron is a metal, and metals generally expand uniformly when heated. This means that the length of the strip of iron will increase as the temperature rises.\n\n3. **Analyzing the Options**:\n   - **Option A: Also increases.** This is consistent with the principle of thermal expansion. As the temperature of the iron strip increases, its length will increase.\n   - **Option B: Actually decreases.** This contradicts the principle of thermal expansion, as it would imply that the strip contracts when heated, which is not typical for metals.\n   - **Option C: May increase and may decrease.** This is not accurate because the length of the strip will not decrease with an increase in temperature.\n   - **Option D: Decreases in width as it gets longer.** This is unrelated to the question about length and temperature.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Given the properties of iron and the concept of thermal expansion, the correct answer is that the length of the strip of iron will increase as the temperature increases.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **A. also increases**.",
