Each group has specific duties and responsibilities within the society.\n\nA. Scholar-priests (Brahmins) are considered the highest caste in Hinduism. They are responsible for religious rituals, teaching, and maintaining the sacred texts.\n\nB. Warrior-landowners (Kshatriyas) are the second-highest caste. They are typically involved in military service and the management of land.\n\nC. Businessmen and farmers (Vaishyas) are the third-highest caste. They are involved in trade, commerce, and agriculture.\n\nD. Untouchables (Shudras) are not part of the traditional caste system. They are considered to be outside the four main castes and are often involved in menial labor. However, it's important to note that the concept of untouchability is a social and cultural construct that has been challenged and is not officially recognized in modern India.\n\nTherefore, the group that is excluded from the traditional caste system of Hinduism is:\n\nD.
