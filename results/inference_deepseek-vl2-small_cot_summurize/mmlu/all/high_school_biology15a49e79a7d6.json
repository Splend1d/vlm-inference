            "content": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option in the context of neuron membrane potential changes:\n\nA. **Depolarization**: This occurs when the membrane potential becomes less negative, moving towards a more positive value. In this case, the membrane potential changes from +50 mV to -70 mV, which is a more negative value. Therefore, this is not depolarization.\n\nB. **Repolarization**: This is the process by which the membrane potential returns to its resting state after an action potential. The change from +50 mV to -70 mV is a significant shift in the opposite direction, indicating that the neuron is not returning to its resting state.\n\nC. **Hyperpolarization**: This occurs when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. The change from +50 mV to -70 mV is indeed more negative, indicating that the neuron is hyperpolarized.\n\nD. **An action potential**: This is a rapid change in membrane potential that travels along the axon of a neuron. The change from +50 mV to -70 mV is a change in membrane potential, but it does not specify the rapid and transient nature of an action potential.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Hyperpolarization\n\nThe neuron's membrane potential changes from +50 mV to -70 mV, indicating that it is hyperpolarized.",
