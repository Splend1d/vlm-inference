Alpha particles are not electrons; they are much larger and have a positive charge.\n\nB. Another name for a helium nucleus: This is correct. An alpha particle is essentially a helium nucleus, which consists of two protons and two neutrons. The term \"alpha particle\" is often used to describe this specific type of particle.\n\nC. Another name for a positron: A positron is the antiparticle of an electron, with a positive charge. Alpha particles are not positrons; they are composed of protons and neutrons.\n\nD. Another name for a cosmic ray: Cosmic rays are high-energy particles that originate from outside the Earth's atmosphere. While alpha particles can be found in cosmic rays, the term \"alpha particle\" specifically refers to the helium nucleus.\n\nAfter evaluating each option, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Another name for a helium nucleus.",
