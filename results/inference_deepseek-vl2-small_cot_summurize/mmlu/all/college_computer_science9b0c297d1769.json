However, if we consider the question's intent, it might be looking for a pair that, when added, results in a value that is just below the maximum value, which would indicate a potential overflow. In this case, none of the options meet that criterion.\n\nHowever, if we were to interpret the question as looking for a pair that, when added, results in a value that is just below the maximum value, we would still not have an overflow because the result is less than the maximum value.\n\nGiven the options and the nature of the question, it seems there might be a misunderstanding or a need for clarification in the question itself.\n\nHowever, based on the calculations provided, none of the options result in overflow.\n\nThe answer is:\n\\[ \\text{None} \\]",
