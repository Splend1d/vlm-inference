            "content": "To determine which option is correct, let's analyze each choice:\n\nA. The light reactions provide oxygen for the light-independent reactions.\n- The light reactions of photosynthesis primarily involve the splitting of water molecules to produce oxygen, but this oxygen is released into the atmosphere, not used in the Calvin cycle. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\nB. ATP and NADPH provide the power and raw materials for the Calvin cycle.\n- The light reactions generate ATP and NADPH, which are crucial for the Calvin cycle. ATP provides the energy, while NADPH supplies the reducing power needed to convert carbon dioxide into glucose. This option is correct.\n\nC. Water entering the plant through the roots provides hydrogen directly to the Calvin cycle.\n- Water enters the plant through the roots, but it is not hydrogen. Instead, hydrogen is produced during the light reactions when water is split. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\nD. CO2 released by the light-dependent reactions provides the raw material for the Calvin cycle.\n- CO2 is not a product of the light-dependent reactions; it is a reactant in the Calvin cycle. The Calvin cycle uses CO2 to produce glucose. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\nAfter evaluating each option, the correct answer is:\n\nB. ATP and NADPH provide the power and raw materials for the Calvin cycle.",
