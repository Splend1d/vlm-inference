This power was reserved for the federal government, which was responsible for issuing currency.\n\nB. **Authorizing constitutional amendments**: The Articles of Confederation did not have the power to authorize constitutional amendments. This power is reserved for the Constitution, which allows for amendments through a specific process.\n\nC. **Having representation in Congress**: The Articles of Confederation granted each state two representatives in Congress, regardless of its population. This was a significant limitation because it did not provide proportional representation, which is a key feature of the Constitution.\n\nD. **Appealing to the president to adjudicate disputes**: The Articles of Confederation did not provide a mechanism for states to appeal disputes to the president. This power is part of the Constitution, where the Supreme Court serves as the final arbiter of disputes.\n\nAfter evaluating each option, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Having representation in Congress\n\nThe Articles of Confederation did not provide proportional representation, which is a fundamental difference from the Constitution.",
