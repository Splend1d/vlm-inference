            "content": "To determine which statement is true, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. It is used to call procedures with addresses that are farther than 2^16 bytes away.\n- Remote Procedure Call (RPC) is a mechanism that allows a program to execute procedures (functions) on another address space (commonly on another computer on a shared network). The maximum distance that can be covered by an RPC call is limited by the size of the address space, which is typically 2^16 bytes (65,536 bytes) on most systems. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\nB. It cannot return a value.\n- This statement is false. RPC calls can return values. The return value is passed back to the calling program, similar to how local procedure calls return values.\n\nC. It cannot pass parameters by reference.\n- This statement is false. RPC calls can pass parameters by reference. In fact, passing parameters by reference is a common practice in RPC to allow the called procedure to modify the original data.\n\nD. It cannot call procedures implemented in a different language.\n- This statement is false. RPC is designed to be language-agnostic. Procedures can be implemented in different languages, and RPC allows them to be called across language boundaries.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the correct answer is:\n\nA. It is used to call procedures with addresses that are farther than 2^16 bytes away.",
