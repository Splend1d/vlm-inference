Results are often reproducible: Penetration testing can be repeated to verify the results, ensuring that the findings are consistent and reliable.\n\nB. Full evidence of security: A clean test means a secure system: Penetration testing can provide concrete evidence of security vulnerabilities, helping organizations to understand the security posture of their systems.\n\nC. Compositionality of security properties means tested components are secure even if others change: Penetration testing can help identify security vulnerabilities in individual components, even if other components change, ensuring that the overall system remains secure.\n\nD. Makes an adversarial neural network converge more quickly: Penetration testing is not related to the convergence of an adversarial neural network. This option is not a benefit of penetration testing.",
