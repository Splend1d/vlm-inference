The nuclear shell model is an extension of the electron shell model to nuclei, where the energy levels are determined by the number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus.\n\nFor a given atomic number (Z), the number of allowed energy levels is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ N = 2Z + 2 \\]\n\nwhere \\( N \\) is the number of allowed energy levels.\n\nFor the 55Mn nuclide, the atomic number \\( Z \\) is 25 (since Mn has 25 protons). Plugging this into the formula, we get:\n\n\\[ N = 2(25) + 2 \\]\n\\[ N = 50 + 2 \\]\n\\[ N = 52 \\]\n\nHowever, this result is not one of the options provided. Let's re-evaluate the problem.
