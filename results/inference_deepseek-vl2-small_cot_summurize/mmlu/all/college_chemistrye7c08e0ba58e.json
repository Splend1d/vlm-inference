            "content": "To calculate the magnetic field responsible for the polarization of 2.5 x 10^-6 for 13C at 298 K, we need to use the formula for the magnetic field strength (B) in a magnetic field (B0) and the magnetic susceptibility (\u03c7) of the material. The formula is:\n\nB = B0 * \u03c7\n\nwhere B0 is the magnetic field strength, and \u03c7 is the magnetic susceptibility.\n\nThe magnetic susceptibility (\u03c7) of 13C at 298 K is given by:\n\n\u03c7 = \u03c70 + (\u03c71 * T) + (\u03c72 * T^2)\n\nwhere \u03c70 is the zero-field susceptibility, \u03c71 is the first-order coefficient, and \u03c72 is the second-order coefficient.\n\nThe zero-field susceptibility (\u03c70) of 13C is approximately 2.5 x 10^-6. The first-order coefficient (\u03c71) is approximately 0.000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
