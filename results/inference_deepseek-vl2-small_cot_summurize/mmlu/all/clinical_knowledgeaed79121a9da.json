Water intake is less than is needed to maintain balance.\n- This option suggests that the body is not consuming enough water to maintain its normal water balance. This would typically lead to dehydration, not hypernatraemia.\n\nB. Water intake is more than is needed to maintain balance.\n- This option indicates that the body is consuming more water than necessary. In the context of hypernatraemia, this means that the body is retaining more water than it should, leading to an elevated sodium concentration in the blood. This is consistent with the definition of hypernatraemia.\n\nC. Blood volume is lost due to trauma or burns.\n- This option describes a situation where blood volume is lost, which can lead to hypovolemic shock. This is not related to hypernatraemia, which involves excess water retention.\n\nD. Blood volume is lost due to surgery.\n- Similar to option C, this describes a loss of blood volume, which can result in hypovolemic shock. This is unrelated to hypernatraemia.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Water intake is more than is needed to maintain balance.\n\nThis option correctly describes hypernatraemia, where the body retains more water than it should, leading to an elevated sodium concentration in the blood.",
