            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of proportional enlargement. When a figure is enlarged proportionally, the ratio of the lengths of corresponding sides remains the same.\n\nLet's denote the original length of the picture as \\( L_1 \\) and the new length as \\( L_2 \\).\n\nGiven:\n- The original width \\( W_1 = 4 \\) cm\n- The original length \\( L_1 = 6 \\) cm\n- The new width \\( W_2 = 10 \\) cm\n\nWe need to find the new length \\( L_2 \\).\n\nSince the picture is enlarged proportionally, the ratio of the new width to the original width is equal to the ratio of the new length to the original length:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{W_2}{W_1} = \\frac{L_2}{L_1}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{10}{4} = \\frac{L_2}{6}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the left side of the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5}{2} = \\frac{L_2}{6}\n\\]\n\nTo solve for \\( L_2 \\), we cross-multiply:\n\n\\[\n5 \\times 6 = 2 \\times L_2\n\\]\n\n\\[\n30 = 2L_2\n\\]\n\nDividing both sides by 2:\n\n\\[\nL_2 = \\frac{30}{2} = 15\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the length of the new, larger picture is 15 cm.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nC. 15 cm",
