            "content": "To determine the primary purpose of \"motor voter\" laws, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. To increase turnout on election days: While increasing voter turnout is a desirable outcome, the primary purpose of \"motor voter\" laws is not directly related to turnout. These laws aim to simplify the registration process rather than directly influence voter participation.\n\nB. To make it easier for citizens to register to vote: This is the correct answer. \"Motor voter\" laws are designed to streamline the voter registration process by allowing citizens to register to vote at the same time they apply for or renew their driver's license. This reduces the administrative burden on state and local election officials and makes it more convenient for eligible citizens to register.\n\nC. To require that all voters know how to drive: This option is unrelated to the purpose of \"motor voter\" laws. The laws do not require voters to know how to drive; rather, they facilitate the registration process for those who do.\n\nD. To establish voter identification laws: While voter identification laws are important for ensuring the integrity of elections, \"motor voter\" laws are not primarily about establishing these laws. Instead, they focus on simplifying the registration process.\n\nTherefore, the primary purpose of \"motor voter\" laws is to make it easier for citizens to register to vote. The correct answer is B.",
