They do not transmit impulses; instead, they gather and integrate information.\n\nB. Glial cell: Glial cells are non-neuronal cells in the nervous system that provide support and protection for neurons. They do not transmit impulses.\n\nC. Nerve center: A nerve center, or ganglion, is a cluster of neurons that can transmit impulses. However, it is not the point where impulses are transmitted between neurons.\n\nD. Synapse: A synapse is the junction between two neurons where the transmission of impulses occurs. It is the site where neurotransmitters are released from the presynaptic neuron and bind to receptors on the postsynaptic neuron, facilitating the transmission of the nerve impulse.\n\nAfter evaluating each option, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Synapse\n\nThe synapse is the critical point at which an impulse is transmitted from one neuron to another, enabling communication within the nervous system.",
