            "content": "To determine the most likely outcome of a forest devastated by fire, we need to consider the ecological processes involved in succession and the resilience of different species.\n\n- **Option A: Only animal life would continue to inhabit the region.**\n  - While animals might return to the area, they would not be the primary occupants. The forest ecosystem relies on plant life for oxygen production, soil stabilization, and habitat provision. Therefore, animal life alone would not sustain the ecosystem.\n\n- **Option B: Secondary succession would begin to occur.**\n  - Secondary succession occurs in areas where a disturbance has destroyed an existing ecosystem but left the soil intact. This process involves the colonization of pioneer species, which are adapted to the disturbed environment. In the case of a forest fire, the soil remains, and the fire-killed trees provide a substrate for new plant growth. Pioneer species such as grasses, shrubs, and small trees would begin to colonize the area, leading to the development of a new forest ecosystem.\n\n- **Option C: Only tough grasses would appear.**\n  - While tough grasses might be among the first to colonize the area, they would not be the only species. The ecosystem would likely support a variety of plant species, including shrubs and small trees, as the soil conditions improve and the ecosystem matures.\n\n- **Option D: The number of species would stabilize as the ecosystem matures.**\n  - While the number of species might stabilize over time, the initial phase of succession involves a dynamic process where species diversity increases as the ecosystem develops. Therefore, this option does not accurately describe the immediate aftermath of a fire.\n\nConsidering these analyses, the most likely outcome is that **secondary succession would begin to occur**. This is because the fire has destroyed the existing forest, leaving the soil intact and providing a substrate for new plant growth. The correct answer is **B**.",
