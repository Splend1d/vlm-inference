            "content": "To determine the number of chromosomes in the cells after meiosis, we need to understand the process of meiosis and its impact on chromosome number.\n\nMeiosis is a type of cell division that reduces the chromosome number by half, resulting in the production of gametes (sperm and egg cells). This process involves two rounds of division: meiosis I and meiosis II.\n\n1. **Initial Chromosome Number**: The organism has a diploid chromosome number of 96. This means that each cell contains 96 chromosomes.\n\n2. **First Meiotic Division (Meiosis I)**: During meiosis I, homologous chromosomes are separated. This results in the formation of two haploid cells, each with half the original number of chromosomes. Therefore, each of these cells will have 96/2 = 48 chromosomes.\n\n3. **Second Meiotic Division (Meiosis II)**: In meiosis II, sister chromatids are separated, resulting in four haploid cells. Each of these cells will have 48 chromosomes.\n\nThus, after meiosis, the organism\u2019s cells will have 48 chromosomes.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 48",
