            "content": "To determine the duty cycle of a step-up chopper, we need to understand the relationship between the input voltage, output voltage, and the duty cycle.\n\nThe duty cycle (\\(D\\)) of a chopper is defined as the ratio of the time the switch is on to the total time the switch is on and off. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ D = \\frac{t_{\\text{on}}}{t_{\\text{total}}} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( t_{\\text{on}} \\) is the time the switch is on.\n- \\( t_{\\text{total}} \\) is the total time the switch is on and off.\n\nFor a step-up chopper, the duty cycle is given by:\n\n\\[ D = \\frac{V_{\\text{out}}}{V_{\\text{in}}} \\]\n\nGiven:\n- \\( V_{\\text{in}} = 110 \\, \\text{V} \\)\n- \\( V_{\\text{out}} = 150 \\, \\text{V} \\)\n\nSubstituting these values into the duty cycle formula:\n\n\\[ D = \\frac{150 \\, \\text{V}}{110 \\, \\text{V}} \\]\n\nCalculating the duty cycle:\n\n\\[ D = \\frac{150}{110} \\approx 1.3636 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the duty cycle is approximately 1.36.\n\nHowever, the options provided do not include 1.36. Let's re-evaluate the options given:\n\nA. 0.32\nB. 0.67\nC. 0.45\nD. 0.27\n\nNone of these options match the calculated duty cycle of approximately 1.36. It seems there might be a misunderstanding or error in the options provided. Based on the calculation, the duty cycle should be approximately 1.36, which is not listed among the options.\n\nGiven the options, none of them accurately represent the calculated duty cycle. Therefore, the correct answer based on the calculation is approximately 1.36, but it is not listed among the provided options.",
