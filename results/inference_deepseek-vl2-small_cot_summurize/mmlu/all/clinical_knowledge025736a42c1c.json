            "content": "Let's analyze each option to determine which statement is true about the spine:\n\nA. Back pain is an uncommon complaint: This statement is false. Back pain is one of the most common complaints and is a significant reason for medical consultations. It can arise from various causes, including musculoskeletal issues, poor posture, or underlying medical conditions.\n\nB. Schober's test is designed to quantify the flexion of the lumbar spine: This statement is true. Schober's test is a clinical examination used to assess the flexibility of the lumbar spine. It involves measuring the distance between the spinous processes of the L4 and L5 vertebrae when the patient is standing with their arms extended overhead. A greater distance indicates increased lumbar spine flexibility.\n\nC. Ankylosing spondylitis is a cause of hypermobility of the spine: This statement is false. Ankylosing spondylitis is a type of arthritis that primarily affects the spine and the sacroiliac joints, leading to inflammation and eventual fusion of the vertebrae. It is characterized by reduced flexibility and increased stiffness, not hypermobility.\n\nD. Pregnancy is a cause of loss of lordosis of the lumbar spine: This statement is false. During pregnancy, the lumbar spine often experiences increased lordosis, which is the natural curvature of the spine. This change is due to the weight of the growing fetus and hormonal changes.\n\nAfter evaluating each option, the correct answer is B. Schober's test is designed to quantify the flexion of the lumbar spine.",
