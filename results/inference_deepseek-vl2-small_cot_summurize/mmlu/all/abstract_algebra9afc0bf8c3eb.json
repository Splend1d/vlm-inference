            "content": "To determine the truth of the statements, let's analyze each one step by step.\n\n**Statement 1: The homomorphic image of a cyclic group is cyclic.**\n\nA cyclic group is a group that can be generated by a single element. Let's denote this element by \\( g \\). The cyclic group \\( \\mathbb{Z}_n \\) generated by \\( g \\) is defined as:\n\\[ \\mathbb{Z}_n = \\{0, 1, 2, \\ldots, n-1\\} \\]\n\nIf we consider the homomorphic image of this cyclic group under a homomorphism \\( \\phi \\), we need to understand how \\( \\phi \\) affects the group structure. A homomorphism \\( \\phi: \\mathbb{Z}_n \\to \\mathbb{Z}_m \\) maps each element \\( i \\) in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_n \\) to \\( \\phi(i) \\) in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_m \\).\n\nThe image of the generator \\( g \\) under \\( \\phi \\) is \\( \\phi(g) \\). If \\( \\phi \\) is injective (one-to-one), then \\( \\phi(g) \\) is a generator of the image group. However, if \\( \\phi \\) is not injective, the image group may not be cyclic.\n\nFor example, consider the homomorphism \\( \\phi: \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\to \\mathbb{Z}_4 \\) defined by \\( \\phi(0) = 0 \\) and \\( \\phi(1) = 2 \\). The image of the generator \\( g = 1 \\) under \\( \\phi \\) is \\( \\phi(1) = 2 \\). The image group is \\( \\{0, 2\\} \\), which is cyclic with generator \\( 2 \\).\n\nHowever, if \\( \\phi \\) is not injective, the image group may not be cyclic. For instance, consider the homomorphism \\( \\phi: \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\to \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\) defined by \\( \\phi(0) = 0 \\) and \\( \\phi(1) = 1 \\). The image of the generator \\( g = 1 \\) under \\( \\phi \\) is \\( \\phi(1) = 1 \\). The image group is \\( \\{0, 1\\} \\), which is cyclic with generator \\( 1 \\).\n\nThus, the statement that the homomorphic image of a cyclic group is always cyclic is not necessarily true. Therefore, Statement 1 is false.\n\n**Statement 2: The homomorphic image of an Abelian group is Abelian.**\n\nAn Abelian group is a group in which the group operation is commutative, i.e., for all elements \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) in the group, \\( a \\cdot b = b \\cdot a \\).\n\nIf \\( G \\) is an Abelian group and \\( \\phi: G \\to H \\) is a homomorphism, then the image of \\( G \\) under \\( \\phi \\) is also Abelian. This is because the commutativity of the group operation is preserved under the homomorphism.\n\nFor example, consider the Abelian group \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) (the group of integers under addition) and the homomorphism \\( \\phi: \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\) defined by \\( \\phi(n) = n \\mod 2 \\). The image of \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) under \\( \\phi \\) is \\( \\{0, 1\\} \\), which is Abelian.\n\nThus, the statement that the homomorphic image of an Abelian group is Abelian is true. Therefore, Statement 2 is true.\n\nGiven the analysis:\n- Statement 1 is false.\n- Statement 2 is true.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{D}\n\\]",
