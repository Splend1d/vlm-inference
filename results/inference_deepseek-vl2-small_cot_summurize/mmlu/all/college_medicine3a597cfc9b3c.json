            "content": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Corpus luteum, self-maintenance**: The corpus luteum is a temporary endocrine structure in the ovary that forms after ovulation and is responsible for secreting hormones like progesterone and estrogen. These hormones are crucial for maintaining the uterine lining (endometrium) for a potential pregnancy. However, the question specifically asks about the tissue that secretes B-hCG, not the corpus luteum's role in maintaining the endometrium.\n\nB. **Endometrium, cell division**: The endometrium is the lining of the uterus. While it is involved in preparing for a potential pregnancy by thickening, it is not the tissue that secretes B-hCG. The endometrium's role is more related to the preparation of the uterine environment rather than hormone secretion.\n\nC. **Blastocyst, increase in blood flow**: The blastocyst is the stage of embryonic development following the initial cell divisions. It is not involved in hormone secretion. The increase in blood flow is related to the placenta's development, which is responsible for nutrient and gas exchange, not hormone secretion.\n\nD. **Blastocyst, corpus luteum maintenance**: The blastocyst is the stage of embryonic development that forms after the initial cell divisions. It is the blastocyst that secretes B-hCG, which is crucial for maintaining the corpus luteum. The corpus luteum, in turn, secretes hormones like progesterone and estrogen, which are essential for sustaining the endometrium and supporting early pregnancy.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **D. Blastocyst, corpus luteum maintenance**. The blastocyst is responsible for secreting B-hCG, which is then used by the corpus luteum to maintain the endometrium and support early pregnancy.",
