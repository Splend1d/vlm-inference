It does not reabsorb glucose; instead, it allows water, ions, and small molecules to pass through.\n\n2. **Proximal Convoluted Tubule (PCT)**: This is the first segment of the nephron where reabsorption begins. It reabsorbs a significant amount of water, ions, and nutrients, including glucose, from the filtrate. The PCT is highly selective and reabsorbs about 65-70% of the glucose that is filtered.\n\n3. **Loop of Henle**: This segment is responsible for concentrating urine by reabsorbing water and salts. It does not reabsorb glucose.\n\n4. **Collecting Duct**: This is the final segment of the nephron where water is reabsorbed to form urine. It does not reabsorb glucose.\n\nGiven this analysis, the primary site of glucose reabsorption is the **proximal convoluted tubule (B)**. This is because the PCT is the first site where glucose is reabsorbed from the filtrate, making it the primary site for glucose reabsorption in the nephron.",
