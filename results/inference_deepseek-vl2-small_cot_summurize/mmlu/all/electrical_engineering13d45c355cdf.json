Passive elements are components that do not consume power and only allow current to flow through them. They include resistors, capacitors, inductors, and transformers.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Resistor: A resistor is a passive component. It resists the flow of electric current, which means it does not consume power. It is used to control the current and voltage in a circuit.\n\nB. Bulb: A bulb is an example of a passive component. It does not consume power and only allows current to flow through it when it is illuminated.\n\nC. Both: Since both the resistor and the bulb are passive components, this option is correct.\n\nD. None of these: This option is incorrect because both the resistor and the bulb are passive elements.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Both.",
