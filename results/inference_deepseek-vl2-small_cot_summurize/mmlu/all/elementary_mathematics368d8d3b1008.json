This means that for every 3 white cars, there are 5 blue cars.\n\nIf the company makes 15 white cars, we can find out how many blue cars it will make by setting up a proportion:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5 \\text{ blue cars}}{3 \\text{ white cars}} = \\frac{x \\text{ blue cars}}{15 \\text{ white cars}}\n\\]\n\nCross-multiplying, we get:\n\n\\[\n5 \\times 15 = 3 \\times x\n\\]\n\n\\[\n75 = 3x\n\\]\n\nDividing both sides by 3, we get:\n\n\\[\nx = 25\n\\]\n\nSo, the company will make 25 blue cars.\n\nThe answer is:\n\n\\[\nD\n\\]",
