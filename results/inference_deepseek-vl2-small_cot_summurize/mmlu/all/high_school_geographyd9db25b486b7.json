Mediterranean climate: While the Mediterranean climate is characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters, it is not the primary factor for early settlements. The climate does support agriculture, but it is not the main reason for settlement along coastlines and rivers.\n\nB. Limited forest cover: Limited forest cover can indeed influence settlement patterns, as it provides more open land for agriculture and construction. However, this factor alone does not explain the concentration of settlements along coastlines and rivers.\n\nC. Growth of manufacturing: The growth of manufacturing is more associated with industrialization and urbanization, which occurred later in history. Early settlements were not primarily driven by manufacturing.\n\nD. Access to trade routes: Access to trade routes is a significant factor in the early development of settlements. Coastal and riverine areas provided natural pathways for trade, allowing for the exchange of goods, ideas, and cultures. This access facilitated economic growth and the establishment of communities, leading to higher population densities.\n\nConsidering these factors, the best explanation for early settlements and high population density along coastlines and rivers is:\n\nD. Access to trade routes.",
