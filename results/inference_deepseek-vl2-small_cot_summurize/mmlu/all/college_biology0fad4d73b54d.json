            "content": "To determine the correct statement, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. During contraction H zones become elongated.\n- In a striated muscle, the H zone is the region between two adjacent A bands where actin filaments are not overlapped by myosin. During contraction, the actin filaments slide over myosin, causing the H zone to shorten, not elongate. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\nB. In the relaxed position tropomyosin impedes myosin's access to the binding site of actin.\n- In the relaxed state, tropomyosin is positioned over the binding sites on actin filaments, preventing myosin heads from binding to actin. This is a correct statement.\n\nC. Each myosin helical tail contains an actinbinding site and an ATP-hydrolyzing site.\n- Myosin heads have two main functions: binding to actin and hydrolyzing ATP to produce energy for muscle contraction. The ATP-hydrolyzing site is located at the C-terminal end of the myosin head, not within the helical tail. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\nD. The proteins troponin and tropomyosin constitute the thick and thin filaments, respectively.\n- Troponin is a complex of three proteins that regulate the interaction between actin and myosin, while tropomyosin is a single protein that covers the binding sites on actin filaments. Troponin is not a component of the filaments themselves. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the correct statement is:\n\nB. In the relaxed position tropomyosin impedes myosin's access to the binding site of actin.",
