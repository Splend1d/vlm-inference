            "content": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option in the context of boundary issues along the United States\u2013Mexico border:\n\nA. **Ownership of fertile ground**: This refers to disputes over land that is valuable for agriculture. While ownership of fertile land can lead to border disputes, it is not the primary cause of boundary problems along the U.S.\u2013Mexico border.\n\nB. **Land use**: This involves the management and development of land. While land use can influence border disputes, it is not the fundamental cause of the boundary issues.\n\nC. **Irredentism**: This is the policy or practice of a country seeking to recover territories that it believes were once part of its territory. In the context of the U.S.\u2013Mexico border, irredentism is a significant factor. The idea of reclaiming lost territories, such as parts of the southwestern United States that were part of Mexico before the Mexican-American War, has fueled territorial disputes and border conflicts.\n\nD. **Immigration**: While immigration is a significant issue along the U.S.\u2013Mexico border, it is not a cause of boundary problems. Instead, it is a consequence of the border's role as a point of entry and exit.\n\nAfter evaluating each option, the most accurate answer is:\n\nC. Irredentism\n\nThis is because the historical and political context of the U.S.\u2013Mexico border has been shaped by territorial claims and the desire to reclaim lost lands, which is a key factor in the boundary issues.",
