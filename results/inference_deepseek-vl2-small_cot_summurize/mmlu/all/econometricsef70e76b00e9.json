            "content": "The Dickey-Fuller test is a statistical test used to determine whether a time series is stationary or not. The test statistic for the Dickey-Fuller test is calculated as the ratio of the difference between the sample mean and the sample mean of the first lagged difference to the standard deviation of the first lagged difference.\n\nThe Dickey-Fuller test statistic is not normally distributed, and it is not symmetric. Therefore, it is not appropriate to compare the Dickey-Fuller test statistic to the left-hand tail of a normal distribution.\n\nThe Dickey-Fuller test statistic is obtained from an analytical formula for the density of the Dickey-Fuller distribution, which is a non-normal distribution.\n\nThe Dickey-Fuller test statistic is not necessarily more negative for a 10% size of test than a 5% test. The size of the test (i.e., the significance level) does not affect the distribution of the test statistic.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Obtained from an analytical formula for the density of the Dickey-Fuller distribution.",
