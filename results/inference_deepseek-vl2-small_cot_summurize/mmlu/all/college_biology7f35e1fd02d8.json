            "content": "To determine the phenotypic ratio of the progeny from the cross between a tall violet plant (DDWw) and a dwarf white plant (ddww), we need to consider the dominance relationships between the alleles.\n\n1. **Allele Dominance**: \n   - The allele for tall plants (D) is dominant over the allele for dwarf plants (d).\n   - The allele for violet flower color (W) is dominant over the allele for white flower color (w).\n\n2. **Genotype Analysis**:\n   - The tall violet plant has the genotype DDWw.\n   - The dwarf white plant has the genotype ddww.\n\n3. **Crossing the Plants**:\n   - When these two plants are crossed, the possible genotypes of the progeny are:\n     - DDWw (tall violet)\n     - DdDw (tall white)\n     - ddWw (dwarf violet)\n     - ddww (dwarf white)\n\n4. **Phenotypic Ratios**:\n   - **Tall violet (DDWw)**: This plant will produce offspring with the genotypes DDWw, DdDw, and ddWw. All these will express the tall plant phenotype.\n   - **Tall white (DdDw)**: This plant will produce offspring with the genotypes DDWw, DdDw, and ddww. The offspring with the genotype DDWw will express the tall plant phenotype, while the offspring with the genotypes DdDw and ddww will express the tall white phenotype.\n   - **Dwarf violet (ddWw)**: This plant will produce offspring with the genotypes DDWw, DdDw, and ddww. The offspring with the genotype DDWw will express the tall plant phenotype, while the offspring with the genotypes DdDw and ddww will express the dwarf plant phenotype.\n   - **Dwarf white (ddww)**: This plant will produce offspring with the genotypes DDWw, DdDw, and ddww. All these will express the dwarf plant phenotype.\n\n5. **Phenotypic Ratio**:\n   - Tall violet: 1\n   - Tall white: 1\n   - Dwarf violet: 1\n   - Dwarf white: 1\n\nThus, the expected phenotypic ratio of the progeny from this cross is 1 tall violet: 1 tall white: 1 dwarf violet: 1 dwarf white.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **C. 1 tall violet: 1 tall white: 1 dwarf violet: 1 dwarf white**.",
