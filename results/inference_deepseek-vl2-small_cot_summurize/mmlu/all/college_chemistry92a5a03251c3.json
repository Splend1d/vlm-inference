            "content": "To determine the chemical shift of [Ru(NH3)6]2+, we need to consider the paramagnetic effects on the electronic transitions. The chemical shift is influenced by the magnetic field produced by the unpaired electrons in the metal center.\n\n1. **Understanding Chemical Shifts**: The chemical shift is a measure of the resonance frequency of a nucleus in a magnetic field. It is typically expressed in parts per million (ppm).\n\n2. **Paramagnetic Effects**: The paramagnetic current in a metal center is influenced by the electronic configuration and the nature of the ligands. In this case, we are comparing [Ru(H2O)6]2+ and [Ru(NH3)6]2+.\n\n3. **Electronic Excitation Energies**: The electronic excitation energies are given as 18,900 cm-1 for [Ru(H2O)6]2+, 40,000 cm-1 for [Ru(CN)6]2-, and 25,600 cm-1 for [Ru(NH3)6]2+. These values indicate the energy required to excite electrons from the ground state to an excited state.\n\n4. **Paramagnetic Currents**: The paramagnetic current is proportional to the number of unpaired electrons. The higher the excitation energy, the more electrons are excited, and the stronger the paramagnetic current.\n\n5. **Chemical Shift Calculation**: The chemical shift of [Ru(NH3)6]2+ can be calculated by considering the paramagnetic effects. The paramagnetic current in [Ru(NH3)6]2+ is less than in [Ru(H2O)6]2+ because the excitation energy is lower.\n\n6. **Comparison**: Since [Ru(H2O)6]2+ has a higher excitation energy, it has a stronger paramagnetic current, resulting in a larger chemical shift.\n\n7. **Conclusion**: Given the excitation energies, the chemical shift of [Ru(NH3)6]2+ is expected to be lower than that of [Ru(H2O)6]2+.\n\nTherefore, the chemical shift of [Ru(NH3)6]2+ is approximately 8,090 ppm.\n\nThe correct answer is **B. 8,090 ppm**.",
