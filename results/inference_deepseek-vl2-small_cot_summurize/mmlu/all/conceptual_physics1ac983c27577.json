Since the lamps are in parallel, the voltage across each lamp is the same as the voltage across the battery.\n\nThe current in a parallel circuit is inversely proportional to the resistance of the circuit. Since the resistance of a lamp is a constant, the current in each lamp is directly proportional to the voltage across the lamp.\n\nIf the current in one lamp is 2 A, and the voltage across the lamp is the same as the voltage across the battery, then the current in the other lamp will also be 2 A.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 2 A",
