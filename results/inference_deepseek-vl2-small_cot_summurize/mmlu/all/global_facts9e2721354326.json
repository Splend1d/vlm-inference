According to UNESCO, the global literacy rate for individuals aged 15 and above in 2015 was 86.3%.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\nA. 81% - This option is too low. The global literacy rate in 2015 was significantly higher than 81%.\n\nB. 86% - This option is correct. The global literacy rate in 2015 was 86.3%, as reported by UNESCO.\n\nC. 91% - This option is also too high. While the global literacy rate has increased over the years, it did not reach 91% in 2015.\n\nD. 96% - This option is even higher than the correct answer. The global literacy rate in 2015 was not 96%.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 86%.",
