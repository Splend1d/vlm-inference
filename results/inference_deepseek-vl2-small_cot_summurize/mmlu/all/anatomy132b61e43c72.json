It is not involved in filtering blood or storing red blood cells.\n\nB. **Gallbladder**: The gallbladder is a small, pear-shaped organ located under the liver. It stores bile produced by the liver and is not involved in filtering blood or storing red blood cells.\n\nC. **Pancreas**: The pancreas is an organ that produces digestive enzymes and hormones like insulin. It is not involved in filtering blood or storing red blood cells.\n\nD. **Spleen**: The spleen is a lymphoid organ located in the upper left part of the abdomen. It is responsible for filtering blood, removing old or damaged red blood cells, and storing white blood cells. It also plays a role in the immune response.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is D. **Spleen**. The spleen is the lymphoid organ that acts as a reservoir for red blood cells and filters organisms from the blood.",
