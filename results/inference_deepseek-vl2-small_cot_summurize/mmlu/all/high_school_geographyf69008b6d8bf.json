Many TNCs operate in areas of electronics, chemicals, pharmaceuticals and petroleum.\n- This statement is correct. TNCs often operate in diverse sectors such as electronics, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and petroleum, reflecting their global reach and influence.\n\nB. Most TNCs produce and sell manufactured goods.\n- This statement is also correct. TNCs are known for manufacturing and selling a wide range of goods, from consumer electronics to automobiles, and from pharmaceuticals to clothing.\n\nC. Most TNCs are headquartered in the United States, Japan, and the European Union.\n- This statement is correct.
