When the attacker replies to a message sent to it by the system: This describes a response, not an attack. A replay attack involves reusing messages, not responding to them.\n\nB. An attack that continuously repeats, probing for a weakness: This describes a brute force attack, where the attacker tries many different passwords or keys until one works. It doesn't specifically involve reusing messages.\n\nC. An attack that uses the system's own messages and so cannot be defended against: This describes a replay attack. The attacker captures a message, retransmits it, and the system accepts it as valid, allowing the attacker to exploit the system.\n\nD. The attacker resends a captured message, and the site accept its and responds in the attacker's favor: This describes a replay attack, where the attacker captures a message and retransmits it to gain unauthorized access.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. An attack that uses the system's own messages and so cannot be defended against.",
