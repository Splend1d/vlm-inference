            "content": "To determine the correct combination of thermodynamic properties for the reaction, we need to analyze the information given:\n\n1. **Nonspontaneity at 1 atm and 298 K**: This indicates that the Gibbs free energy (\u0394G) is positive at these conditions, meaning the reaction does not occur spontaneously.\n\n2. **Spontaneity at -78\u00b0C with dry ice**: Cooling the system with dry ice (a solid) suggests that the reaction is exothermic (\u0394H < 0) because the system releases heat, making it more thermodynamically favorable.\n\n3. **\u0394G = \u0394H - T\u0394S**: Since \u0394G is positive at 1 atm and 298 K, and the reaction becomes spontaneous at -78\u00b0C, we can deduce:\n   - **\u0394H < 0**: The reaction is exothermic, releasing heat.\n   - **\u0394S < 0**: The entropy change is negative, indicating a decrease in disorder.\n   - **\u0394G > 0**: The reaction is nonspontaneous at 1 atm and 298 K, but becomes spontaneous at -78\u00b0C.\n\nGiven these points, the correct combination of thermodynamic properties is:\n\nC. \u0394H < 0, \u0394S < 0, and \u0394G > 0\n\nThis combination accurately describes the reaction's behavior under the given conditions.",
