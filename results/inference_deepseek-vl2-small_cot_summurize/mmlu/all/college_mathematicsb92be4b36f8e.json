For any two distinct column vectors \\( u \\) and \\( v \\) of \\( M \\), the set \\( \\{u, v\\} \\) is linearly independent.\n\nThis condition is equivalent to the others because if the set \\( \\{u, v\\} \\) is linearly independent, then the matrix \\( M \\) has full rank, and the system of equations \\( Mx = b \\) has a unique solution for each real 5 x 1 column vector \\( b \\).\n\nB. The homogeneous system \\( Mx = 0 \\) has only the trivial solution.\n\nThis condition is equivalent to the others because if the homogeneous system \\( Mx = 0 \\) has only the trivial solution, then the matrix \\( M \\) has full rank, and the system of equations \\( Mx = b \\) has a unique solution for each real 5 x 1 column vector \\( b \\).\n\nC. The system of equations \\( Mx = b \\) has a unique solution for each real 5 x 1 column vector \\( b \\).\n\nThis condition is equivalent to the others because if the system of equations \\( Mx = b \\) has a unique solution for each real 5 x 1 column vector \\( b \\), then the matrix \\( M \\) has full rank, and the set \\( \\{u, v\\} \\) is linearly independent.\n\nD.

If the determinant of \\( M \\) is nonzero, then the matrix \\( M \\) has full rank, and the system of equations \\( Mx = b \\) has a unique solution for each real 5 x 1 column vector \\( b \\). But this does not necessarily mean that the set \\( \\{u, v\\} \\) is linearly independent.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\\[ D \\]",
