            "content": "Let's analyze each statement one by one:\n\nA. Water flows from hypertonic to hypotonic.\n- In a hypertonic solution, the concentration of solutes is higher than in a hypotonic solution. Water moves from an area of lower solute concentration (hypotonic) to an area of higher solute concentration (hypertonic) to balance the solute concentrations on both sides of the cell membrane. This movement is driven by osmosis. Therefore, this statement is correct.\n\nB. Germinating seeds use less oxygen than do nongerminating seeds.\n- Germinating seeds require oxygen for respiration to produce energy for growth. Nongerminating seeds do not require oxygen for respiration. Therefore, germinating seeds use more oxygen than nongerminating seeds. This statement is incorrect.\n\nC. The rate of transpiration decreases with an increase in air movement.\n- Transpiration is the process by which water is transported from the roots to the leaves and then evaporates into the atmosphere. Air movement increases the rate of evaporation, which in turn increases the rate of transpiration. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\nD. Smaller DNA fragments migrate more rapidly than do larger DNA fragments on gel electrophoresis.\n- On a gel electrophoresis, smaller DNA fragments move more rapidly through the gel matrix than larger DNA fragments due to their smaller size and less resistance to movement. This statement is correct.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct statements are A and D.",
