The team that produces more tension in the rope is likely to win because tension is a measure of the force exerted on the rope. The team with more tension can pull the rope more effectively, making it harder for the opposing team to pull it back.\n\nB. **pushes hardest on the ground**\n\n- While pushing hard on the ground can contribute to the overall force applied in a tug-of-war, it does not directly determine the outcome of the contest. The key factor is the tension in the rope, not the force applied on the ground.\n\nC. **Both**\n\n- This option suggests that both producing more tension and pushing hardest on the ground are equally important. While pushing hard on the ground can contribute to the tension, the primary determinant of winning a tug-of-war is the tension in the rope.\n\nD. **Neither**\n\n- This option implies that neither of the factors mentioned in options A and B is relevant. However, producing more tension in the rope is a crucial factor in determining the winner of a tug-of-war.\n\nGiven the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nA. produces more tension in the rope than the opponent",
