            "content": "To determine the voltage across a 10-ohm resistor carrying 10 A of current, we can use Ohm's Law, which is given by:\n\n\\[ V = I \\times R \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( V \\) is the voltage across the resistor,\n- \\( I \\) is the current flowing through the resistor,\n- \\( R \\) is the resistance of the resistor.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( I = 10 \\) A (current),\n- \\( R = 10 \\) \u03a9 (resistance).\n\nSubstitute these values into the formula:\n\n\\[ V = 10 \\, \\text{A} \\times 10 \\, \\Omega \\]\n\n\\[ V = 100 \\, \\text{V} \\]\n\nThus, the voltage across the resistor is 100 volts.\n\nNow, let's analyze the answer choices:\n\nA. 0: This is incorrect because the current is not zero, and the voltage cannot be zero.\n\nB. More than 0 but less than 10 V: This is incorrect because the calculated voltage is 100 V, which is more than 10 V.\n\nC. 10 V: This is incorrect because the calculated voltage is 100 V, not 10 V.\n\nD. More than 10 V: This is correct because the calculated voltage is 100 V, which is indeed more than 10 V.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. More than 10 V",
