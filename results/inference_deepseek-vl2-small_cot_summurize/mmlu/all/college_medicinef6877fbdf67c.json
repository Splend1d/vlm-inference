            "content": "To determine how the body compensates for increased environmental temperature, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Decreasing salt retention: This option is incorrect. The body typically retains salt to maintain fluid balance and blood pressure, especially in hot conditions. Reducing salt retention would not help in cooling the body.\n\nB. Increasing respiration rate: This option is correct. When the body is exposed to higher temperatures, it needs to dissipate heat more efficiently. Increasing the respiratory rate helps to expel more carbon dioxide and heat from the body, which is a primary method of heat loss.\n\nC. Increasing heart rate: While the heart rate can increase to circulate more blood and deliver more oxygen to the muscles, this is not the primary mechanism for heat dissipation. The heart rate increase is more about maintaining blood flow and oxygen delivery rather than directly cooling the body.\n\nD. Increasing water lost through skin: This option is incorrect. While sweating is a method of cooling, it is not the primary mechanism. The body primarily uses evaporation of sweat to cool itself, and it is not the main compensatory response to increased temperature.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Increasing respiration rate. This is the primary mechanism by which the body compensates for increased environmental temperature.",
