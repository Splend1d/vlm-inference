            "content": "To determine which group of organisms is most likely to be surrounded by a protein coat, we need to understand the structural characteristics of each group:\n\nA. **Viruses**: Viruses are unique among the listed groups because they are not considered living organisms. They are composed of genetic material (DNA or RNA) encased in a protein coat called a capsid. The capsid serves as a protective layer and is crucial for the virus's ability to infect host cells.\n\nB. **Bacteria**: Bacteria are single-celled microorganisms that have a cell wall and a plasma membrane. They do not have a protein coat. Instead, they have a rigid cell wall made of peptidoglycan, which provides structural support and protection.\n\nC. **Eukaryotes**: Eukaryotic cells have a defined nucleus and membrane-bound organelles. They do not have a protein coat. Instead, they have a plasma membrane that encloses the cell's contents.\n\nD. **Archaea**: Similar to bacteria, archaea are single-celled microorganisms. They have a cell wall and a plasma membrane, but they do not have a protein coat. Their cell walls are made of peptidoglycan, which provides structural support.\n\nBy analyzing the structural characteristics of each group, we can conclude that viruses are the only group among the options that are surrounded by a protein coat. This protein coat is essential for the virus's ability to infect host cells and replicate.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Viruses",
