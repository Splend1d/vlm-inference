The term \"para\" indicates the position of the chlorine atoms on the benzene ring.\n\nIn para-dichlorobenzene, the two chlorine atoms are located on opposite sides of the benzene ring, which is why it is referred to as \"para.\" This arrangement is also known as the \"ortho\" position in the context of ortho-disubstituted compounds.\n\nGiven the options:\n\nA. 1,2-dichlorobenzene - This would indicate that the chlorine atoms are on adjacent carbon atoms (1,2-position), which is not the case for para-dichlorobenzene.\n\nB. 1,3-dichlorobenzene - This would indicate that the chlorine atoms are on opposite carbon atoms (1,3-position), which is the correct description for para-dichlorobenzene.\n\nC. 2,4-dichlorobenzene - This would indicate that the chlorine atoms are on opposite carbon atoms (2,4-position), which is not the case for para-dichlorobenzene.\n\nD. 1,4-dichlorobenzene - This would indicate that the chlorine atoms are on opposite carbon atoms (1,4-position), which is not the case for para-dichlorobenzene.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 1,3-dichlorobenzene.",
