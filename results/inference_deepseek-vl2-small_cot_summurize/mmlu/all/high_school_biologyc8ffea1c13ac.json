All cells are surrounded by a plasma membrane.\n- This is true, but it is a more specific characteristic rather than a universal one. While all cells do have a plasma membrane, it is not the most fundamental aspect that unifies all life.\n\nB. All cells have at least one nucleus.\n- This is a universal characteristic of eukaryotic cells. Eukaryotic cells, which include plants, animals, fungi, and protists, all have a nucleus that contains their genetic material. This is a key feature that distinguishes them from prokaryotic cells, which lack a nucleus.\n\nC. All cells carry out cellular respiration in mitochondria.\n- This is true for eukaryotic cells, but not all cells carry out cellular respiration in mitochondria. Prokaryotic cells, such as bacteria, carry out cellular respiration in their cytoplasm, not in mitochondria.\n\nD. The surface-to-volume ratio of all cells is the same.\n- This is not true. The surface-to-volume ratio varies greatly among different types of cells. For example, muscle cells have a high surface-to-volume ratio to facilitate efficient energy transfer, while red blood cells have a low surface-to-volume ratio to maximize oxygen transport.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the aspect that best reveals the unity of all life is:\n\nB. All cells have at least one nucleus.\n\nThis characteristic is a fundamental feature that unifies all eukaryotic cells, making it the most appropriate answer.",
