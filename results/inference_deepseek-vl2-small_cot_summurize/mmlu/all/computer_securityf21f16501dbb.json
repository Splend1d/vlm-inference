It is used for temporary storage of data, particularly in function calls and recursive functions. It does not fit the description of a sequential segment of memory allocated for data.\n\nB. **Queue**: A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. It is used for managing tasks or processes that need to be executed in a specific order. Like the stack, it is not used for storing data in a sequential memory segment.\n\nC. **External Storage**: This refers to storage devices external to the computer, such as hard drives, USB drives, or network storage. It is not a part of the computer's memory and does not fit the description of a sequential memory segment.\n\nD. **Buffer**: A buffer is a region of memory used to temporarily hold data while it is being moved from one place to another. Buffers are commonly used in data processing to manage the flow of data between different parts of a program or between different programs. They are sequential segments of memory allocated for data, making this the correct answer.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. **Buffer**.",
