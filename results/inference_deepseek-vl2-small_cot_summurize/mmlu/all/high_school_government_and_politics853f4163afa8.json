            "content": "To determine the primary reason why committees in the House of Representatives are more influential than those in the Senate, we need to consider the structure and function of each chamber.\n\n- **Option A** suggests that the difference in size between the two chambers means more work is done in the Senate and more in the House. This is incorrect because the Senate is smaller, and both chambers have similar responsibilities in terms of legislative work.\n\n- **Option B** states that the Senate has confirmation powers that the House does not have. This is incorrect because the House does have the power to impeach, and the Senate is responsible for trying impeachments.\n\n- **Option C** suggests that members are appointed to the House committees but elected to the Senate committees. This is incorrect because members are elected to both chambers and serve on committees in both.\n\n- **Option D** states that any member of any party can serve on a committee in the House, but only major party members can serve on committees in the Senate. This is correct. In the House, members from any party can serve on committees, allowing for a broader range of perspectives and ideas. In contrast, the Senate has rules that require members to be from the major parties, limiting the diversity of committee membership.\n\nTherefore, the primary reason that committees in the House of Representatives are more influential than those in the Senate is that any member of any party can serve on a committee in the House, but only major party members can serve on committees in the Senate. This allows for a more diverse range of ideas and perspectives to be considered in the House, making its committees more influential.\n\nThe correct answer is **D**.",
