Mutation-based fuzzing does not generate new inputs by modifying existing ones. Instead, it introduces new inputs by making small changes to the existing inputs.\n\nB. **It works by making small mutations to the target program to induce faults**: This statement is correct. Mutation-based fuzzing involves making small, random changes to the input data to create new inputs. These mutations are designed to cause the program to behave unexpectedly, which can reveal bugs or vulnerabilities.\n\nC. **Each input is mutation that follows a given grammar**: This statement is incorrect. Mutation-based fuzzing does not follow a specific grammar. Instead, it uses random mutation techniques to generate new inputs.\n\nD. **It only makes sense for file-based fuzzing, not network-based fuzzing**: This statement is incorrect. Mutation-based fuzzing can be applied to both file-based and network-based fuzzing. The technique is versatile and can be used to test various types of software, including those that interact with networks.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the correct answer is:\n\nB. It works by making small mutations to the target program to induce faults.",
