This indicates that the bladder is not fully emptied, and the catheter is obstructed.\n\n2. **Purpose of the Washout**: The primary goal of the bladder washout is to ensure that the bladder is completely emptied of any residual urine, which can help prevent infection and other complications.\n\n3. **Options Analysis**:\n   - **Solution R**: This is a specific solution used in certain medical procedures, but without additional context, it's not clear if it's appropriate for this situation.\n   - **Normal Saline**: This is a common solution used in medical settings for various purposes, including flushing catheters. It is sterile and non-toxic, making it a safe choice for bladder washout.\n   - **Solution G**: Similar to Solution R, without specific context, it's unclear if it's suitable for this situation.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Given the need to ensure the bladder is completely emptied and the safety of the patient, the most appropriate solution for completing the bladder washout is **Normal Saline**.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. Normal saline**.",
