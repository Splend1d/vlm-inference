The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provides comprehensive data on obesity rates in the United States.\n\nAccording to the CDC, in 2016, approximately 39.6% of adults in the United States were obese. This figure is based on data collected through the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. 6% - This is too low, as it does not reflect the actual obesity rate.\nB. 13% - This is also too low, as it does not match the data from the CDC.\nC. 27% - This is closer but still not accurate.\nD. 46% - This is the closest to the actual obesity rate of 39.6% in 2016.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 46%.",
