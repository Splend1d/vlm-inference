Species diversity declines farther from the equator.\n- This observation is related to the distribution of species and can be explained by factors such as climate and geography. It does not directly support the concept of descent with modification, which focuses on the evolutionary relationships between species.\n\nB. Fewer species live on islands than on the nearest continents.\n- This observation is consistent with the idea of evolution through natural selection, as it suggests that species on islands may have evolved from a common ancestor with species on the nearest continents. This supports the concept of descent with modification, as it implies that species on islands have diverged from those on the continents.\n\nC. Birds can be found on islands located farther from the mainland than the birds' maximum nonstop flight distance.\n- This observation is more about the limits of bird migration rather than the evolutionary relationships between species. It does not directly support the concept of descent with modification.\n\nD. South American temperate plants are more similar to the tropical plants of South America than to the temperate plants of Europe.\n- This observation is about the geographical distribution of plant species and does not directly relate to the concept of descent with modification. It does not provide evidence for evolutionary relationships between species.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the observation that best supports the concept of descent with modification is:\n\nB. Fewer species live on islands than on the nearest continents.",
