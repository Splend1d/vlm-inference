This suggests that the song of his species is innate and does not require learning from his peers or environment.\n\nThe fact that the young bird develops a song repertoire that is different from the songs of his own species, but still retains some characteristics of his own species, indicates that the song is instinctual. The bird's brain is wired to produce a song that is similar to the songs of his own species, but the specific characteristics of his own species' songs are not learned through experience.\n\nThis is consistent with the idea that many aspects of animal behavior, including song, are innate and do not require learning. The brain of the bird is hardwired to produce a song that is similar to the songs of his own species, and this is what the bird will produce, even if it is raised in isolation and only exposed to the songs of a different species.\n\nTherefore, the song of his species is most likely entirely instinctive.",
