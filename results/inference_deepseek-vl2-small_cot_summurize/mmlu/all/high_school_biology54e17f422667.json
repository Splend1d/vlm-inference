            "content": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Codominance: In codominance, both alleles are fully expressed in the phenotype. For example, in the ABO blood group system, individuals with type A blood have both A and B antigens on their red blood cells, while those with type B blood have both B and A antigens. This is exactly what the question describes: the child inherits an IA allele and an IB allele, resulting in both A and B glycoproteins being expressed.\n\nB. Epistasis: Epistasis refers to the interaction between two or more genes where the effect of one gene is modified by one or more other genes. This does not apply to the inheritance of blood group antigens, as it involves multiple genes and interactions, not a single gene with two alleles.\n\nC. Polygenic: Polygenic traits are influenced by multiple genes, often resulting in a continuous range of phenotypes. The ABO blood group system is not polygenic; it is determined by a single gene with two alleles.\n\nD. Linkage: Linkage refers to the tendency of genes located close together on the same chromosome to be inherited together. While linkage can affect the inheritance of certain traits, it does not describe the pattern of expression of the A and B antigens on red blood cells.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is A. codominance. The child's phenotype of carrying both A and B glycoproteins on the surface of red blood cells is a classic example of codominance.",
