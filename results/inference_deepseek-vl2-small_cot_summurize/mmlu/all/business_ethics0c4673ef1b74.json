Share options, Senior managers, Share Price\n- Share options are typically offered to senior managers to align their interests with the company's performance. However, they are not available to all employees, and the focus is on the share price, which is a financial metric.\n\nB. Share options, All employees, Share Price\n- Share options are not usually available to all employees, as they are typically reserved for senior management. Additionally, the focus is on the share price, which is not a measure of employee satisfaction.\n\nC. Non-financial remunerations, Senior managers, Employee Satisfaction\n- Non-financial remunerations are incentives that do not involve direct financial compensation. While they can be offered to senior managers, the focus on employee satisfaction is not directly related to aligning interests with shareholders.\n\nD. Non-financial remunerations, All employees, Employee Satisfaction\n- Non-financial remunerations can be offered to all employees to align their interests with the company's performance. These incentives can include benefits like health insurance, retirement plans, and flexible work hours, which contribute to employee satisfaction. This approach aligns the interests of all employees with the company's performance, as higher employee satisfaction can lead to increased productivity and better financial performance, which benefits shareholders.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Non-financial remunerations, All employees, Employee Satisfaction.",
