            "content": "To determine which of the given sets must also be ideals of the ring \\( R \\), we need to check each set against the definition of an ideal. An ideal \\( I \\) of a ring \\( R \\) is a subset of \\( R \\) that is closed under addition and under multiplication by any element of \\( R \\).\n\nLet's analyze each set:\n\n**Set I: \\(\\{u + v : u \\in U \\text{ and } v \\in V\\}\\)**\n\n- **Closure under addition:** If \\( u_1, u_2 \\in U \\) and \\( v_1, v_2 \\in V \\), then \\( u_1 + u_2 \\in U \\) and \\( v_1 + v_2 \\in V \\). Therefore, \\( u_1 + u_2 + v_1 + v_2 \\in U + V \\).\n- **Closure under multiplication by any element of \\( R \\):** If \\( u \\in U \\) and \\( v \\in V \\), then \\( uv \\in U \\) and \\( uv \\in V \\). Therefore, \\( uv \\cdot r \\in U \\) and \\( uv \\cdot r \\in V \\) for any \\( r \\in R \\).\n\nThus, \\(\\{u + v : u \\in U \\text{ and } v \\in V\\}\\) is an ideal of \\( R \\).\n\n**Set II: \\(\\{uv : u \\in U \\text{ and } v \\in V\\}\\)**\n\n- **Closure under addition:** This set is not closed under addition because \\( uv + wv \\neq uv + w(uv) \\) in general. For example, if \\( u = 1 \\), \\( v = 1 \\), and \\( w = 1 \\), then \\( uv = 1 \\) and \\( wv = 1 \\), but \\( uv + wv = 1 + 1 = 2 \\neq 1 \\).\n- **Closure under multiplication by any element of \\( R \\):** This set is not closed under multiplication by any element of \\( R \\) because \\( uv \\cdot r \\neq uv \\cdot r \\) in general. For example, if \\( u = 1 \\), \\( v = 1 \\), and \\( r = 1 \\), then \\( uv = 1 \\) and \\( uv \\cdot r = 1 \\cdot 1 = 1 \\), but \\( uv \\cdot r \\neq uv \\cdot r \\) in general.\n\nThus, \\(\\{uv : u \\in U \\text{ and } v \\in V\\}\\) is not an ideal of \\( R \\).\n\n**Set III: \\(\\{x : x \\in U \\text{ and } x \\in V\\}\\)**\n\n- **Closure under addition:** This set is not closed under addition because \\( x + x \\neq x \\) in general. For example, if \\( x = 1 \\), then \\( x + x = 1 + 1 = 2 \\neq 1 \\).\n- **Closure under multiplication by any element of \\( R \\):** This set is not closed under multiplication by any element of \\( R \\) because \\( x \\cdot r \\neq x \\cdot r \\) in general. For example, if \\( x = 1 \\), then \\( x \\cdot r = 1 \\cdot r = r \\neq 1 \\).\n\nThus, \\(\\{x : x \\in U \\text{ and } x \\in V\\}\\) is not an ideal of \\( R \\).\n\nBased on the analysis, the only set that must also be an ideal of \\( R \\) is \\(\\{u + v : u \\in U \\text{ and } v \\in V\\}\\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{A}\n\\]",
