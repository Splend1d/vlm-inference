            "content": "To determine which zone of Burgess's concentric zone model would feature better houses, single-family homes, and higher-rent apartments, we need to understand the characteristics of each zone:\n\n1. **First Zone**: This is the central area of the city, often referred to as the \"Central Business District\" (CBD). It is characterized by high land values, high-density housing, and commercial activities. The housing here is typically more expensive, and the area is bustling with business and economic activity.\n\n2. **Second Zone**: This zone is located just outside the CBD and is known for its middle-class housing. It features a mix of single-family homes and multi-family dwellings. The housing is generally more affordable than in the first zone, but still offers a good quality of life.\n\n3. **Third Zone**: This zone is characterized by lower-income housing, including tenements and other forms of affordable housing. The housing quality is generally lower, and the area is more densely populated.\n\n4. **Fourth Zone**: This is the outermost zone of the city, often referred to as the \"suburban fringe.\" It is characterized by single-family homes and lower-density housing. The housing here is typically more affordable, and the area is less densely populated.\n\nGiven this analysis, the **second zone** is where one would find better houses, single-family homes, and higher-rent apartments. This is because it offers a balance between affordability and quality of life, making it an attractive area for middle-class families.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. Second**.",
