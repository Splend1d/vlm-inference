            "content": "To determine which option describes a lossless transformation of a digital image, we need to understand what a lossless transformation means. A lossless transformation is one where the original image can be perfectly reconstructed from the transformed image without any loss of information.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Compressing the image in a way that may lose information but will suffer only a small loss of image quality. This is a lossy transformation because it involves discarding some information to reduce the file size, which means the original image cannot be perfectly reconstructed.\n\nB. Creating the gray scale of an image by averaging the amounts of red, green, and blue in each pixel and assigning this new value to the corresponding pixel in the new image. This is a lossy transformation because it reduces the color information to a single value per pixel, losing the original color information.\n\nC. Creating the negative of an image by creating a new RGB triplet for each pixel in which each value is calculated by subtracting the original value from 255. This is a lossless transformation because the negative of an image is simply the reversal of the original image. Each pixel's value is calculated by subtracting the original RGB value from 255, which means the original image can be perfectly reconstructed by adding the original RGB values back to the new RGB values.\n\nD. Modifying part of the image by taking the pixels in one part of the picture and copying them to the pixels in another part of the picture. This is a lossy transformation because it involves duplicating some information, which means the original image cannot be perfectly reconstructed.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Creating the negative of an image by creating a new RGB triplet for each pixel in which each value is calculated by subtracting the original value from 255. This transformation is lossless because it perfectly reconstructs the original image.",
