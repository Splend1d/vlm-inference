            "content": "The correct answer is C. Once a plasmid has incorporated specific genes, such as the gene coding for the antibiotic ampicillin, into its genome, the plasmid may be cloned by inserting it into a suitable bacterium in order to produce multiple copies. This process is known as bacterial transformation. The bacterium takes up the plasmid, which then replicates within the cell, producing multiple copies of the plasmid. This method is commonly used in molecular biology to amplify specific genes.",
