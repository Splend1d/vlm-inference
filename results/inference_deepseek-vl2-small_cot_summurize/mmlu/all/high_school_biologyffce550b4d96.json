            "content": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Sexual Selection**: This involves traits that enhance an individual's ability to attract mates. It is not directly related to the distribution of care and resources between sexes.\n\nB. **Disruptive Selection**: This occurs when two extreme phenotypes are favored over intermediate phenotypes. It does not specifically address the imbalance in sex ratio and resource allocation.\n\nC. **Balancing Selection**: This type of selection occurs when two extreme phenotypes are equally favored, leading to a reduction in the frequency of the extreme phenotypes. This is not applicable here, as the question describes a situation where one sex receives more care and resources.\n\nD. **Frequency-Dependent Selection**: This occurs when the fitness of an individual depends on the frequency of its alleles in the population. In this context, it refers to the differential allocation of resources based on the sex ratio. When the sex ratio is skewed, the minority sex receives more care and resources, which can increase its fitness relative to the majority sex. This is a classic example of frequency-dependent selection.\n\nGiven the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Frequency-Dependent Selection.",
