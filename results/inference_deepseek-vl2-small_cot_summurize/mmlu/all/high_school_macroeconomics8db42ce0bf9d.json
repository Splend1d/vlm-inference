This is because the real interest rate reflects the true cost of borrowing or the true yield on lending after accounting for the effects of inflation.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **What one sees when looking at bank literature**: This option is not a definition of the real interest rate. It's a statement about where one might find information about interest rates, but it doesn't describe the real interest rate itself.\n\nB. **The nominal interest rate divided by the inflation rate**: This option is incorrect. Dividing the nominal interest rate by the inflation rate would give you the real interest rate, but it's not the definition of the real interest rate.\n\nC. **The nominal interest rate plus the anticipated inflation rate**: This option is incorrect. Adding the nominal interest rate and the anticipated inflation rate would give you the nominal interest rate, not the real interest rate.\n\nD. **The nominal interest rate minus anticipated inflation**: This option is correct. The real interest rate is calculated by subtracting the anticipated inflation rate from the nominal interest rate. This reflects the true cost of borrowing or the true yield on lending after accounting for inflation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. The real interest rate is the nominal interest rate minus the anticipated inflation.",
