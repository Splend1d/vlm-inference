            "content": "To determine the correct statement about lipids, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Unsaturated fatty acids are linked to heart disease.\n- Unsaturated fatty acids contain one or more double bonds in their carbon chain. These double bonds can cause the fatty acids to be more flexible and less prone to forming tight packing structures, which can lead to plaque buildup in arteries. This is a significant factor in the development of heart disease. Therefore, this statement is correct.\n\nB. Lipids make up most cell surface receptors.\n- Lipids, such as phospholipids, are components of cell membranes but do not make up most cell surface receptors. Cell surface receptors are typically proteins, not lipids. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\nC. Phospholipids are water soluble.\n- Phospholipids are amphipathic molecules, meaning they have both hydrophilic (water-loving) and hydrophobic (water-repelling) parts. The hydrophobic tails are non-polar, while the hydrophilic heads are polar. This amphipathic nature allows phospholipids to form bilayers in aqueous environments, making them water-soluble. Therefore, this statement is correct.\n\nD. Steroids are lipids that consist of glycerol and fatty acids.\n- Steroids are a class of lipids that are structurally different from triglycerides. They consist of a four-ring structure and are not made up of glycerol and fatty acids. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the correct statements are A and C.",
