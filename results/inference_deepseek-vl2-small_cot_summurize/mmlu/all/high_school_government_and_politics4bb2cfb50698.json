            "content": "The Founders met in 1787 to write the Constitution with the primary objective of creating a stronger central government. The Articles of Confederation, which had been in effect since 1781, were found to be too weak to effectively govern the newly independent states. The weaknesses of the Articles included a lack of a strong central government, a single executive, a federal court system, and the inability to levy taxes or regulate commerce.\n\nThe Founders recognized the need for a more robust central government to ensure the stability and security of the new nation. They aimed to create a government that could effectively manage the country's affairs, including foreign policy, defense, and economic regulation. The Constitution they drafted established a federal system of government with three branches: the legislative, executive, and judicial. It also included a system of checks and balances to prevent any one branch from becoming too powerful.\n\nWhile the Constitution did establish a bill of rights to protect individual liberties, this was not the primary objective of the Founders. The Bill of Rights was added to the Constitution in 1791 as a way to address concerns about the potential for tyranny and to reassure citizens that their rights would be protected.\n\nThe other options are not correct because:\n\nB. A national court system was not the primary objective. While the Constitution did establish a federal court system, it was not the main focus of the Founders' efforts.\n\nC. The Founders did not aim to return powers to the states. Instead, they sought to create a stronger central government that could effectively govern the nation.\n\nD. The Founders did not aim to replace the weak central government created by the Articles of Confederation with a stronger one. They sought to create a new government that would be stronger and more effective than the Articles of Confederation.",
