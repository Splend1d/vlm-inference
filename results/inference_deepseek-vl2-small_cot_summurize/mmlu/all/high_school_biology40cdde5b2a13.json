Compared with the larger stock population of mainland finches, these separate populations exhibit far greater variation over a wider range of species. The variation among these numerous finch species is the result of\n\nA. convergent evolution\nB. divergent evolution\nC. disruptive selection\nD. stabilizing selection\n",

            "content": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Convergent evolution: This occurs when unrelated species develop similar traits independently, often due to similar environmental pressures. In the context of finches, this does not explain the variation among species.\n\nB. Divergent evolution: This is the process by which populations of a species evolve into different species over time. The finches on the Galapagos Islands have been isolated for a long time, allowing them to adapt to different environments and ecological niches. This isolation has led to the development of distinct species with unique characteristics, resulting in greater variation.\n\nC. Disruptive selection: This occurs when a population is divided into two or more groups, and the groups adapt to different environments, leading to increased variation. While disruptive selection can contribute to variation, it does not explain the development of new species.\n\nD. Stabilizing selection: This occurs when a population is divided into two or more groups, and the groups adapt to different environments, leading to increased variation. However, stabilizing selection typically reduces variation by favoring the average phenotype, which is not the case here.\n\nConsidering the information provided, the correct answer is B. Divergent evolution. The finches on the Galapagos Islands have been isolated for a long time, allowing them to adapt to different environments and ecological niches, leading to the development of distinct species with unique characteristics and greater variation.",
