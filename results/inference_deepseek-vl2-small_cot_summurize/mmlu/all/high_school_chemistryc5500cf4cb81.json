            "content": "To determine the correct answer, we need to analyze each step of the solution formation process in terms of energy changes.\n\n1. **Step 1: Solvent molecules are separated to make space for the solute.**\n   - This step involves breaking the intermolecular forces between solvent molecules. This process requires energy input because the molecules need to be overcome from their initial state to separate them. Therefore, this step is endothermic.\n\n2. **Step 2: Solute molecules are separated so they fit into spaces in the solvent.**\n   - Similar to step 1, this step involves breaking the intermolecular forces between solute molecules. This also requires energy input, making it endothermic.\n\n3. **Step 3: Separated solute and solvent are brought together, filling in the spaces.**\n   - In this step, the solute and solvent molecules are brought together, and the intermolecular forces between them are formed. This process releases energy because the system is moving towards a more stable, lower-energy state. Therefore, this step is exothermic.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct statement is:\n\nB. Steps 1 and 2 are endothermic, and step 3 is exothermic.",
