            "content": "Let's analyze each option to determine which statement is true about the knee joint.\n\nA. The knee is a ball and socket joint.\n- The knee joint is actually a hinge joint, not a ball and socket joint. In a hinge joint, the bones move in one plane, similar to a door hinge. The knee allows for flexion and extension, which is characteristic of hinge joints. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nB. A baker's cyst can sometimes be found anterior to the knee.\n- A baker's cyst, also known as a popliteal cyst, is a fluid-filled sac that can form behind the knee. It is typically located posterior to the knee, not anterior. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nC. The patellar tap is used to demonstrate an effusion.\n- The patellar tap is a diagnostic procedure used to detect fluid accumulation in the knee joint. By tapping the patella, a healthcare provider can determine if there is a fluid collection, which is indicative of an effusion. This statement is true.\n\nD. 'Knock knee' deformity is due to bilateral genu varum.\n- 'Knock knee' deformity is characterized by the knees bending inward, which is due to a condition called genu varum. However, the term 'knock knee' is often used to describe a condition where the knees are bowed outward, which is known as genu valgum. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the correct answer is C. The patellar tap is used to demonstrate an effusion.",
