            "content": "To determine whether an autoregressive (AR) process is stationary, we need to analyze the roots of its characteristic equation. The characteristic equation for an AR process of order \\( p \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\Phi(z) = 1 - \\sum_{i=1}^{p} \\phi_i z^{-i}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\phi_i\\) are the coefficients of the AR process.\n\nFor the process to be stationary, the roots of the characteristic equation must all lie on the unit circle in the complex plane. This is because if all the roots lie on the unit circle, the system will be stable and the process will be stationary.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. The roots of the characteristic equation must all lie inside the unit circle.\n- If the roots lie inside the unit circle, the system is unstable and the process will not be stationary.\n\nB. The roots of the characteristic equation must all lie on the unit circle.\n- If the roots lie on the unit circle, the system is stable and the process will be stationary.\n\nC. The roots of the characteristic equation must all lie outside the unit circle.\n- If the roots lie outside the unit circle, the system is unstable and the process will not be stationary.\n\nD. The roots of the characteristic equation must all be less than one in absolute value.\n- This condition is not sufficient to determine stationarity. While it is a necessary condition for stability, it does not guarantee that the process is stationary.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. The roots of the characteristic equation must all lie on the unit circle.",
