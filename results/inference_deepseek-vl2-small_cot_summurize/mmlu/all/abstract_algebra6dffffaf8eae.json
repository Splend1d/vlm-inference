            "content": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the properties of the set of all \\( n \\)-th roots of unity under multiplication of complex numbers.\n\n1. **Identity Element**: The identity element in a semigroup is an element that, when multiplied by any other element, leaves the other element unchanged. In the set of \\( n \\)-th roots of unity, the identity element is 1, because multiplying any \\( n \\)-th root of unity by 1 results in the same \\( n \\)-th root of unity.\n\n2. **Closure**: The set of \\( n \\)-th roots of unity is closed under multiplication. This means that if you multiply any two \\( n \\)-th roots of unity, the result is also an \\( n \\)-th root of unity.\n\n3. **Associativity**: Multiplication of \\( n \\)-th roots of unity is associative. This means that the order in which you multiply the roots does not affect the result.\n\n4. **Commutativity**: Multiplication of \\( n \\)-th roots of unity is commutative. This means that the order in which you multiply the roots does not affect the result.\n\n5. **Identity Element**: As mentioned earlier, the identity element is 1.\n\nGiven these properties, the set of all \\( n \\)-th roots of unity under multiplication of complex numbers forms a **semigroup with identity**.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. semi group with identity",
