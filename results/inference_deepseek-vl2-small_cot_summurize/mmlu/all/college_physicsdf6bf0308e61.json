            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to use the principle of conservation of energy. The work done on a particle to accelerate it to a certain speed is equal to the change in its kinetic energy.\n\n1. **Initial Energy**: The particle starts at rest, so its initial kinetic energy is zero.\n\n2. **Final Energy**: The particle is accelerated to a speed of 0.6c. The kinetic energy of a particle is given by the equation:\n   \\[\n   KE = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2\n   \\]\n   where \\( v \\) is the velocity of the particle.\n\n3. **Change in Kinetic Energy**: The change in kinetic energy (\\( \\Delta KE \\)) is the difference between the final kinetic energy and the initial kinetic energy:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta KE = KE_{\\text{final}} - KE_{\\text{initial}} = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 - 0 = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2\n   \\]\n\n4. **Work Done**: The work done on the particle is equal to the change in kinetic energy:\n   \\[\n   W = \\Delta KE = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2\n   \\]\n\n5. **Substitute the Speed**: We know that the speed of the particle is 0.6c. Substituting this into the equation:\n   \\[\n   W = \\frac{1}{2}m(0.6c)^2\n   \\]\n\n6. **Calculate the Work**:\n   \\[\n   W = \\frac{1}{2}m(0.6c)^2 = \\frac{1}{2}m(0.36c^2) = 0.18mc^2\n   \\]\n\n7. **Check the Options**: The closest option to 0.18mc^2 is 0.25mc^2.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 0.25mc^2",
