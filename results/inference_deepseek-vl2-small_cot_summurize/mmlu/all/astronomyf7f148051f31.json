This is correct because liquid water is essential for life. The presence of liquid water on a planet's surface is a critical factor in determining whether a planet can support life.\n\n- **Option B** states that the habitable zone is where humans can survive. While humans are a part of life, the definition of the habitable zone is broader and not limited to human survival.\n\n- **Option C** mentions that the habitable zone is where ultraviolet radiation does not destroy organisms. While this is an important consideration for protecting life, it is not the primary factor defining the habitable zone.\n\n- **Option D** suggests that the habitable zone is where life exists. While life can exist in the habitable zone, the definition of the habitable zone is more about the conditions that allow for the existence of liquid water, not necessarily the presence of life itself.\n\nConsidering these explanations, the correct answer is **A. the region around a star where liquid water can potentially exist on planetary surfaces**. This is because the presence of liquid water is a fundamental requirement for life as we know it.",
