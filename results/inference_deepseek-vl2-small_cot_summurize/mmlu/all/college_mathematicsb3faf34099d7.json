The condition \\((ab)^2 = a^2b^2\\) does not provide any information about the size of the group, so it is not necessarily finite.\n\nB. **Cyclic:** A group is cyclic if there exists an element \\(g \\in G\\) such that every element of \\(G\\) can be written as \\(g^n\\) for some integer \\(n\\). The condition \\((ab)^2 = a^2b^2\\) does not imply the existence of such an element, so it is not necessarily cyclic.\n\nC. **Of order two:** An element \\(a \\in G\\) is of order two if \\(a^2 = e\\) (where \\(e\\) is the identity element). The condition \\((ab)^2 = a^2b^2\\) does not provide any information about the order of any element, so it is not necessarily of order two.\n\nD. **Abelian:** A group is abelian if for all \\(a, b \\in G\\), \\((ab)^2 = a^2b^2\\). The condition \\((ab)^2 = a^2b^2\\) is exactly the definition of an abelian group.\n\nTherefore, the group \\(G\\) in which \\((ab)^2 = a^2b^2\\) for all \\(a, b \\in G\\) is necessarily abelian.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{D}\n\\]",
