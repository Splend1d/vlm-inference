This ratio is typically around 1:1.5 to 1:2, meaning the face is about 1.5 to 2 times the height of the mirror.\n\nGiven this ratio, the minimum height of the patch to wipe away to see your full-face image in a steamy mirror would be approximately half the height of the mirror. This is because the patch needs to cover the area where the face is, which is about half the height of the mirror.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. one-half.",
