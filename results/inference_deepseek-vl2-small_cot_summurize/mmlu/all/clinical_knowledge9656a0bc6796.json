            "content": "Let's analyze each option to determine which statement is true about jaundice:\n\nA. Pale stools and dark urine are characteristic of the jaundice of haemolytic anaemia.\n- This statement is incorrect. Pale stools and dark urine are characteristic of jaundice due to elevated bilirubin levels, not haemolytic anaemia. In haemolytic anaemia, the breakdown of red blood cells is rapid, leading to increased bilirubin production, which results in jaundice.\n\nB. Bilirubin is used by the liver in the synthesis of red blood cells.\n- This statement is incorrect. Bilirubin is a byproduct of the breakdown of red blood cells in the liver. It is not used in the synthesis of red blood cells. Instead, it is processed and excreted from the body.\n\nC. Itching may be a sign of obstructive jaundice.\n- This statement is correct. Obstructive jaundice occurs when there is a blockage in the bile ducts, preventing the normal flow of bile and bilirubin into the intestine. This can lead to the accumulation of bilirubin in the blood, causing jaundice and potentially leading to itching, known as pruritus.\n\nD. Putting a danger of infection sticker on blood samples from an intravenous drug user with jaundice is optional.\n- This statement is incorrect. It is not optional to put a danger of infection sticker on blood samples from an intravenous drug user with jaundice. Such stickers are used to alert laboratory personnel to the potential risk of blood-borne infections, such as HIV or hepatitis, which can be transmitted through contaminated needles.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Itching may be a sign of obstructive jaundice.",
