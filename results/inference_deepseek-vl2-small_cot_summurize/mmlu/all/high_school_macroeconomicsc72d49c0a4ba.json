            "content": "To solve the problem, we need to determine the reserve ratio given that $1000 is deposited into a checking account and the excess reserves increase by $700.\n\nLet's denote the reserve ratio by \\( r \\). The reserve ratio is the fraction of deposits that banks are required to hold as reserves. Therefore, the amount of reserves held by the bank is \\( 1000r \\).\n\nThe excess reserves are the difference between the total deposits and the required reserves. Given that the excess reserves increase by $700, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Excess Reserves} = \\text{Total Deposits} - \\text{Required Reserves}\n\\]\n\nGiven that the excess reserves increase by $700, we have:\n\n\\[\n700 = 1000 - 1000r\n\\]\n\nTo find the reserve ratio \\( r \\), we solve the equation:\n\n\\[\n700 = 1000 - 1000r\n\\]\n\nSubtract 1000 from both sides:\n\n\\[\n700 - 1000 = -1000r\n\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[\n-300 = -1000r\n\\]\n\nDivide both sides by -1000:\n\n\\[\nr = \\frac{300}{1000} = 0.3\n\\]\n\nConvert the decimal to a percentage:\n\n\\[\nr = 0.3 \\times 100\\% = 30\\%\n\\]\n\nThus, the reserve ratio is 30%. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{B}\n\\]",
