            "content": "To determine why terrestrial planet cores contain mostly metal, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. The entire planets are made mostly of metal.\n- This statement is incorrect. While terrestrial planets do have metal-rich cores, the entire planet is not made mostly of metal. The outer layers of terrestrial planets are primarily composed of silicate rocks and metals, but not exclusively.\n\nB. Metals condensed first in the solar nebula and the rocks then accreted around them.\n- This is a plausible explanation. During the formation of the solar system, the solar nebula was a rotating disk of gas and dust. As the nebula cooled, metals, which have a lower boiling point, condensed first. These metals then formed a core. Over time, the remaining material, including silicate rocks, accreted around the metal core, forming the terrestrial planets.\n\nC. Metals sank to the center during a time when the interiors were molten throughout.\n- This is incorrect. While metals do sink to the center of terrestrial planets, the interiors were not molten throughout the entire formation process. The interiors were molten only during the early stages of planetary formation, but as the planets cooled, the interiors solidified.\n\nD. Radioactivity created metals in the core from the decay of uranium.\n- This is incorrect. Radioactive decay does not create metals. Instead, it involves the breakdown of radioactive isotopes, which can release energy but does not contribute to the formation of metals.\n\nAfter evaluating each option, the most accurate explanation is:\n\nB. Metals condensed first in the solar nebula and the rocks then accreted around them.",
