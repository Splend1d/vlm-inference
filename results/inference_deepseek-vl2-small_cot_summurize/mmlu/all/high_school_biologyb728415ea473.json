            "content": "To determine which type of selection best describes the African butterfly species with two distinct color patterns, we need to understand the characteristics of each selection type:\n\nA. **Artificial Selection**: This involves humans selecting for specific traits in organisms, often leading to changes in a population over generations. It does not naturally occur in nature and is not applicable to the butterfly species described.\n\nB. **Directional Selection**: This occurs when one extreme phenotype is favored over others, leading to a shift in the population's phenotype distribution. It does not account for the presence of two distinct phenotypes.\n\nC. **Stabilizing Selection**: This type of selection favors the average phenotype and reduces the frequency of extreme phenotypes. It does not explain the existence of two distinct color patterns.\n\nD. **Disruptive Selection**: This occurs when two extreme phenotypes are favored over the intermediate phenotype, leading to a bimodal distribution of phenotypes. This is the type of selection that would result in the existence of two distinct color patterns in the butterfly species.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is D. Disruptive Selection. This type of selection is responsible for the emergence of two distinct phenotypes in the population, as seen in the African butterfly species.",
