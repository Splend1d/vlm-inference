            "content": "The correct answer is B. the strong cohesion of property of water.\n\nExplanation:\n\nTo understand why the strong cohesion property of water is responsible for holding together the water molecules in a vertical column of water in xylem vessels of a plant, we need to consider the structure and function of xylem vessels.\n\nXylem vessels are specialized cells in plants that transport water and dissolved minerals from the roots to the rest of the plant. They are composed of dead cells with thick cell walls made primarily of cellulose, which provides structural support.\n\nThe water molecules in xylem vessels are held together by a property known as cohesion. Cohesion is the attraction between water molecules. This property is due to the hydrogen bonding between water molecules. Each water molecule has a hydrogen atom bonded to an electronegative oxygen atom, and the oxygen atom of one water molecule can attract the hydrogen atom of another water molecule, forming a hydrogen bond.\n\nThis hydrogen bonding creates a strong cohesive force between water molecules, allowing them to stick together and form a continuous column of water. This cohesion is crucial for the transport of water from the roots to the leaves, as it allows water to flow through the xylem vessels without leaking out.\n\nThe other options are not responsible for the cohesion of water in xylem vessels:\n\nA. The strong adhesion property of water is not responsible for cohesion. Adhesion refers to the attraction between different substances, such as water and a solid surface, and is not the same as cohesion.\n\nC. The high heat capacity of water is not responsible for cohesion. Heat capacity refers to the amount of heat required to change the temperature of a substance, and it does not affect the cohesion of water molecules.\n\nD. The strong cohesion property of cellulose in the xylem cell wall is not responsible for cohesion. Cellulose provides structural support to the xylem vessels, but it does not contribute to the cohesion of water molecules. The cohesion of water is due to the hydrogen bonding between water molecules, not the cellulose in the cell wall.",
