It is goal-directed.\n- This statement suggests that evolution has a specific purpose or end goal. However, evolution is not goal-directed; it is a natural process driven by random genetic variations and environmental pressures. There is no predetermined endpoint or purpose.\n\nB. It represents the result of selection for acquired characteristics.\n- This statement implies that evolution is about acquiring new traits over time. While natural selection can lead to the development of new traits, evolution is not solely about acquiring new characteristics. It is a broader process that includes genetic drift, mutation, and gene flow.\n\nC. It is synonymous with the process of gene flow.\n- Gene flow refers to the transfer of genetic material between populations, which can lead to genetic variation. While gene flow is an important aspect of evolution, it is not the sole definition of evolution. Evolution encompasses a wide range of processes, including mutation and natural selection.\n\nD. It is the differential survival and reproduction of the most-fit phenotypes.\n- This statement accurately captures the essence of evolution. Evolution is the process by which certain traits become more common in a population over time because they confer a survival or reproductive advantage. This process is driven by natural selection, where individuals with advantageous traits are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing those traits on to their offspring.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the statement that best summarizes evolution as it is viewed today is:\n\nD. It is the differential survival and reproduction of the most-fit phenotypes.",
