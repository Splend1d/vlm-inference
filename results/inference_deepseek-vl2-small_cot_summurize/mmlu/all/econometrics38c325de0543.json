A 99% confidence interval does not guarantee that the true parameter value will be contained within the interval. Instead, it means that if we were to take many samples and construct a confidence interval from each, 99% of those intervals would contain the true parameter value.\n\nB. 99% of the time in repeated samples, the interval would contain the estimated value of the parameter.\n- This statement is also incorrect. A 99% confidence interval does not guarantee that the estimated value of the parameter will be contained within the interval. It only indicates the probability that the interval will contain the true parameter value.\n\nC. 99% of the time in repeated samples, the null hypothesis will be rejected when it was false.\n- This statement is incorrect. A 99% confidence interval does not relate to hypothesis testing. It is a measure of the reliability of an estimate, not a test of a hypothesis.\n\nD. 99% of the time in repeated samples, the null hypothesis will not be rejected when it was false.\n- This statement is correct. A 99% confidence interval indicates that if we were to repeat the sampling process many times, 99% of the intervals constructed would not contain the true parameter value. This means that if the null hypothesis were true, we would not reject it 99% of the time.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate definition of a 99% confidence interval is:\n\nD. 99% of the time in repeated samples, the null hypothesis will not be rejected when it was false.",
