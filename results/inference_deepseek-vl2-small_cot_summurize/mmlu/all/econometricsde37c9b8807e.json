            "content": "To determine which of the given options is an equivalent expression for saying that the explanatory variable is \"non-stochastic,\" we need to understand the concept of stochasticity in the context of regression analysis.\n\nIn regression analysis, a stochastic variable is one that can take on different values in different samples. This means that the variable is subject to random variation. In contrast, a non-stochastic variable is one that does not change across different samples and is therefore predictable.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. The explanatory variable is partly random: This statement suggests that the variable has some degree of randomness, which implies it is stochastic. Therefore, this option is not equivalent to saying the variable is non-stochastic.\n\nB. The explanatory variable is fixed in repeated samples: This statement indicates that the variable does not change across different samples, making it predictable and non-stochastic. This is the correct equivalent expression for a non-stochastic variable.\n\nC. The explanatory variable is correlated with the errors: Correlation between the explanatory variable and errors does not necessarily imply that the variable is stochastic. It could be a non-stochastic variable if the errors are random. Therefore, this option is not equivalent to saying the variable is non-stochastic.\n\nD. The explanatory variable always has a value of one: This statement implies that the variable is fixed at a specific value, which is not stochastic. However, it does not capture the essence of being non-stochastic in the context of regression analysis, as it does not address the variability across samples.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the correct answer is:\n\nB. The explanatory variable is fixed in repeated samples.",
