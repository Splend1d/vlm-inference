It is not related to learning to stop running for cover after repeated exposure to the same object.\n\nB. **Fixed-action pattern**: This is a behavior that is triggered by a specific stimulus and is repeated every time the stimulus is encountered. The duck's behavior of stopping running for cover when the object is passed overhead is a fixed-action pattern because it is a learned response to a specific stimulus.\n\nC. **Agonistic behavior**: This refers to behaviors that are directed towards other individuals of the same species, often involving competition or aggression. The duck's behavior is not directed towards other ducks but rather towards a specific object.\n\nD. **Habituation**: This is a process where an animal becomes less responsive to a stimulus after repeated exposure. While the duck does become less responsive to the object, the behavior described is more accurately characterized as a fixed-action pattern.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Fixed-action pattern.",
