            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the length of a tube and its resonant frequency. The resonant frequency of a tube is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ f_0 = \\frac{v}{2L} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( f_0 \\) is the resonant frequency,\n- \\( v \\) is the speed of sound in the medium (air, in this case),\n- \\( L \\) is the length of the tube.\n\nFor a tube closed at one end, the resonant frequency is half of the resonant frequency of an open tube. This is because the closed end of the tube acts as a node, effectively halving the length of the tube.\n\nGiven that the resonant frequency for an open tube is 256 Hz, the resonant frequency for a closed tube at the same frequency will be:\n\n\\[ f_0 = \\frac{256}{2} = 128 \\text{ Hz} \\]\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\nA. One-quarter the value for a tube open at both ends: This is incorrect because the closed tube's resonant frequency is half of the open tube's, not one-quarter.\n\nB. One-half the value for a tube open at both ends: This is correct. The closed tube's resonant frequency is indeed half of the open tube's.\n\nC. Twice the value for a tube open at both ends: This is incorrect because the closed tube's resonant frequency is not twice the open tube's.\n\nD. Four times the value for a tube open at both ends: This is incorrect because the closed tube's resonant frequency is not four times the open tube's.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. One-half the value for a tube open at both ends.",
