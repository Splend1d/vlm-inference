            "content": "To determine where blood flows from the right ventricle, we need to understand the function of the heart's chambers and the blood vessels they connect to.\n\n1. **Heart Anatomy Overview**: The heart is divided into four chambers: the right atrium, right ventricle, left atrium, and left ventricle. Blood flows through these chambers in a specific sequence, ensuring efficient circulation.\n\n2. **Right Ventricle Function**: The right ventricle pumps deoxygenated blood into the pulmonary arteries. This is crucial because the pulmonary arteries carry blood to the lungs, where gas exchange occurs.\n\n3. **Options Analysis**:\n   - **A. Inferior vena cava**: This is a large vein that carries deoxygenated blood from the lower body to the right atrium, not from the right ventricle.\n   - **B. Left ventricle**: This chamber pumps oxygenated blood into the aorta, which distributes it to the rest of the body, not from the right ventricle.\n   - **C. Pulmonary arteries**: These arteries carry deoxygenated blood from the right ventricle to the lungs for oxygenation. This is the correct answer.\n   - **D. Pulmonary veins**: These veins carry oxygenated blood from the lungs to the left atrium, not from the right ventricle.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Given the function of the right ventricle and the options provided, the correct answer is **C. Pulmonary arteries**. This is where blood flows from the right ventricle after being pumped from the right atrium.",
