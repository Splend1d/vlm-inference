            "content": "Radon is a health hazard because it is a gas that enters the body easily and targets bones because it is chemically similar to calcium.\n\nRadon is a radioactive gas that is naturally present in the environment. It is colorless, odorless, and tasteless, making it difficult to detect. When inhaled, radon can decay into other radioactive substances, such as polonium-210, which can emit alpha particles. These alpha particles can damage lung tissue and increase the risk of lung cancer.\n\nThe reason why radon is particularly hazardous to bones is that it can be inhaled and then decay to form radon-222, which is a gas that can be inhaled and then decay to form radon-220. Radon-220 is a radioactive isotope of radon that can emit alpha particles, which can damage bone tissue and increase the risk of bone cancer.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.",
