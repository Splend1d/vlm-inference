            "content": "To determine the ratio of the concentrations of dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) to acetonitrile (AN) in the mixture, we need to analyze the given 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n1. **Understanding the Spectrum**: The 1H NMR spectrum shows peaks corresponding to the hydrogen atoms in the molecules. The intensity of each peak is proportional to the number of hydrogen atoms in that environment.\n\n2. **Identifying Peaks**: In the spectrum, we see two peaks with relative intensities \u03b1 and 3\u03b1.\n\n3. **Interpreting Intensities**: The intensity of a peak is related to the number of hydrogen atoms in that environment. A peak with intensity \u03b1 indicates that there are \u03b1 hydrogen atoms in that environment, while a peak with intensity 3\u03b1 indicates that there are 3\u03b1 hydrogen atoms.\n\n4. **Relating Intensities to Molecules**: Since the spectrum is for a mixture of DMSO and AN, the peaks correspond to the hydrogen atoms in these molecules.\n\n5. **Calculating the Ratio**:\n   - Let the number of hydrogen atoms in the DMSO environment be x.\n   - Let the number of hydrogen atoms in the AN environment be y.\n   - The peak with intensity \u03b1 corresponds to x hydrogen atoms.\n   - The peak with intensity 3\u03b1 corresponds to 3x hydrogen atoms.\n\n6. **Using the Intensity Ratio**: The ratio of the intensities is given as \u03b1:3\u03b1, which simplifies to 1:3.\n\n7. **Conclusion**: The ratio of the concentrations [DMSO]:[AN] is 1:3.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. 1:3**.",
