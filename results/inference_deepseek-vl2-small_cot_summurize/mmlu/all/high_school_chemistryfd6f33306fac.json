            "content": "To determine which of the given options is not a good measure of relative intermolecular attractive forces, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Heat of fusion**: This is the amount of heat required to change a substance from a solid to a liquid at its melting point. It is directly related to the strength of intermolecular forces because stronger forces require more energy to overcome. Therefore, a higher heat of fusion indicates stronger intermolecular forces.\n\nB. **Boiling points**: The boiling point of a substance is the temperature at which its vapor pressure equals atmospheric pressure. A higher boiling point indicates stronger intermolecular forces because more energy is needed to break the intermolecular bonds and transition from liquid to gas.\n\nC. **Vapor pressures**: Vapor pressure is the pressure exerted by a vapor in equilibrium with its liquid at a given temperature. It is directly related to the strength of intermolecular forces because stronger forces result in higher vapor pressures at a given temperature.\n\nD. **Heat of vaporization**: This is the amount of heat required to change a substance from a liquid to a gas at its boiling point. It is also directly related to the strength of intermolecular forces because stronger forces require more energy to overcome.\n\nGiven this analysis, all the options (A, B, C, and D) are measures of relative intermolecular attractive forces. However, if we consider the question's intent, it might be looking for a measure that is less directly related to intermolecular forces.\n\nUpon closer inspection, the heat of vaporization (D) is not directly related to intermolecular forces. It is more about the energy required to change the state of a substance from liquid to gas, which is influenced by the strength of intermolecular forces but is not a direct measure of them.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Heat of vaporization",
