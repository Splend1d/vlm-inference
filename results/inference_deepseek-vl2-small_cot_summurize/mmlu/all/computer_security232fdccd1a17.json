They are not a prevention method but rather a method to exploit vulnerabilities.\n\nB. **Memory checks**: These are processes used to verify that the memory allocated for a buffer is within expected bounds. They are crucial in preventing buffer overflows by ensuring that the buffer does not exceed its allocated size.\n\nC. **Boundary checks**: These are checks performed to ensure that the data being written to a buffer does not exceed its boundaries. They are essential in preventing buffer overflows by validating the input data.\n\nD. **Buffer checks**: These are checks performed to ensure that the buffer is properly allocated and that it does not contain any unexpected data. They are important in preventing buffer overflows by verifying the integrity of the buffer.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nB. **Memory checks**\n\nMemory checks are crucial in preventing buffer overflows because they ensure that the memory allocated for a buffer is within expected bounds, thereby preventing the possibility of overflows.",
