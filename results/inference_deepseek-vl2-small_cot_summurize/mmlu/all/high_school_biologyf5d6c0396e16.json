            "content": "The transformation of normal mammalian cells into cancer cells in vitro is typically associated with the incorporation of the viral genome into the mammalian cell's nuclear DNA. This process is known as integration. When a virus infects a cell, it can integrate its genetic material into the host cell's DNA, which can lead to the activation of oncogenes or the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes, resulting in uncontrolled cell growth and the formation of cancer cells.\n\nOption A, the formation of a pilus between the mammalian cell and the virus, is not directly related to the transformation of cells into cancer cells. Pili are structures on the surface of some viruses that help them attach to host cells, but they do not cause the transformation of cells into cancer cells.\n\nOption C, the conversion of the host's genome into the viral DNA, is not a process that occurs during the transformation of cells into cancer cells. Viral DNA is not integrated into the host cell's genome in the same way that viral RNA is transcribed into viral proteins.\n\nOption D, the release of spores into the mammalian cell, is not a process that occurs during the transformation of cells into cancer cells. Spores are a form of viral resistance and are not involved in the transformation process.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Incorporation of the viral genome into the mammalian cell's nuclear DNA.",
