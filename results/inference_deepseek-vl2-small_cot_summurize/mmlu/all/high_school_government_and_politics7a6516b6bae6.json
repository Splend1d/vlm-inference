            "content": "Let's analyze each statement to determine which one is false.\n\nA. Only Congress can pass laws.\n- This statement is true. The U.S. Constitution grants Congress the exclusive power to make laws. This is a fundamental principle of the separation of powers in the U.S. government.\n\nB. A proposed amendment must be approved by two-thirds of the delegates in both houses of Congress.\n- This statement is true. The process for amending the U.S. Constitution requires a two-thirds majority vote in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. This ensures that significant changes to the Constitution are not made lightly.\n\nC. Congress can override a presidential veto if two-thirds of the House and Senate agree to do so.\n- This statement is true. The U.S. Constitution allows Congress to override a presidential veto with a two-thirds majority vote in both the House and the Senate. This is a check on the president's power to veto legislation.\n\nD. Congressional power over the bureaucracy is less than that of the president.\n- This statement is false. While the president has significant influence over the bureaucracy through appointments and executive orders, Congress also plays a crucial role. Congress has the power to confirm or reject presidential appointments, and it can influence the bureaucracy through budgetary control and oversight.\n\nTherefore, the statement that is false is D. Congressional power over the bureaucracy is less than that of the president.",
