            "content": "To determine which features are common to all fresh impact craters, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Ejecta**: Ejecta refers to the material that is expelled from a crater during an impact event. This material can include fragments of the impactor and the target material. Ejecta is a common feature in fresh craters because it results from the forceful interaction between the impactor and the surface.\n\nB. **Raised rims**: The raised rims of an impact crater are formed by the material that is displaced during the impact. This displacement creates a rim that is higher than the surrounding terrain. Raised rims are a characteristic feature of fresh craters because they indicate the presence of a recent impact.\n\nC. **Central peaks**: Central peaks are formed when the impactor is large enough to penetrate the surface and create a mound of material at the center of the crater. This feature is common in fresh craters because it results from the energy and force of the impact.\n\nD. **A and B only**: This option suggests that only ejecta and raised rims are common features. However, central peaks are also a common feature in fresh craters, so this option is incorrect.\n\nGiven the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nD. A and B only\n\nThis is because both ejecta and raised rims are common features of fresh impact craters, while central peaks are also a common feature.",
