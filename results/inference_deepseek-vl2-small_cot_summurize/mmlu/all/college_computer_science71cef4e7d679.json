            "content": "In an object-oriented language where all entities are objects, the method resolution process involves several steps to locate and execute a method on an object. Here\u2019s a detailed breakdown of the process:\n\n1. **Instance Link**: The first step is to determine the class of the object. This is done by following the instance link, which is a pointer to the object's class. The instance link points to the class definition, which contains the method definitions.\n\n2. **Subclass Links**: Once the class of the object is determined, the next step is to follow the subclass links. These links are pointers to the superclasses of the object's class. The subclass links are used to navigate through the inheritance hierarchy to find the superclass of the object's class.\n\n3. **Method Resolution**: The method resolution process involves traversing the inheritance hierarchy to find the method that matches the method name and signature requested by the object. This is done by following the subclass links until the method is found.\n\nGiven this process, the correct answer is:\n\nB. one or more instance links and then one or more subclass links\n\nThis is because the method is first located by following the instance link to the class definition, and then by following the subclass links to navigate through the inheritance hierarchy to find the method.",
