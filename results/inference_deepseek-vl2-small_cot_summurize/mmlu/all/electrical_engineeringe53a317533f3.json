The poles and zeros of an LC network are typically located on the imaginary axis in the complex plane. This is because the poles and zeros of an LC network are determined by the resonant frequency and the quality factor, which are purely imaginary numbers.\n\n2. **RC Network**: This network consists of resistors (R) and capacitors (C). The poles and zeros of an RC network are typically located on the real axis in the complex plane. This is because the poles and zeros of an RC network are determined by the natural frequency and the damping factor, which are real numbers.\n\n3. **RL Network**: This network consists of resistors (R) and inductors (L). The poles and zeros of an RL network are typically located on the imaginary axis in the complex plane. This is because the poles and zeros of an RL network are determined by the natural frequency and the damping factor, which are purely imaginary numbers.\n\nGiven that the poles and zeros are arranged alternatively on the negative real axis, we can conclude that the network is either an RC network or an RL network.\n\n- **RC Network**: Poles and zeros are on the real axis.\n- **RL Network**: Poles and zeros are on the imaginary axis.\n\nSince the poles and zeros are on the negative real axis, the network must be an RC network.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB.
