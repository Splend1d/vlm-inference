Each number is less than or equal to 12.\n\nFirst, let's list the multiples of 60 and check which ones are less than or equal to 12:\n- The multiples of 60 are: 60, 120, 180, 240, 300, 360, 420, 480, 540, 600, 660, 720, 780, 840, 900, 960, 1020, 1080, 1140, 1200.\n\nWe need to find two numbers from this list that are less than or equal to 12 and have a GCF of 2.\n\nLet's check the pairs of numbers from the list:\n- \\(60 \\div 2 = 30\\) (GCF is 2)\n- \\(120 \\div 2 = 60\\) (GCF is 2)\n- \\(180 \\div 2 = 90\\) (GCF is 2)\n- \\(240 \\div 2 = 120\\) (GCF is 2)\n- \\(300 \\div 2 = 150\\) (GCF is 2)\n- \\(360 \\div 2 = 180\\) (GCF is 2)\n- \\(420 \\div 2 = 210\\) (GCF is 2)\n- \\(480 \\div 2 = 240\\) (GCF is 2)\n- \\(540 \\div 2 = 270\\) (GCF is 2)\n- \\(600 \\div 2 = 300\\) (GCF is 2)\n- \\(660 \\div 2 = 330\\) (GCF is 2)\n- \\(720 \\div 2 = 360\\) (GCF is 2)\n- \\(780 \\div 2 = 390\\) (GCF is 2)\n- \\(840 \\div 2 = 420\\) (GCF is 2)\n- \\(900 \\div 2 = 450\\) (GCF is 2)\n- \\(960 \\div 2 = 480\\) (GCF is 2)\n- \\(1020 \\div 2 = 510\\) (GCF is 2)\n- \\(1080 \\div 2 = 540\\) (GCF is 2)\n- \\(1140 \\div 2 = 570\\) (GCF is 2)\n- \\(1200 \\div 2 = 600\\) (GCF is 2)\n\nFrom the list, the pairs of numbers that are less than or equal to 12 and have a GCF of 2 are:\n- \\(60\\) and \\(120\\)\n- \\(180\\) and \\(360\\)\n- \\(240\\) and \\(480\\)\n- \\(300\\) and \\(600\\)\n- \\(360\\) and \\(720\\)\n- \\(420\\) and \\(840\\)\n- \\(480\\) and \\(960\\)\n- \\(540\\) and \\(1080\\)\n- \\(600\\) and \\(1200\\)\n\nAmong these pairs, the only pair that fits the criteria and is less than or equal to 12 is:\n- \\(60\\) and \\(120\\)\n\nThus, the two numbers are \\(60\\) and \\(120\\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{B}\n\\]",
