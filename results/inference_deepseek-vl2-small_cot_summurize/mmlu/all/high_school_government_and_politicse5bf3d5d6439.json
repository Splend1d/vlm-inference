Committee members often lose track of their constituents' priorities because of their frequent contact with special-interest lobbyists.\n\nHere's why:\n\nA. The membership of committees often overrepresents constituencies with the greatest stake in the committee's business. This is not necessarily true. While it's possible that some committees may overrepresent certain interests, it's not a universal characteristic of all committees.\n\nB. Most committees are too small to include representatives of all popular opinions. This is not necessarily true. While it's possible that some committees may be too small, it's not a universal characteristic of all committees.\n\nC. The minority party controls nearly half of all committees. This is not necessarily true. While it's possible that the minority party may control some committees, it's not a universal characteristic of all committees.\n\nD. Committee members often lose track of their constituents' priorities because of their frequent contact with special-interest lobbyists. This is true. Committee members often have to balance the interests of their constituents with the interests of special-interest lobbyists. This can lead to a disconnect between the priorities of the constituents and the priorities of the committee members.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. Committee members often lose track of their constituents' priorities because of their frequent contact with special-interest lobbyists.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{D}$",
