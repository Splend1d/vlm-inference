The modulus operator (%) returns the remainder of the division of the first operand by the second operand. In this case, 3 divided by 3 is 1 with a remainder of 0. Therefore, 3 % 3 = 0.\n\n2. The expression 1 + 0 is then evaluated. The addition operator (+) adds the two operands together. In this case, 1 + 0 = 1.\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression 1 + 3 % 3 is 1. The correct answer is B.",
