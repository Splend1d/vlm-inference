It is a political and social movement that emphasizes the importance of national identity and the unity of a nation. Nationalism often involves a sense of pride in one's country and a desire to protect and promote its interests.\n\nA. regionalism is not the correct answer because it refers to the idea of regional identity and loyalty, rather than national identity.\n\nB. diffusion is not the correct answer because it refers to the spread of ideas, cultures, or technologies from one place to another, rather than the identification with a nation-state.\n\nC. iconography is not the correct answer because it refers to the study of symbols and their meanings, rather than the identification with a nation-state.",
