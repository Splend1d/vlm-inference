N \u00b7 ~Q\n\nLet's evaluate each proposition step by step.\n\n### Proposition 1: ~N \u2261 (O \u00b7 P)\n- If N is false, then ~N is true.\n- If ~N is true, then (O \u00b7 P) must be true.\n- If (O \u00b7 P) is true, then O must be true and P must be true.\n\n### Proposition 2: ~O \u2283 Q\n- If ~O is true, then O must be false.\n- If O is false, then Q must be true.\n\n### Proposition 3: N \u00b7 ~Q\n- If N is true, then ~Q must be true.\n- If ~Q is true, then Q must be false.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the set of propositions using the truth values of N, O, and P:\n\n1. **N is true:**\n   - ~N is false.\n   - (O \u00b7 P) is false.\n   - N \u00b7 ~Q is true.\n\n2. **N is false:**\n   - ~N is true.\n   - (O \u00b7 P) is true.\n   - N \u00b7 ~Q is true.\n\n3. **O is true:**\n   - ~O is false.\n   - Q is false.\n   - N \u00b7 ~Q is true.\n\n4. **O is false:**\n   - ~O is true.\n   - Q is true.\n   - N \u00b7 ~Q is true.\n\n5. **P is true:**\n   - (O \u00b7 P) is true.\n   - Q is false.\n   - N \u00b7 ~Q is true.\n\n6. **P is false:**\n   - (O \u00b7 P) is false.\n   - Q is false.\n   - N \u00b7 ~Q is true.\n\n### Consistency Check:\n- In all cases, N \u00b7 ~Q is true.\n- In all cases, ~O \u2283 Q is true.\n\nSince N \u00b7 ~Q is true in all cases, the set of propositions is consistent.\n\n### Consistent Valuation:\n- When N is true and O and P are true, and Q is false, N \u00b7 ~Q is true.\n- When N is false and O and P are true, and Q is false, N \u00b7 ~Q is true.\n- When O is true and P is true, and Q is false, N \u00b7 ~Q is true.\n- When O is false and P is true, and Q is false, N \u00b7 ~Q is true.\n- When P is true and Q is false, N \u00b7 ~Q is true.\n- When P is false and Q is false, N \u00b7 ~Q is true.\n\nThus, the consistent valuation is when N is true and O and P are true, and Q is false.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nB.
