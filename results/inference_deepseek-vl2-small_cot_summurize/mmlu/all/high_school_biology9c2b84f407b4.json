            "content": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Only acidic substances can undergo enzymatic processing in lysosomes.\n- This statement is incorrect because the pH of the lysosome is 5, which is acidic, but it does not mean that only acidic substances can be processed. Enzymes in lysosomes are active at this pH, but they can also process a variety of substrates, including non-acidic ones.\n\nB. Most enzymes in the lysosome are incapable of catalyzing substrates inside the lysosome.\n- This statement is correct. The pH of the lysosome is 5, which is below the normal pH of the cytosol (7.2). Enzymes that are active at this pH are typically found in lysosomes, but they are not capable of catalyzing substrates at the normal pH of the cytosol. This is because the enzymes are adapted to function optimally at the lower pH of the lysosome.\n\nC. Enzymes in the lysosome are released to the cytosol.\n- This statement is incorrect. The enzymes in the lysosome are not released to the cytosol. Instead, they are kept within the lysosome to maintain the acidic environment necessary for their activity.\n\nD. Protons are actively pumped into the lysosome.\n- This statement is incorrect. While the lysosome does maintain a low pH, it is not due to active proton pumping. Instead, the lysosome contains enzymes that can break down various substrates, including proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, and these enzymes are active at the low pH of the lysosome.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Most enzymes in the lysosome are incapable of catalyzing substrates inside the lysosome.",
