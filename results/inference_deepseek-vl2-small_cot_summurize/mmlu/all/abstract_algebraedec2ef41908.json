Therefore, the kernel of any homomorphism from \\( G \\) to \\( H \\) is the trivial group, which is empty.\n- Thus, it is possible for a homomorphism to have an empty kernel.\n\n**Statement 2: It is not possible to have a nontrivial homomorphism of some finite group into some infinite group.**\n\n- A homomorphism \\( f: G \\to H \\) between groups \\( G \\) and \\( H \\) is nontrivial if it is not the identity function.\n- Consider the group \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) (the group of integers under addition) and the group \\( \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\) (the group of integers modulo 2 under addition).\n- The group \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) is infinite, and the group \\( \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\) is finite.\n- There exists a nontrivial homomorphism from \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) to \\( \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\). For example, the homomorphism \\( f(n) = 2n \\mod 2 \\) is a nontrivial homomorphism from \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) to \\( \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\).\n- Therefore, it is possible to have a nontrivial homomorphism from a finite group to an infinite group.\n\nGiven the analysis:\n\n- Statement 1 is true.\n- Statement 2 is false.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nC.
