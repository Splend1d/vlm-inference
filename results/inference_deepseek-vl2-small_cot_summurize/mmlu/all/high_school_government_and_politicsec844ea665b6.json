Impeachment, conviction, and removal from office by Congress: This option is not applicable to federal judges. Impeachment is a process used to remove federal officials, including the President, from office, and it is not a disciplinary action for judges.\n\nB. Removal from office by the appointing president: This option is also not applicable to federal judges. The appointing president can remove a judge from office, but this is not a disciplinary action. It is a removal process that can occur for various reasons, including judicial incapacity or misconduct.\n\nC. Removal from office by the president-elect: This option is not applicable to federal judges. The president-elect does not have the authority to remove a judge from office.\n\nD. Recall elections by citizens residing in the district over which the judge has jurisdiction: This option is correct. Federal judges can be removed from office through recall elections. This process allows citizens to vote on whether to remove a judge from office, typically for misconduct or incapacity.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Recall elections by citizens residing in the district over which the judge has jurisdiction.",
