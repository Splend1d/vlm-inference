            "content": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Increased when intracellular ADP rises.**\n   - Creatine kinase is an enzyme that catalyzes the reversible transfer of a phosphate group from creatine to ADP, forming creatine and ADP. This reaction is highly sensitive to changes in the concentration of ADP. When ADP levels rise, indicating a high energy demand, creatine kinase activity increases to facilitate the replenishment of ATP. Therefore, this statement is correct.\n\nB. **Increased when muscle pH falls below 6.9.**\n   - Creatine kinase activity is not directly influenced by muscle pH. Creatine kinase is more sensitive to changes in ADP concentration rather than pH levels. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\nC. **Always lower in Type II fibres than Type I fibres.**\n   - Creatine kinase activity is generally higher in Type II fibers compared to Type I fibers. This is because Type II fibers are more glycolytic and rely more on creatine phosphate for ATP production, necessitating higher creatine kinase activity. Thus, this statement is incorrect.\n\nD. **Increased after a period of endurance training.**\n   - While endurance training can lead to adaptations in muscle fibers, it does not directly increase creatine kinase activity. Creatine kinase levels are more influenced by the physiological demands of the activity rather than training itself. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\nAfter evaluating each option, the correct answer is:\n\nA. increased when intracellular ADP rises.",
