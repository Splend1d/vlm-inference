            "content": "To determine which option best describes the concept of greater fitness, we need to understand what fitness means in the context of evolution and natural selection. Fitness is a measure of an organism's ability to survive and reproduce in its environment. It is a key concept in evolutionary biology and is often used to compare the reproductive success of different individuals within a species.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Living longer than others of its species: While longevity can be an indicator of fitness, it is not the primary measure. An organism can live longer but still have lower reproductive success, which would not make it more fit.\n\nB. Competing for resources more successfully than others of its species: This option focuses on resource acquisition, which is important for survival but not directly related to reproductive success.\n\nC. Mating more frequently than others of its species: While mating frequency can be an indicator of reproductive success, it does not necessarily mean the organism is more fit. It could be due to other factors such as social status or access to mates.\n\nD. Leaving more viable offspring than others of its species: This option directly relates to reproductive success, which is the primary measure of fitness. An organism that leaves more viable offspring is more likely to pass on its genes to the next generation, thereby increasing its genetic contribution to the species.\n\nConsidering these analyses, the correct answer is D. Leaving more viable offspring than others of its species. This option best captures the essence of fitness as it directly relates to reproductive success, which is the ultimate goal of any organism in the context of evolution.",
