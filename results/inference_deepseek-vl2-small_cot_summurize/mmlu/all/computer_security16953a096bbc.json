This token is not stored on the user's computer, and it does not rely on the computer's operating system or any software to generate the second factor. Therefore, even if malware were to compromise the user's computer, it would not be able to access the second factor stored on the U2F token. This statement is true.\n\n**Statement 2:** A server using U2F can reliably determine that the user who is attempting to login is indeed behind the computer that sent the login request.\n\n- **Analysis:** U2F technology relies on the authenticity of the user's device, not the server. The server cannot determine the user's device identity; it only verifies the second factor provided by the user. Therefore, the server cannot reliably determine that the user is behind the computer that sent the login request. This statement is false.\n\nGiven the analysis:\n\n- Statement 1 is true.\n- Statement 2 is false.\n\nThus, the correct answer is **C. True, False**.",
