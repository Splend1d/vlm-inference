            "content": "To determine which statements are true for cointegrated variables, we need to understand the concept of cointegration and its implications.\n\n1. **Statement (i): $x_t$ and $y_t$ must both be stationary.**\n\n   Cointegrated variables are defined as variables that are not linearly related in the long run but are related in the short run. This means that while they may not be stationary individually, their linear combination can be stationary. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n2. **Statement (ii): Only one linear combination of $x_t$ and $y_t$ will be stationary.**\n\n   This statement is true. If two variables are cointegrated, their linear combination can be stationary. This is because the cointegrating equation, which describes the long-run relationship between the two variables, can be used to create a linear combination that is stationary.\n\n3. **Statement (iii): The cointegrating equation for $x_t$ and $y_t$ describes the short-run relationship between the two series.**\n\n   This statement is false. The cointegrating equation describes the long-run relationship between the two variables, not the short-run relationship. The short-run relationship is captured by the residuals of a regression of $y_t$ on $x_t$.\n\n4. **Statement (iv): The residuals of a regression of $y_t$ on $x_t$ must be stationary.**\n\n   This statement is true. The residuals of a regression of $y_t$ on $x_t$ are the short-run deviations from the cointegrating relationship. If these residuals are stationary, it indicates that the short-run relationship is stable and consistent with the long-run cointegrating relationship.\n\nBased on the analysis, the true statements are (ii) and (iv). Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. (ii) and (iv) only",
