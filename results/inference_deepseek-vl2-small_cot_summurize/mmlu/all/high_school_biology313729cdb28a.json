            "content": "To determine which components are part of invertebrate immune systems, we need to understand the basic structure and function of these systems.\n\n1. **Cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (Option A)**: These are a type of T-cell found in vertebrates. They are responsible for killing infected or cancerous cells. Invertebrates, such as insects and arthropods, do not have a T-cell system in the same way that vertebrates do.\n\n2. **Phagocytes (Option B)**: Phagocytes are a type of white blood cell that engulf and digest pathogens and cellular debris. Invertebrates, including insects, crustaceans, and mollusks, have phagocytic cells that play a crucial role in their immune response. These cells are essential for defending against infections and are a key component of their immune systems.\n\n3. **B-cells (Option C)**: B-cells are a type of white blood cell that produces antibodies. While some invertebrates have B-cells, they are not as prominent as in vertebrates. The role of B-cells in invertebrate immunity is less significant compared to their role in vertebrates.\n\n4. **Helper T-cells (Option D)**: Helper T-cells are also a type of T-cell found in vertebrates. They assist other immune cells in mounting an effective response against pathogens. Invertebrates do not have a similar helper T-cell system.\n\nConsidering the above analysis, the correct answer is **B. Phagocytes**. Phagocytes are a fundamental part of invertebrate immune systems, playing a significant role in defending against infections.",
