In meiosis, the separation of sister chromatids occurs during the second division, whereas in mitosis, the separation of sister chromatids occurs during the first division.\n\nHere's a brief explanation of each option:\n\nA. This is incorrect. In meiosis, there are two rounds of cell division (meiosis I and meiosis II), while in mitosis, there is only one round of cell division.\n\nB. This is correct. In meiosis, the separation of sister chromatids occurs during the second division (meiosis II), while in mitosis, the separation of sister chromatids occurs during the first division (mitosis I).\n\nC. This is incorrect. Chromosomes are replicated during interphase in both meiosis and mitosis, not during prophase.\n\nD. This is incorrect. In mitosis, spindle fibers form during prophase, not metaphase. In metaphase, the spindle fibers align the chromosomes at the cell's equatorial plane.",
