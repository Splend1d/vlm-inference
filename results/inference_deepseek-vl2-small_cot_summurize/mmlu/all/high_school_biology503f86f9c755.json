The two varieties of mice descended from a recent common ancestor.\nB. The mouse population was originally one population that diverged into two species because of mutations.\nC. Selection favors some phenotypes over others.\nD. Originally the mice were all dark colored.

            "content": "To determine the correct statement, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. The two varieties of mice descended from a recent common ancestor.\n- This statement suggests that the two varieties of mice are closely related and share a recent common ancestor. However, the scenario does not provide information about the evolutionary history or the time frame of their divergence. Therefore, we cannot conclude that they descended from a recent common ancestor based solely on the given information.\n\nB. The mouse population was originally one population that diverged into two species because of mutations.\n- This statement implies that the two varieties of mice are two separate species that diverged from a single ancestral population due to mutations. However, the scenario does not provide any evidence of mutations leading to the divergence of the two varieties. It only describes the physical characteristics of the mice in different environments.\n\nC. Selection favors some phenotypes over others.\n- This statement suggests that the environment (lava formations vs. desert) favors certain mouse phenotypes (dark vs. light colors). While it is possible that environmental factors could influence the coloration of mice, the scenario does not provide any information about the selective pressures acting on the mice. Therefore, we cannot conclude that selection favors some phenotypes over others based on the given information.\n\nD. Originally the mice were all dark colored. As the lava decomposed into sand, the color of some mice changed because that color was favored in that environment.\n- This statement suggests that the original coloration of the mice was dark, and as the lava decomposed into sand, the color of some mice changed to light because that color was favored in the sandy environment. This statement is consistent with the scenario, as it explains the observed coloration differences between the lava formations and the desert.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct statement is:\n\nD. Originally the mice were all dark colored. As the lava decomposed into sand, the color of some mice changed because that color was favored in that environment.",
