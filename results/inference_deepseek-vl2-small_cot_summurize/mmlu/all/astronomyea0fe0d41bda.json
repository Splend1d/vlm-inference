            "content": "To understand why the plasma tail of a comet always points away from the Sun, we need to consider the forces and dynamics involved.\n\n- **Option A: Radiation pressure from the Sun's light pushes the ions away.**\n  - While radiation pressure from the Sun does affect the tail, it is not the primary reason the tail always points away from the Sun. The tail's orientation is more related to the conservation of angular momentum.\n\n- **Option B: The conservation of the angular momentum in the tail keeps it always pointing away from the Sun.**\n  - This is the correct answer. The tail of a comet is composed of ions and electrons that are moving away from the Sun. As the comet moves, the tail stretches out behind it. The conservation of angular momentum dictates that the angular momentum of the system (the comet and its tail) remains constant. As the comet moves away from the Sun, the tail must also move away to maintain this conservation. This results in the tail always pointing away from the Sun.\n\n- **Option C: The ions are following Keplerian orbits that lead away from the Sun.**\n  - While the ions do follow a path that is influenced by the Sun's gravity, this does not explain why the tail always points away from the Sun. The tail's orientation is determined by the conservation of angular momentum, not the specific orbits of the ions.\n\n- **Option D: The solar wind electromagnetically \"blows\" the ions directly away from the Sun.**\n  - The solar wind does contribute to the tail's formation and movement, but it is not the primary reason the tail always points away from the Sun. The solar wind's electromagnetic forces are part of the overall dynamics, but the conservation of angular momentum is the key factor.\n\nIn conclusion, the tail of a comet always points away from the Sun due to the conservation of angular momentum, which ensures that the angular momentum of the system remains constant as the comet moves away from the Sun.",
