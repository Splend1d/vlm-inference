All of these\n\nIn a vacuum, an object has no buoyant force, mass, or weight. \n\n- **Buoyant force** is the force exerted by a fluid that opposes the weight of an object immersed in it. Since there is no fluid in a vacuum, there is no buoyant force.\n- **Mass** is a measure of the amount of matter in an object and is a fundamental property that does not depend on the presence of a medium. Therefore, an object in a vacuum still has mass.\n- **Weight** is the force exerted on an object by gravity. In a vacuum, there is no gravitational force acting on the object, so the object has no weight.\n\nThus, all the options (A, B, and C) are incorrect in the context of a vacuum.",
