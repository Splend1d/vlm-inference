            "content": "To determine which bones develop by endochondral ossification, we need to understand the process of bone development. Bone development occurs through two primary processes: endochondral ossification and intramembranous ossification.\n\nEndochondral ossification is a process where cartilage is replaced by bone. This process is primarily responsible for the formation of long bones, such as the femur, humerus, and tibia. It is also involved in the development of certain flat bones, like the ribs and sternum.\n\nIntramembranous ossification, on the other hand, is a direct process where bone forms directly from mesenchymal tissue without the need for a cartilage stage. This process is responsible for the formation of flat bones such as the skull, clavicle, and vertebrae.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. The ribs - Ribs develop by endochondral ossification. They start as cartilage and are gradually replaced by bone.\n\nB. The ribs and sternum - Both the ribs and sternum develop by endochondral ossification. The sternum is a flat bone that forms from cartilage.\n\nC. The ribs, sternum, and clavicle - The clavicle develops by intramembranous ossification, not endochondral ossification.\n\nD. The ribs, sternum, clavicle, and vertebrae - The vertebrae develop by intramembranous ossification, not endochondral ossification.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. The ribs and sternum develop by endochondral ossification.",
