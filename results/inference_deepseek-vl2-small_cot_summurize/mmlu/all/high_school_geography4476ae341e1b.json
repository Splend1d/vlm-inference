It includes both a horizontal (latitude) and a vertical (longitude) component. In this case, \"479 Elm Street, Muncie, Indiana\" is an absolute location because it provides a specific address that can be used to locate a particular place on Earth.\n\nLet's analyze the other options:\n\nA. 10 miles east of Pittsburgh - This is a relative location because it describes a position in relation to another place (Pittsburgh). It does not provide a specific coordinate.\n\nB. Washington - This is a relative location as well, as it refers to a city without specifying its exact position.\n\nC. 3 degrees south - This is a relative location because it describes a position in relation to the equator. It does not provide a specific coordinate.\n\nTherefore, the only item that is an absolute location is D. 479 Elm Street, Muncie, Indiana.",
