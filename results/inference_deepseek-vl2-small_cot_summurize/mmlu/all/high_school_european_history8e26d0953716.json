If anyone habitually living at Court absented himself he insisted on knowing the reason; those who came there only for flying visits had also to give a satisfactory explanation; anyone who seldom or never appeared there was certain to incur his displeasure. If asked to bestow a favor on such persons he would reply haughtily: \"I do not know him\"; of such as rarely presented themselves he would say, \"He is a man I never see\"; and from these judgments there was no appeal.\nNo one understood better than Louis XIV the art of enhancing the value of a favor by his manner of bestowing it; he knew how to make the most of a word, a smile, even of a glance.\nHe loved splendor, magnificence, and profusion in all things, and encouraged similar tastes in his Court; to spend money freely on equipages and buildings, on feasting and at cards, was a sure way to gain his favor, perhaps to obtain the honor of a word from him. Motives of policy had something to do with this; by making expensive habits the fashion, and, for people in a certain position, a necessity, he compelled his courtiers to live beyond their income, and gradually reduced them to depend on his bounty for the means of subsistence.\n\u2014Duke Saint-Simon, Memoirs of Louis XIV and His Court and His Regency, c. 1750\nWhich of the following was the greatest weakness and regret of the rule of King Louis XIV?\n\nA. His domination of the nobility left him without friends and allies.\nB. He was so concerned with ceremonies and appearances that he did not rule his country well.\nC. He left the administration of his kingdom to professional bureaucrats known as intendants.\nD. He was at war for 2/3 of his reign and united the other major powers against him.\n",

            "content": "The question asks for the greatest weakness and regret of the rule of King Louis XIV. \n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. His domination of the nobility left him without friends and allies. This option suggests that Louis XIV's dominance over the nobility led to a lack of friends and allies. However, the text does not provide any information to support this claim.\n\nB. He was so concerned with ceremonies and appearances that he did not rule his country well. This option suggests that Louis XIV's focus on ceremonies and appearances led to poor governance. The text does mention that Louis XIV was quick to notice the absence of those of inferior degree and used to cast his eyes to right and left, but it does not suggest that this led to poor governance.\n\nC. He left the administration of his kingdom to professional bureaucrats known as intendants. This option suggests that Louis XIV's decision to leave the administration of his kingdom to professional bureaucrats was a weakness. The text does mention that Louis XIV made expensive habits the fashion and reduced his courtiers to depend on his bounty for the means of subsistence, which could be interpreted as a form of delegation of administrative duties.\n\nD. He was at war for 2/3 of his reign and united the other major powers against him. This option suggests that Louis XIV's extensive military campaigns were a weakness. The text does not provide any information to support this claim.\n\nBased on the analysis, option C seems to be the most plausible answer. The text suggests that Louis XIV's decision to delegate administrative duties to professional bureaucrats could be seen as a weakness.\n\nSo, the final answer is $\\boxed{C}$.",
