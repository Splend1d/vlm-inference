            "content": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option in the context of the question:\n\nA. **Be led by a group of commissioners representing both major political parties**: This option suggests that the leadership of the agency is balanced by representatives from both major political parties. This could potentially reduce political influence by ensuring that no single party has complete control over the agency's leadership. However, it does not directly address the issue of political influence on policy-making.\n\nB. **Plan policy cooperatively with the appropriate congressional committees**: This option implies that the agency collaborates with congressional committees to plan policies. While this could involve input from various political perspectives, it does not necessarily ensure that the agency is protected from political influence. The agency might still be influenced by the political priorities of the committees.\n\nC. **Reapply for funding at the end of each fiscal year**: This option suggests a mechanism for accountability and oversight. By requiring agencies to reapply for funding, Congress can evaluate the agency's performance and influence. This process can help ensure that the agency remains focused on its mission and is not swayed by political pressures. It is a practical way to maintain oversight and accountability, which can protect the agency from political influence.\n\nD. **Submit all planned policy changes to the president for approval**: This option implies that the agency must seek approval from the president for any policy changes. While this could provide some level of oversight, it does not necessarily protect the agency from political influence. The president could still exert influence over the agency's decisions.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the most effective way to protect independent regulatory agencies from political influence is through option C: **reapply for funding at the end of each fiscal year**. This process allows Congress to evaluate the agency's performance and ensure that it remains focused on its mission, thereby protecting it from political influence.",
