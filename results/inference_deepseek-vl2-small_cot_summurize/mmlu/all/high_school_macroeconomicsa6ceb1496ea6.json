GDP is calculated as the total value of all final goods and services produced within a country's borders during a specific period, regardless of who produces them. This means that GDP includes production by both domestic and foreign entities within the country's borders.\n\nB. **Production by a nation's citizens wherever they may be.**\n   - This option suggests that GDP should include production by citizens regardless of where they are located. However, GDP is concerned with the location of production, not the nationality of the producers. Therefore, this option is incorrect because it does not align with the territoriality principle of GDP.\n\nC. **Income earned by the factors of production plus depreciation and indirect business taxes.**\n   - This option describes the components of GDP, which include income earned by factors of production (labor, capital, land, and entrepreneurship) and subtracts depreciation (the reduction in value of capital goods) and indirect business taxes. While this is a correct description of GDP, it does not directly measure GDP itself.\n\nD. **(A) and (C)**\n   - This option combines the territoriality principle (A) with the components of GDP (C). While this is a correct description of GDP, it does not directly measure GDP itself.\n\nGiven the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Production within a nation's borders.",
