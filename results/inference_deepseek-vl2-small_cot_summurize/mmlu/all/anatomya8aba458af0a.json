They are characterized by their small size and lack of a nucleus, which is a defining feature of lymphocytes.\n\nB. **Monocyte**: These are also a type of white blood cell, but they are larger than lymphocytes and have a nucleus. Monocytes are involved in phagocytosis and help in the immune response.\n\nC. **Erythrocyte**: Also known as red blood cells, these cells are responsible for carrying oxygen throughout the body. Erythrocytes are unique because they lack a nucleus and contain hemoglobin, which gives them their red color.\n\nD. **Basophil**: These are a type of white blood cell involved in the inflammatory response. They have a nucleus and granules in their cytoplasm, which are used in immune reactions.\n\nBy analyzing the characteristics of each cell type, we can conclude that:\n\n- Lymphocytes (A) and erythrocytes (C) do not have a nucleus.\n- Monocytes (B) and basophils (D) do have a nucleus.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Lymphocyte\nC. Erythrocyte",
