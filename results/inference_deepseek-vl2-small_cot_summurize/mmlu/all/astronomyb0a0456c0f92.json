            "content": "To determine which of the options are NOT caused by orbital resonance, let's analyze each one:\n\nA. **2:3 periodic ratio of Neptune:Pluto**\n   - This is a classic example of orbital resonance. Neptune and Pluto have a 2:3 orbital resonance, meaning Neptune completes two orbits around the Sun for every three orbits Pluto makes. This resonance causes gravitational interactions that can affect their orbits and stability.\n\nB. **Kirkwood Gaps**\n   - Kirkwood gaps are regions in the asteroid belt where there are fewer asteroids. These gaps are caused by orbital resonances with Jupiter. As Jupiter's gravitational influence causes objects in the asteroid belt to be ejected or trapped in specific orbits, creating gaps.\n\nC. **Gaps in Saturn's rings**\n   - Similar to Kirkwood gaps, gaps in Saturn's rings are also caused by orbital resonances with Jupiter. Jupiter's gravitational influence can clear out material in certain regions, creating gaps in the rings.\n\nD. **Breaking of small Jovian moons to form ring materials**\n   - This is not caused by orbital resonance. The breaking of small Jovian moons to form ring materials is primarily due to tidal forces. Tidal forces are the result of a body's gravitational pull on another body, causing it to be stretched and sometimes broken apart.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. The breaking of small Jovian moons to form ring materials is NOT caused by orbital resonance.",
