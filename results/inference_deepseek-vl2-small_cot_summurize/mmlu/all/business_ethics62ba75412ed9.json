While they can influence decision-making, they are not specifically about desirable behaviors and goals.\n\nB. **Personal values** are deeply held beliefs about what is important in life. They are stable over time and guide decision-making by determining what is considered right or wrong, good or bad. Personal values are directly related to desirable behaviors and goals.\n\nC. **Personal attitudes** are opinions or feelings about a particular subject. They can change over time and are not necessarily stable. They may influence decision-making but are not the same as stable beliefs about desirable behaviors and goals.\n\nD. **Personal traits** are characteristics that define an individual, such as intelligence or creativity. While they can influence behavior, they are not specifically about desirable behaviors and goals.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is **B. Personal values**. Personal values are the beliefs about desirable behaviors and goals that are stable over time and influence decision-making.",
