This is because the patient may need to use the catheter for a longer period at night, and a larger bag can accommodate this extended use without needing to be emptied as frequently.\n\n- A. 350ml: This is a relatively small size and would not be sufficient for nighttime use, as it would need to be emptied more often.\n- B. 500ml: While larger than 350ml, it is still not as large as 1L, which is more suitable for nighttime use.\n- C. 1L: This is a common size for nighttime catheter bags, as it provides enough capacity to last through the night without needing to be emptied frequently.\n- D. 2L: This is a larger size than 1L and would be suitable for patients who need to use the catheter for an extended period, but it is not as common as 1L for nighttime use.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate size for a catheter bag used at night is 1L.",
