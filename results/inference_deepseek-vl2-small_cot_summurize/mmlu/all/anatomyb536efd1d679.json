The middle meatus is a cavity in the ethmoid bone that serves as a passageway for the olfactory nerves and the maxillary nerve.\n\n2. **Frontal Sinuses**: These are located in the frontal bone and open into the middle meatus. The frontal sinuses are the largest of the paranasal sinuses and are connected to the middle meatus via the ethmoidal cells.\n\n3. **Maxillary Sinuses**: These are located in the maxilla and open into the middle meatus. The maxillary sinuses are the largest of the paranasal sinuses and are connected to the middle meatus via the ethmoidal cells.\n\n4. **Sphenoidal Sinuses**: These are located in the sphenoid bone and open into the middle meatus. The sphenoidal sinuses are located deep within the skull and are connected to the middle meatus via the ethmoidal cells.\n\nGiven this information, the correct answer is:\n\nD. The anterior ethmoidal, frontal, maxillary, and sphenoidal sinuses\n\nEach of these sinuses opens into the middle meatus, which is a key anatomical feature in the ethmoid bone.",
