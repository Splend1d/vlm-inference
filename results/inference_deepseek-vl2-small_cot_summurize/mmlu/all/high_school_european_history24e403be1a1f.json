All the powers of old Europe have entered into a holy alliance to exorcise this specter; Pope and Czar, Metternich and Guizot, French radicals and German police spies.\nTwo things result from this fact.\nI. Communism is already acknowledged by all European powers to be in itself a power.\nII. It is high time that Communists should openly, in the face of the whole world, publish their views, their aims, their tendencies, and meet this nursery tale of the Specter of Communism with a Manifesto of the party itself.\"\nKarl Marx and Friedrich Engels, The Communist Manifesto, 1848\nBy 1917, which idea in this pamphlet had become a reality in Russia?\n\nA.

The avoidance of entangling foreign alliances - This is not mentioned in the Communist Manifesto. The manifesto talks about a holy alliance to exorcise the specter of Communism, but it doesn't say anything about avoiding foreign alliances.\n\nB. The violent overthrow of the bourgeois by the proletariat - This is mentioned in the Communist Manifesto. The manifesto says that the proletariat should openly publish their views and aims, and meet the specter of Communism with a Manifesto of the party itself. This is a call for a violent overthrow of the bourgeoisie by the proletariat.\n\nC. The establishment of a powerful Russian Parliament - This is not mentioned in the Communist Manifesto. The manifesto talks about a holy alliance to exorcise the specter of Communism, but it doesn't say anything about establishing a powerful Russian Parliament.\n\nD. The adoption of free education for all children in public schools - This is not mentioned in the Communist Manifesto. The manifesto talks about the proletariat publishing their views and aims, but it doesn't say anything about adopting free education for all children in public schools.\n\nSo, the idea that became a reality in Russia by 1917 is B. The violent overthrow of the bourgeois by the proletariat.\n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{B}$.",
