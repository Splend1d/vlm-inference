            "content": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **continue in its present orbit.**\n   - If the Sun collapsed into a black hole, the gravitational forces would change dramatically. The Sun's gravitational pull on Earth would be much stronger, potentially altering Earth's orbit. Therefore, it is unlikely that Earth would continue in its present orbit.\n\nB. **likely be sucked into the black hole.**\n   - The Sun's mass is much larger than Earth's, and the gravitational pull of a black hole is extremely strong. If the Sun collapsed into a black hole, Earth would likely be pulled into it due to the immense gravitational force.\n\nC. **be pulled apart by tidal forces.**\n   - Tidal forces are caused by the gravitational difference between two objects. While the gravitational pull of a black hole would be strong, the tidal forces would not be strong enough to pull Earth apart. The primary effect would be the gravitational pull, not the tidal forces.\n\nD. **Both C and D.**\n   - As explained, the tidal forces would not be strong enough to pull Earth apart, so this option is incorrect.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nB. likely be sucked into the black hole.",
