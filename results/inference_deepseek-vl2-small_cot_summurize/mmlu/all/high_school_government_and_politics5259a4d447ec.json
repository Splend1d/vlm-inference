            "content": "To determine the correct effect of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, we need to consider the primary goals and provisions of the legislation. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was enacted to combat racial discrimination in voting. It aimed to ensure that all eligible citizens, regardless of race, could exercise their right to vote without facing discrimination.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. States have been prohibited from establishing voter identification requirements.\n- This statement is incorrect. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 did not prohibit voter identification requirements. Instead, it aimed to ensure that any voter identification requirement did not disproportionately burden minority voters.\n\nB. Voters must now pass literacy tests before voting.\n- This statement is incorrect. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 specifically prohibited literacy tests as a method of voter discrimination. It aimed to eliminate any barriers that could prevent minority voters from exercising their right to vote.\n\nC. Voting participation for racial minority voters has increased.\n- This statement is correct. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 played a crucial role in increasing voting participation among racial minority voters. By prohibiting discriminatory practices and ensuring equal access to voting, the Act helped to empower minority communities and increase their political representation.\n\nD. The voting age was lowered from 21 to 18.\n- This statement is incorrect. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 did not affect the voting age. The voting age was lowered to 18 in 1971, but this change was unrelated to the Voting Rights Act.\n\nAfter evaluating each option, the correct answer is C. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 has had the effect of increasing voting participation for racial minority voters.",
