            "content": "To determine whether the dissolution of potassium perchlorate in water is spontaneous, we need to consider the thermodynamic principles of spontaneity, which are primarily governed by the Gibbs free energy change (\u0394G).\n\n1. **Understanding Spontaneity**: A process is spontaneous if it occurs without external energy input. In thermodynamics, this is often associated with a negative change in Gibbs free energy (\u0394G < 0).\n\n2. **Entropy Consideration**: The change in entropy (\u0394S) is a crucial factor in determining spontaneity. A process is spontaneous if the change in entropy is positive (\u0394S > 0).\n\n3. **Exothermic vs. Endothermic**: \n   - An exothermic process releases heat to the surroundings, resulting in a negative \u0394G.\n   - An endothermic process absorbs heat from the surroundings, resulting in a positive \u0394G.\n\n4. **Analyzing the Given Information**: The problem states that the temperature of the resultant solution is lower than the initial temperature of the components. This indicates that the solution is cooler than the reactants, suggesting that heat is being released.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since the dissolution of potassium perchlorate is exothermic (it releases heat), the process is spontaneous. The release of heat results in a negative \u0394G, making the process spontaneous.\n\nTherefore, the correct conclusion is:\n\nD. This is a spontaneous process because it is exothermic.",
