Health care staff are trained to accurately assess pain levels, and self-report is a reliable method for obtaining this information.\n\nB. \"can underestimate the intensity of the patient's pain.\" This statement is also incorrect. Self-report is a validated method for assessing pain intensity, and health care staff are trained to accurately interpret these reports.\n\nC. \"do not possess an objective way of assessing pain.\" This statement is incorrect. Health care staff have various tools and techniques to assess pain objectively, such as using pain scales and observing patient behavior.\n\nD. \"can use the information to prescribe and administer the least possible amount of pain relief.\" This statement is correct. By accurately assessing the patient's self-reported pain, health care staff can tailor the pain management plan to the individual's needs, ensuring that the patient receives the appropriate amount of pain relief.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Health care staff can use the information to prescribe and administer the least possible amount of pain relief.",
