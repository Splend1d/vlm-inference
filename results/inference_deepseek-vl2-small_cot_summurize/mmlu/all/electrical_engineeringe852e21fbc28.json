            "content": "The advantages of higher transmission voltage in power transmission include:\n\nA. Power transfer capability of the transmission line is increased. Higher voltage allows for more power to be transmitted over the same distance, which is beneficial for long-distance power transmission.\n\nB. Transmission line losses are reduced. Higher voltage reduces the current for a given power level, which in turn reduces the power losses due to resistance in the transmission line.\n\nC. Area of cross section and volume of the conductor is reduced. Higher voltage allows for a smaller cross-sectional area and volume of conductor to be used, which can lead to cost savings and reduced material usage.\n\nD. All of the above. Higher transmission voltage provides all the advantages listed above, making it a more efficient and cost-effective option for power transmission.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. All of the above.",
