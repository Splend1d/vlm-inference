It does not handle authentication or session management.\n\nB. **Data-link Layer**: This layer is responsible for error-free transfer of data frames between two nodes. It does not manage sessions or authentication.\n\nC. **Session Layer**: This layer establishes, manages, and terminates connections (sessions) between applications. It is responsible for session management, including authentication and session termination.\n\nD. **Presentation Layer**: This layer is responsible for data representation and encryption. It does not handle session management or authentication.\n\nBrute-force attacks on access credentials typically occur when an attacker attempts to guess passwords or other authentication credentials. This process involves multiple attempts to access a system, often using automated tools. The session layer is where these sessions are managed, including the authentication process. If a session is failed, it can indicate an attempt to brute-force the authentication, as the session layer is responsible for managing and terminating these sessions.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC.
