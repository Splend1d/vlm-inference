Since there are three components, the total number of possible color combinations is:\n\\[ 256 \\times 256 \\times 256 = 256^3 = 16,777,216 \\]\n\nSince each bit can represent one of two values (0 or 1), the number of bits needed to represent each color component is:\n\\[ \\log_2(256) = 8 \\]\n\nSince there are three components, the total number of bits needed to represent a color in the RGB model is:\n\\[ 8 \\times 3 = 24 \\]\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\\[ 24 \\]",
