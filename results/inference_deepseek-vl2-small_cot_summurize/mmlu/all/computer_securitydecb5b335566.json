Performing the tests from an undisclosed location: While being stealthy can involve using a location that is not easily traceable, this option focuses on the location rather than the overall approach to the test.\n\nB. Using encryption during tests to make the source of attacks impossible to determine: Encryption is a crucial part of maintaining security, but it is not the primary aspect of being stealthy in a penetration test. The goal is to remain undetected, not to encrypt data.\n\nC. Performing penetration testing without the target organization knowing: This option is about the outcome of the test, not the approach. Being stealthy is about how the test is conducted, not whether the target is aware.\n\nD. Taking care to avoid activities during a penetration test that might attract attention, e.g., by operators or IDS services: This option directly addresses the concept of stealth. Being stealthy during a penetration test involves carefully planning and executing the test to avoid detection by the target's security measures, such as operators or Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Taking care to avoid activities during a penetration test that might attract attention, e.g., by operators or IDS services. This approach ensures that the test remains undetected, maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of the test environment.",
