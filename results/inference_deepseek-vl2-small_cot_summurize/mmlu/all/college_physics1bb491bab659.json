            "content": "To determine the most strongly reflected wavelength, we need to consider the interference of light waves reflected from the two surfaces of the oil layer.\n\n1. **Understanding Reflection and Refraction**:\n   - When light hits a surface, it can be reflected or refracted. The angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection.\n   - The index of refraction indicates how much the speed of light changes as it passes through a medium.\n\n2. **Reflection from the Oil Layer**:\n   - The oil layer has an index of refraction of 1.5.\n   - The light first reflects off the top surface of the oil layer.\n   - The angle of incidence at the top surface is the same as the angle of reflection.\n\n3. **Reflection from the Water Surface**:\n   - The water has an index of refraction of 1.33.\n   - The light then reflects off the bottom surface of the oil layer.\n   - The angle of incidence at the bottom surface is the same as the angle of reflection.\n\n4. **Interference and Reflection**:\n   - The light waves reflected from the top and bottom surfaces of the oil layer interfere with each other.\n   - The interference pattern depends on the difference in the path lengths of the two waves.\n\n5. **Calculating the Path Difference**:\n   - The path difference is the difference in the distances traveled by the light waves.\n   - For the top surface, the path difference is \\(2 \\times \\text{thickness of oil} \\times \\text{index of refraction of oil}\\).\n   - For the bottom surface, the path difference is \\(2 \\times \\text{thickness of oil} \\times \\text{index of refraction of oil}\\).\n\n6. **Determining the Wavelength**:\n   - The path difference is equal to an integer multiple of the wavelength.\n   - The most strongly reflected wavelength is the one where the path difference is an integer multiple of the wavelength.\n\n7. **Calculating the Wavelength**:\n   - The thickness of the oil layer is 500 nm.\n   - The index of refraction of oil is 1.5.\n   - The path difference is \\(2 \\times 500 \\times 1.5 = 1500\\) nm.\n   - The most strongly reflected wavelength is the smallest wavelength that satisfies the path difference condition.\n\n8. **Conclusion**:\n   - The most strongly reflected wavelength is the one that corresponds to the smallest wavelength satisfying the path difference condition.\n   - The correct answer is 500 nm.\n\nTherefore, the most strongly reflected wavelength is **A. 500 nm**.",
