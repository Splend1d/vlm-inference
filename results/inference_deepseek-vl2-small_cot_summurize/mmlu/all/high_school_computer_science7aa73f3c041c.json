This means that the number should be divisible by 2 with a remainder of 1.\n\nOption A: (num MOD 1) = 0\nThis condition is not relevant to determining if a number is odd or even.\n\nOption B: (num MOD 1) = 1\nThis condition is not relevant to determining if a number is odd or even.\n\nOption C: (num MOD 2) = 0\nThis condition is not relevant to determining if a number is odd or even.\n\nOption D: (num MOD 2) = 1\nThis condition is relevant to determining if a number is odd or even. If the remainder of dividing a number by 2 is 1, then the number is odd.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. (num MOD 2) = 1.",
