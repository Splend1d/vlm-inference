There is insufficient information given in the question to draw a conclusion about market efficiency.\n\nThe information provided only tells us that 3 out of 100 fund managers significantly \"beat the market\" using a Jensen-type regression. However, this does not provide enough evidence to conclude that the entire stock market is inefficient. Market inefficiency is a broader concept that involves various factors, including the presence of arbitrage opportunities, the behavior of investors, and the overall performance of the market.\n\nTo determine market inefficiency, one would need to conduct a more comprehensive analysis that includes factors such as the presence of arbitrage opportunities, the behavior of investors, and the overall performance of the market. This would involve testing a larger sample of fund managers, analyzing the returns of the market as a whole, and examining the behavior of investors in the market.\n\nIn summary, the information provided in the question is not sufficient to draw a conclusion about market efficiency.",
