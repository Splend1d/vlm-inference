            "content": "To determine which aspect of national elections voters who rely exclusively on television network news coverage are most likely to be aware of, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Which special interest groups have endorsed which candidates**: This option is less likely because television network news often focuses on the candidates themselves rather than the endorsements from special interest groups. These endorsements might be covered, but they are not typically the primary focus of network news coverage.\n\nB. **The relative strength of each candidate's support, as indicated by public opinion polls**: While public opinion polls are a significant source of information, television network news often presents this information in a way that is more digestible for the general audience. However, the polls themselves are not the primary focus of network news coverage.\n\nC. **Candidates' positions on international issues**: International issues are often covered by network news, but they are not the main focus. The coverage tends to be more about the candidates' domestic policies and how they plan to address domestic issues.\n\nD. **Candidates' positions on domestic issues**: This is the most likely option. Network news often emphasizes the candidates' domestic policies and how they plan to address issues such as healthcare, education, and the economy. These are the issues that directly affect the daily lives of voters and are typically the primary focus of network news coverage.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Candidates' positions on domestic issues.",
