            "content": "To determine the effects on the equilibrium price and quantity, we need to analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Expectation of Lower Future Price**: Consumers expect the price of corn to decrease in the future. This expectation can lead to a decrease in current demand for corn, as consumers may choose to buy less now and wait for the price to drop.\n\n2. **Fall in Price of Seed Corn and Fertilizer**: The reduction in the cost of seed corn and fertilizer can make it cheaper for farmers to produce corn. This cost reduction can lead to an increase in supply, as farmers are more willing to produce more corn at a lower cost.\n\nNow, let's analyze the effects on the equilibrium:\n\n- **Equilibrium Price**:\n  - With a decrease in demand due to the expectation of lower future prices, the current demand curve shifts to the left.\n  - Simultaneously, the supply curve shifts to the right due to the reduced costs of production.\n  - The intersection of these two curves determines the new equilibrium price.\n  - Since the demand curve shifts left and the supply curve shifts right, the equilibrium price is likely to fall.\n\n- **Equilibrium Quantity**:\n  - The change in equilibrium price affects the quantity demanded and supplied.\n  - A lower equilibrium price typically leads to an increase in equilibrium quantity, as the lower price makes corn more attractive to consumers and more profitable for producers.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. The equilibrium price will fall while the equilibrium quantity is indeterminate.\n\nThe equilibrium quantity is indeterminate because it depends on the relative magnitudes of the shifts in demand and supply. If the demand shift is larger than the supply shift, the equilibrium quantity will increase; if the supply shift is larger, the equilibrium quantity will decrease.",
