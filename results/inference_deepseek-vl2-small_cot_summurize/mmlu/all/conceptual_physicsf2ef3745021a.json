            "content": "To understand the behavior of light during interference, we need to consider the principles of wave interference. When two or more waves meet, they can either add together (constructive interference) or cancel each other out (destructive interference).\n\n1. **Constructive Interference**: This occurs when the crest of one wave aligns with the crest of another wave, or the trough of one wave aligns with the trough of another wave. In this case, the amplitudes of the waves add together, resulting in a wave with a larger amplitude. This is why light can build up to more than the sum of its individual amplitudes.\n\n2. **Destructive Interference**: This happens when the crest of one wave aligns with the trough of another wave, or vice versa. In this situation, the amplitudes of the waves cancel each other out, resulting in a wave with an amplitude of zero. This is why light can cancel completely.\n\nGiven these principles, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Both of these\n\nThis means that during interference, light can either build up to more than the sum of its amplitudes (constructive interference) or cancel completely (destructive interference).",
