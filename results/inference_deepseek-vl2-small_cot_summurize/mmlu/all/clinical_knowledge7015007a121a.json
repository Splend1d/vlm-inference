            "content": "To determine the correct ratio for delivering chest compressions and ventilations during CPR, we need to understand the guidelines provided by the American Heart Association (AHA).\n\n1. **Understanding the Ratio**: The AHA recommends a chest compression to ventilation ratio of 30:2. This means for every 30 compressions, you should deliver 2 breaths.\n\n2. **Purpose of the Ratio**: The ratio is designed to ensure that the heart receives adequate blood flow while also allowing the lungs to receive enough oxygenated air. This balance is crucial for maintaining effective circulation and oxygenation during CPR.\n\n3. **Why the Ratio Matters**: \n   - **Compressions**: These help circulate blood to the brain and other vital organs.\n   - **Ventilations**: These ensure that the lungs are oxygenating the blood.\n\n4. **Evaluating the Options**:\n   - **Option A (2:25)**: This ratio is incorrect because it does not align with the recommended 30:2 ratio.\n   - **Option B (15:02)**: This ratio is also incorrect as it does not match the recommended 30:2 ratio.\n   - **Option C (1:05)**: This ratio is incorrect as it does not correspond to the recommended 30:2 ratio.\n   - **Option D (30:02:00)**: This option is correct as it matches the recommended 30:2 ratio.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **D. 30:02:00**. This ratio ensures that the heart receives the necessary blood flow while allowing the lungs to receive adequate oxygenation during CPR.",
