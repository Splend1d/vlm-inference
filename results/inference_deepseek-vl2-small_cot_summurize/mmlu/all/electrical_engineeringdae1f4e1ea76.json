This is because the Ward-Leonard system is a type of DC motor that uses a permanent magnet and a field winding to produce a magnetic field. The residual magnetism of the generator is the magnetic field that remains in the generator even when the armature is not rotating. This residual magnetism creates a back electromotive force (EMF) that opposes the rotation of the armature, limiting the speed of the motor. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Residual magnetism of the generator.",
