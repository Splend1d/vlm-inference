            "content": "To determine the correct phase during which crossing-over occurs, we need to understand the process of meiosis and the role of crossing-over.\n\nMeiosis is a type of cell division that reduces the chromosome number by half, resulting in the production of gametes. It consists of two main stages: meiosis I and meiosis II. Each stage is further divided into several phases.\n\n1. **Prophase I**: This is the first stage of meiosis I. During this phase, homologous chromosomes pair up in a process called synapsis. Crossing-over, which involves the exchange of genetic material between homologous chromosomes, occurs during this phase. The crossing-over is facilitated by the enzyme called recombinase, which creates new combinations of alleles on the homologous chromosomes.\n\n2. **Metaphase I**: In this phase, homologous chromosomes are aligned at the metaphase plate. Crossing-over has already occurred, and the homologous chromosomes are paired.\n\n3. **Anaphase I**: This phase involves the separation of homologous chromosomes. Crossing-over has already been completed, and the chromosomes are being pulled apart.\n\n4. **Prophase II**: This is the first stage of meiosis II. It involves the separation of sister chromatids, not crossing-over.\n\n5. **Metaphase II**: This phase involves the alignment of sister chromatids at the metaphase plate.\n\n6. **Anaphase II**: This phase involves the separation of sister chromatids.\n\n7. **Telophase II and Cytokinesis**: These final stages involve the completion of cell division, resulting in the formation of four haploid cells.\n\nGiven this analysis, crossing-over specifically occurs during **Prophase I** of meiosis. This is the phase where homologous chromosomes pair up and exchange genetic material, leading to genetic diversity.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Prophase I",
