            "content": "To determine which type of selection results in brightly colored peacocks mating more frequently than drab ones, we need to understand the concept of sexual selection. Sexual selection is a type of natural selection that favors traits that enhance an individual's ability to attract mates. Brightly colored peacocks are more likely to attract mates due to their vibrant plumage, which is a result of sexual selection.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Artificial selection: This refers to the process of humans selectively breeding organisms for desired traits. It does not apply to natural selection processes occurring in the wild.\n\nB. Directional selection: This type of selection favors one extreme of a trait over others, often leading to a shift in the population's phenotype. It does not specifically address the mating behavior of peacocks.\n\nC. Stabilizing selection: This type of selection favors the average phenotype and reduces the frequency of extreme traits. It does not explain why brightly colored peacocks would be more successful in mating.\n\nD. Sexual selection: This is the correct answer. Sexual selection is the process by which certain traits become more common in a population because they enhance an individual's ability to attract mates. Brightly colored peacocks are more likely to be chosen by mates due to their striking appearance, leading to a higher frequency of mating.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Sexual selection.",
