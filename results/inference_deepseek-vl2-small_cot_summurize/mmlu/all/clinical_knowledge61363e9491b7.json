Physical and pharmacological needs only: This option is incomplete because it neglects the psychological needs of the person. Pain management is not just about addressing physical symptoms but also involves addressing emotional and psychological aspects.\n\nB. Physical and psychological needs only: This option is also incomplete because it overlooks pharmacological needs. While psychological support is crucial, pharmacological interventions are often necessary to effectively manage pain.\n\nC. Physical, psychological, and pharmacological needs followed by regular reassessment: This option is comprehensive and addresses all aspects of pain management. It emphasizes the importance of addressing physical symptoms, psychological support, and pharmacological interventions. Additionally, regular reassessment ensures that the care plan remains effective and adaptable to the person's changing needs.\n\nD. None of the above, as the main priority is to limit drug side effects: This option is incorrect because it does not consider the importance of addressing physical and psychological needs. Limiting drug side effects is important, but it should not be the only focus.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is C. Physical, psychological, and pharmacological needs followed by regular reassessment. This approach ensures a holistic and effective management of pain.",
