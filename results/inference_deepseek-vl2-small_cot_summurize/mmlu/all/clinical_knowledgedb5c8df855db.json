            "content": "To determine which statement is not true, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Muscle glycogen is broken down enzymatically to glucose-1-phosphate\n- This statement is true. Muscle glycogen is broken down into glucose-1-phosphate by the enzyme glycogen phosphorylase. This process is crucial for maintaining blood glucose levels during periods of low carbohydrate intake.\n\nB. Elite endurance runners have a high proportion of Type I fibres in their leg muscles\n- This statement is true. Elite endurance runners typically have a higher proportion of Type I muscle fibers, which are slow-twitch fibers that are more efficient at using oxygen and are less prone to fatigue.\n\nC. Liver glycogen is important in the maintenance of the blood glucose concentration\n- This statement is true. Liver glycogen plays a critical role in maintaining blood glucose levels, especially during fasting or intense exercise when blood glucose levels drop.\n\nD. Insulin promotes glucose uptake by all tissues in the body\n- This statement is not true. Insulin promotes glucose uptake by most tissues, but it does not promote glucose uptake by all tissues. For example, insulin does not promote glucose uptake by the brain, which relies on alternative energy sources during periods of low blood glucose.\n\nTherefore, the statement that is not true is D. Insulin promotes glucose uptake by all tissues in the body.",
