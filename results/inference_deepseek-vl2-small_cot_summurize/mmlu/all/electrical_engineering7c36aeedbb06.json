This current is typically much higher than the holding current, which is the current required to keep the thyristor in the off state.\n\nGiven that the latching current of the SCR is 20 mA, the holding current will be significantly lower. The holding current is typically in the range of 10 mA to 20 mA for most SCRs, but it can vary depending on the specific model and manufacturer.\n\nTherefore, the holding current of the SCR is likely to be around 10 mA.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 10 mA.",
