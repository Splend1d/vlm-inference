            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total electric displacement normal to the surface of the cube. The electric displacement is given by the surface charge density times the area of the surface.\n\nGiven:\n- Surface charge density (\u03c3) = 20 coulombs/m\u00b2\n- Radius of the metal surface = 1 meter\n- Side length of the cube = 10 meters\n\nFirst, we need to find the area of the metal surface. The metal surface is a circle with a radius of 1 meter. The area of a circle is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ A = \\pi r^2 \\]\n\nwhere \\( r \\) is the radius of the circle.\n\n\\[ A = \\pi (1)^2 = \\pi \\]\n\nSo, the area of the metal surface is \\( \\pi \\) square meters.\n\nNext, we need to find the total electric displacement normal to the surface of the cube. The electric displacement is given by the surface charge density times the area of the surface.\n\n\\[ D = \\sigma \\times A \\]\n\n\\[ D = 20 \\times \\pi \\]\n\n\\[ D = 20\\pi \\]\n\nTherefore, the total outward electric displacement normal to the surface of the cube is \\( 20\\pi \\) coulombs.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nB. 80\u03c0 coulombs.",
