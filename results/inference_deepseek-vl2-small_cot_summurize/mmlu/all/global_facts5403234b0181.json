            "content": "To determine the percentage of the world's land area that is forested as of 2015, we need to consider the global distribution of forests and the data available from reliable sources.\n\n1. **Understanding Forest Distribution**: Forests cover a significant portion of the Earth's land area. They are primarily found in tropical regions, temperate zones, and boreal (taiga) regions.\n\n2. **Global Forest Data**: According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, as of 2015, about 31% of the world's land area was covered by forests. This includes both natural forests and those managed for timber, fuelwood, and other forest products.\n\n3. **Evaluating the Options**:\n   - **Option A (15%)**: This is too low, as it does not reflect the substantial coverage of forests globally.\n   - **Option B (30%)**: This is also too low, as it underestimates the actual forested area.\n   - **Option C (45%)**: This is closer but still not the correct percentage.\n   - **Option D (60%)**: This is significantly higher than the actual percentage, indicating an overestimation.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The correct percentage of the world's land area that is forested as of 2015 is approximately 31%.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. 30%**.",
