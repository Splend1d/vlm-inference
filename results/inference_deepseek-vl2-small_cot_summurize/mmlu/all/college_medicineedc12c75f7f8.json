            "content": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Triplet sequences of nucleotide bases in mRNA or DNA**: This option describes codons. Codons are sequences of three nucleotide bases in mRNA or DNA that correspond to specific amino acids or stop signals during protein synthesis. Each codon is read by the ribosome in sets of three, allowing the genetic code to be translated into a specific sequence of amino acids.\n\nB. **Quadruplet sequences of nucleotide bases in mRNA or DNA**: This option describes codons, but it incorrectly refers to them as quadruplets. A quadruplet is a sequence of four nucleotide bases, which is not the correct term for codons.\n\nC. **Triplet sequences of amino acids in polypeptide chains**: This option describes codons, but it incorrectly refers to them as sequences of amino acids. Codons are sequences of nucleotide bases, not amino acids.\n\nD. **Triplet sequences of deoxyribose sugars in DNA**: This option is incorrect because deoxyribose sugars are not part of codons. Codons are composed of nucleotide bases, not sugars.\n\nAfter evaluating each option, the correct answer is:\n\nA. **Triplet sequences of nucleotide bases in mRNA or DNA**.",
