            "content": "To determine which statement is true about rheumatoid arthritis, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Rheumatoid factor is present in 25% of rheumatoid cases.\n- Rheumatoid factor (RF) is a blood test that can indicate the presence of rheumatoid arthritis. However, it is not specific to the disease and can be found in about 80% of the general population. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that RF is present in 25% of rheumatoid cases.\n\nB. It is an example of an oligoarthropathy.\n- Oligoarthropathy refers to a condition where fewer than five joints are affected. Rheumatoid arthritis typically affects multiple joints, often more than ten, making this statement incorrect.\n\nC. Anaemia is a common finding.\n- Rheumatoid arthritis can lead to anaemia due to chronic inflammation and the body's response to the disease. It is indeed a common finding in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nD. Heberden's nodes are a feature.\n- Heberden's nodes are bony lumps that form on the joints of the fingers, typically in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. This statement is true.\n\nAfter evaluating each option, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Anaemia is a common finding.\n\nThis is because anaemia is a common complication of rheumatoid arthritis due to the chronic inflammatory process and the body's response to the disease.",
