            "content": "To determine the acceleration of the object, we need to consider the forces acting on it and use Newton's second law of motion. The forces acting on the object are:\n\n1. The gravitational force acting downward, \\( F_g = mg \\), where \\( m \\) is the mass of the object and \\( g \\) is the acceleration due to gravity.\n2. The normal force acting perpendicular to the plane, \\( F_n \\).\n3. The frictional force acting parallel to the plane, \\( F_f \\).\n\nThe net force acting on the object is the difference between the gravitational force and the frictional force:\n\n\\[ F_{\\text{net}} = F_g - F_f \\]\n\nThe frictional force can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ F_f = \\mu F_n \\]\n\nwhere \\( \\mu \\) is the coefficient of friction.\n\nThe normal force can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ F_n = mg \\cos \\theta \\]\n\nwhere \\( \\theta \\) is the angle of incline.\n\nSubstituting these into the equation for the net force, we get:\n\n\\[ F_{\\text{net}} = mg - \\mu mg \\cos \\theta \\]\n\nUsing Newton's second law, \\( F = ma \\), we can write:\n\n\\[ ma = mg - \\mu mg \\cos \\theta \\]\n\nSolving for \\( a \\), we get:\n\n\\[ a = g - \\mu g \\cos \\theta \\]\n\nHowever, this is not one of the options provided. Let's re-evaluate the forces and the equation.\n\nThe correct equation for the net force is:\n\n\\[ F_{\\text{net}} = mg \\sin \\theta - \\mu mg \\cos \\theta \\]\n\nUsing Newton's second law, we can write:\n\n\\[ ma = mg \\sin \\theta - \\mu mg \\cos \\theta \\]\n\nSolving for \\( a \\), we get:\n\n\\[ a = g \\sin \\theta - \\mu g \\cos \\theta \\]\n\nThis matches option B.
