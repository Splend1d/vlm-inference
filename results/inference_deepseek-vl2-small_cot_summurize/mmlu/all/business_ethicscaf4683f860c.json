            "content": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each type of conflict of interest mentioned in the question:\n\n1. **Conflict of Professional Interests**: This occurs when a professional's personal interests conflict with their professional duties. For example, a lawyer might have a personal interest in a case that conflicts with their professional duty to represent their client impartially.\n\n2. **Conflict of Organizational Interests**: This arises when the interests of an organization conflict with those of its employees or partners. For instance, a company might have a conflict if it is required to prioritize its own financial interests over the interests of its employees.\n\n3. **Conflict of Personal Interests**: This is when an individual's personal interests conflict with their professional or organizational responsibilities. For example, an employee might have a personal interest in a competitor's business, which could conflict with their duties to their current employer.\n\n4. **Conflict of Organizational Interests**: This is similar to the previous point but refers to the interests of the organization itself. For example, a company might have a conflict if it is required to prioritize its own financial interests over the interests of its employees.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Professional, Individual, Personal, Organizational\n\nThis option correctly matches the types of conflicts of interest described in the question.",
