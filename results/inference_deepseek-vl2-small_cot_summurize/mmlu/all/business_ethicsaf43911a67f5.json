It emphasizes the role of emotions and virtues in moral decision-making, suggesting that moral behavior is driven by a sense of goodness and a desire to act well.\n\nB. **Ethical egoism**: This perspective holds that individuals should act in their own self-interest, as this is the most rational course of action. It does not emphasize morality beyond rationality or emotional impulses.\n\nC. **Postmodern ethics**: This approach challenges traditional notions of morality and truth, often questioning the idea of objective moral truths. It does not specifically focus on locating morality beyond rationality.\n\nD. **Ethics of duty**: This ethical theory emphasizes the importance of fulfilling one's duties and obligations, often without considering the emotional or rational aspects of moral behavior.\n\nGiven the context of locating morality beyond the sphere of rationality in an emotional 'moral impulse' towards others, the most appropriate answer is:\n\nA. **Virtue ethics**. This theory aligns with the idea of moral behavior being driven by a sense of goodness and a desire to act well, which can be seen as an emotional 'moral impulse'.",
