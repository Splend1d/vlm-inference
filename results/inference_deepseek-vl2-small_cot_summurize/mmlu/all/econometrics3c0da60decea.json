            "content": "To determine whether the given AR(2) process is stationary, unit root, explosive, or stationary and unit root, we need to analyze its properties.\n\nAn AR(2) process is a second-order autoregressive process with two lagged terms. The general form of an AR(2) process is:\n\nyt = \u03c61 yt-1 + \u03c62 yt-2 + ut\n\nwhere \u03c61 and \u03c62 are the autoregressive coefficients, and ut is the white noise term.\n\nA process is stationary if its mean, variance, and autocorrelation function do not change over time. A process is a unit root process if it has a unit root in its characteristic equation, which means that the roots of the characteristic equation are on the unit circle in the complex plane. An explosive process is a process with a variance that grows exponentially over time.\n\nLet's analyze the given AR(2) process:\n\nyt = 1.5 yt-1 - 0.5 yt-2 + ut\n\nThe characteristic equation of this process is:\n\n(1 - 1.5z - 0.5z^2) = 0\n\nThe roots of this characteristic equation are:\n\nz1 = 1.5\nz2 = -0.5\n\nSince both roots have a magnitude greater than 1, the process is an explosive process. This means that the variance of the process grows exponentially over time.\n\nTherefore, the given AR(2) process is an explosive process.\n\nThe correct answer is C. Explosive process.",
