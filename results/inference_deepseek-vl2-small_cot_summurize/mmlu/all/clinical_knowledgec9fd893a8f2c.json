            "content": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the structure of the human heart:\n\n1. **Chambers**: The heart has two main chambers: the left atrium and the left ventricle. These chambers are responsible for pumping oxygenated blood to the body.\n\n2. **Valves**: The heart contains four valves that ensure unidirectional blood flow:\n   - **Tricuspid Valve**: Located between the right atrium and the right ventricle.\n   - **Pulmonary Valve**: Located between the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery.\n   - **Mitral Valve (Bicuspid Valve)**: Located between the left atrium and the left ventricle.\n   - **Aortic Valve**: Located between the left ventricle and the aorta.\n\n3. **Functionality**: The heart's structure is designed to efficiently pump blood through these chambers and valves. The right side of the heart handles deoxygenated blood, while the left side handles oxygenated blood.\n\nGiven this information, the correct answer is:\n\nA. two valves and two chambers.\n\nThis option accurately describes the heart's structure, which includes two valves (the tricuspid and mitral valves) and two chambers (the right atrium and right ventricle).",
