His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe radical movement known as anarchism, alluded to in the first paragraph, had been related to all of the following EXCEPT\n\nA. the International Workingman's Association\nB.

            "content": "The radical movement referred to in the first paragraph is anarchism. Anarchism is a political philosophy that advocates for the abolition of all forms of government and the establishment of a stateless society. It is often associated with the International Workingman's Association, which was a labor organization that aimed to unite workers across national borders.\n\nPierre-Joseph Proudhon was a French philosopher and economist who is often considered the father of anarchism. He advocated for the abolition of private property and the establishment of a society based on mutual aid and cooperation.\n\nThe Paris Commune was a short-lived revolutionary government that was established in Paris in 1871 during the Franco-Prussian War. It was a radical experiment in direct democracy and was closely associated with anarchist and socialist movements.\n\nThe Congress of Vienna, on the other hand, was a series of meetings held in 1814 and 1815 that aimed to restore the balance of power in Europe after the Napoleonic Wars. It was a conservative and reactionary event that was not associated with anarchism.\n\nTherefore, the radical movement known as anarchism had been related to all of the following except the Congress of Vienna.\n\nSo, the final answer is $\\boxed{C}$.",
