The heart rate typically decreases during rest, and this range is within the expected range for a healthy adult.\n\nB. 60-100 bpm: While this range is also considered normal, it is slightly higher than the typical resting heart rate. It is possible for some individuals to have a resting heart rate within this range, but it is not as common as the 60-80 bpm range.\n\nC. 60-90 bpm: This range is also considered normal, but it is slightly lower than the typical resting heart rate. It is possible for some individuals to have a resting heart rate within this range, but it is not as common as the 60-80 bpm range.\n\nD. 60-110 bpm: This range is slightly higher than the typical resting heart rate. While it is possible for some individuals to have a resting heart rate within this range, it is not as common as the 60-80 bpm range.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most common and typical resting heart rate for an adult is within the range of 60-80 bpm. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 60-80 bpm.",
