Peak flow readings are often used to monitor the severity of asthma attacks. A variation in peak flow readings over a two-week period can indicate changes in asthma symptoms, such as worsening or improvement, which is diagnostic for asthma.\n\nB. **COPD**: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema. While peak flow readings can be used to assess COPD severity, the variation over a two-week period is more commonly associated with asthma rather than COPD, which is typically more stable.\n\nC. **Pneumonia**: Pneumonia is an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs. While peak flow readings can be used to monitor the severity of pneumonia, the variation over a two-week period is more indicative of asthma symptoms rather than pneumonia.\n\nD. **Tuberculosis**: Tuberculosis is a bacterial infection that primarily affects the lungs. While peak flow readings can be used to monitor the progression of tuberculosis, the variation over a two-week period is more commonly associated with asthma rather than tuberculosis.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the variation in serial peak flow readings over a two-week period is most diagnostic for asthma. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Asthma.",
