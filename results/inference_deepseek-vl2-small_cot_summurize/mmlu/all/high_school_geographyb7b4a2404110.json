This could include economic, social, or cultural functions.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Dixie**: This term is often used to refer to the Southern United States, particularly in a cultural or historical context. It is not a functional region because it does not represent a specific economic or social function.\n\nB. **Pennsylvania**: This is a state in the United States.
