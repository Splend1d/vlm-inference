Genetic variation exists within populations.\n- This is a fundamental concept in natural selection. Genetic variation is the raw material from which natural selection acts. Without variation, there would be no differences in traits to be selected for or against.\n\nB. The best-adapted individuals tend to leave the most offspring.\n- This is a core principle of natural selection. Individuals with traits that are better suited to their environment are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing on their advantageous traits to the next generation.\n\nC. Individuals who survive longer tend to leave more offspring than those who die young.\n- This statement is not a basis for natural selection. While it might seem intuitive, it is not a direct mechanism of natural selection. Natural selection is about the differential survival and reproduction of individuals with different traits, not about the number of offspring.\n\nD. Individuals adapt to their environments and, thereby, evolve.\n- This is a key outcome of natural selection. As individuals with advantageous traits survive and reproduce, the population as a whole adapts to its environment, leading to evolution.\n\nBased on this analysis, the statement that is not a basis for natural selection is:\n\nC. Individuals who survive longer tend to leave more offspring than those who die young.",
