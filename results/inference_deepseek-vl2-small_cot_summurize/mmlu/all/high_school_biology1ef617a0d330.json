An example is barnacles attaching to a whale, benefiting from the whale's movement through the water, while the whale is unaffected.\n\nB. **Succession**: This refers to the process of one species replacing another in an ecosystem over time. It is a biological process rather than an interaction between species.\n\nC. **Mutualism**: This is a type of interspecies interaction where both species benefit. An example is bees and flowers, where bees get nectar and flowers get pollinated.\n\nD. **Parasitism**: This is a type of interspecies interaction where one species (the parasite) benefits at the expense of the other (the host). An example is a tapeworm living in the intestines of a host.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is B. **Succession** is not a form of interspecies interaction. It is a process that describes the change in species composition in an ecosystem over time.",
