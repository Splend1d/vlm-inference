            "content": "To determine which ionic substance has the greatest lattice enthalpy, we need to consider the charges of the ions involved and the size of the ions. Lattice enthalpy is the energy required to separate one mole of an ionic solid into its gaseous ions. It is influenced by the charge of the ions and the distance between them.\n\n1. **MgO (Magnesium Oxide)**:\n   - Magnesium (Mg) has a +2 charge.\n   - Oxygen (O) has a -2 charge.\n   - The charge difference is 4, which is relatively high.\n   - The ionic radius of Mg is smaller than that of O, leading to a stronger electrostatic attraction.\n\n2. **MgS (Magnesium Sulfide)**:\n   - Magnesium (Mg) has a +2 charge.\n   - Sulfur (S) has a -2 charge.\n   - The charge difference is 4, similar to MgO.\n   - The ionic radius of Mg is smaller than that of S, leading to a strong attraction.\n\n3. **NaF (Sodium Fluoride)**:\n   - Sodium (Na) has a +1 charge.\n   - Fluorine (F) has a -1 charge.\n   - The charge difference is 2, which is lower than in MgO and MgS.\n   - The ionic radius of Na is larger than that of F, leading to a weaker attraction.\n\n4. **NaCl (Sodium Chloride)**:\n   - Sodium (Na) has a +1 charge.\n   - Chlorine (Cl) has a -1 charge.\n   - The charge difference is 2, similar to NaF.\n   - The ionic radius of Na is larger than that of Cl, leading to a weaker attraction.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- The lattice enthalpy is directly proportional to the charge of the ions and inversely proportional to the size of the ions.\n- MgO and MgS have the highest charge difference (4) and the smallest ionic radius difference, leading to the strongest electrostatic attraction and thus the greatest lattice enthalpy.\n- NaF and NaCl have a lower charge difference (2) and a larger ionic radius difference, leading to weaker attractions and lower lattice enthalpies.\n\nTherefore, the ionic substance with the greatest lattice enthalpy is **MgO**.",
