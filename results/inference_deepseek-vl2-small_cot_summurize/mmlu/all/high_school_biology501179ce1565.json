They also have DNA, which is located in the nucleoid region in bacteria and within a nucleus in fungi. The plasma membrane is present in both organisms, serving as a barrier to protect the cell's interior. Therefore, this option is correct.\n\nB. **Nucleus, organelles, and unicellularity**: Bacteria are typically unicellular and do not have a nucleus. They have a nucleoid region where their DNA is located. In contrast, fungi are eukaryotic, meaning they have a nucleus and organelles. Thus, this option is incorrect.\n\nC. **Plasma membrane, multicellularity, and Golgi apparatus**: While both bacteria and fungi have a plasma membrane, bacteria are generally unicellular, and fungi can be unicellular or multicellular. Additionally, the Golgi apparatus is a feature of eukaryotic cells, including fungi, but not typically found in bacteria. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\nD. **Cell wall, unicellularity, and mitochondria**: Bacteria have a cell wall and are unicellular, but they do not have mitochondria, which are present in eukaryotic cells like fungi. Thus, this option is incorrect.\n\nAfter evaluating each option, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Cell wall, DNA, and plasma membrane.",
