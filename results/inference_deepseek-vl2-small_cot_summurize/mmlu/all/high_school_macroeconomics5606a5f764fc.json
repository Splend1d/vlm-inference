            "content": "To determine the best example of a negative supply shock to the economy, we need to understand what a supply shock is. A supply shock refers to a sudden and significant change in the cost of inputs or resources that affects the production process. This can lead to a decrease in the overall supply of goods and services in the economy, which can have various effects on the economy, including inflation, reduced output, and changes in employment.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. A decrease in government spending: This is more of a demand shock because it directly affects the demand side of the economy. A decrease in government spending reduces aggregate demand, which can lead to lower economic output and potentially higher unemployment.\n\nB. A decrease in the real interest rate: This is also a demand shock. A decrease in the real interest rate makes borrowing cheaper, which can increase consumption and investment, thus boosting aggregate demand.\n\nC. An increase in the money supply: This is a monetary policy action that can affect both the demand and supply sides of the economy. An increase in the money supply can lower interest rates, increase consumption and investment, and potentially boost aggregate demand.\n\nD. Unexpectedly higher resource prices: This is a negative supply shock. When resource prices, such as oil or raw materials, unexpectedly rise, it increases the cost of production for businesses. This can lead to a decrease in the supply of goods and services, as businesses may reduce production or pass on the higher costs to consumers in the form of higher prices. This can result in inflation, reduced output, and potentially higher unemployment.\n\nBased on this analysis, the best example of a negative supply shock to the economy is:\n\nD. Unexpectedly higher resource prices.",
