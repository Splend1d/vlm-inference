All of the above\n\nA Colpitts oscillator is a type of electronic oscillator circuit that uses a combination of capacitors and inductors to create a resonant circuit. It is also known as a tank circuit oscillator because it uses a tank circuit, which is a resonant circuit consisting of a capacitor and an inductor. Additionally, it is sometimes referred to as an LC oscillator because it uses both capacitors and inductors in its design.",
