            "content": "To determine what happens to light that is not transmitted by opaque materials, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Reflected or converted to internal energy in the material.**\n   - When light encounters an opaque material, it cannot pass through. Instead, it can either be reflected back into the original medium or absorbed by the material. The energy from the light is converted into internal energy, which can increase the temperature of the material. This is a common occurrence with materials like metals or glass.\n\nB. **Mainly reflected.**\n   - While some light is reflected, the majority of the light that is not transmitted is absorbed by the material. Therefore, this option is not entirely accurate.\n\nC. **Mainly refracted.**\n   - Refraction occurs when light passes from one medium to another with a different refractive index. Since the light is not passing through the material, it is not refracted.\n\nD. **Transmitted at a lower frequency.**\n   - The frequency of light remains constant regardless of whether it is transmitted or not. The frequency does not change when light is absorbed or reflected.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Reflected or converted to internal energy in the material.",
