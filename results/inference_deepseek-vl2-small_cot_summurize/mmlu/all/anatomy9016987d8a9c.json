            "content": "To determine where proprioceptive nerve endings are located in synovial joints, we need to understand the anatomy and function of these joints.\n\n1. **Synovial Joint Anatomy**: Synovial joints are the most common type of joint in the human body. They are characterized by a joint cavity filled with synovial fluid, which lubricates the joint and reduces friction. The joint capsule is a fibrous structure that surrounds the joint, providing stability and support.\n\n2. **Proprioceptive Nerve Endings**: Proprioception refers to the body's ability to sense its position and movement. Proprioceptive nerve endings are sensory receptors that detect changes in joint position and movement.\n\n3. **Location of Proprioceptive Nerve Endings**: In synovial joints, proprioceptive nerve endings are primarily located in the synovial membrane and the capsule. The synovial membrane lines the inside of the joint capsule and is rich in sensory nerve endings. These endings are responsible for transmitting proprioceptive information to the central nervous system.\n\n4. **Analysis of Options**:\n   - **Option A**: Articular cartilage and synovial membrane. While the synovial membrane contains proprioceptive nerve endings, articular cartilage itself does not.\n   - **Option B**: Synovial membrane and capsule. This is the correct answer, as both the synovial membrane and the capsule contain proprioceptive nerve endings.\n   - **Option C**: Capsule and ligaments. While the capsule contains proprioceptive nerve endings, ligaments do not.\n   - **Option D**: Ligaments and articular discs. Both ligaments and articular discs do not contain proprioceptive nerve endings.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. synovial membrane and capsule**.",
