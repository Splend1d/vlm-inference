The number of 0's in \\( x \\) is divisible by \\( k \\).\n2. The number of 1's in \\( x \\) is odd.\n\nWe can represent the number of 0's in \\( x \\) as \\( n \\), where \\( n \\) is divisible by \\( k \\). Similarly, we can represent the number of 1's in \\( x \\) as \\( m \\), where \\( m \\) is odd.\n\nSince \\( n \\) is divisible by \\( k \\), we can write \\( n = k \\cdot a \\), where \\( a \\) is an integer.\n\nSince \\( m \\) is odd, we can write \\( m = 2 \\cdot b + 1 \\), where \\( b \\) is an integer.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible values of \\( n \\) and \\( m \\) modulo \\( k \\):\n\n* If \\( n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{k} \\), then \\( x \\) has no 1's.\n* If \\( n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{k} \\), then \\( x \\) has one 1.\n* If \\( n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{k} \\), then \\( x \\) has two 1's.\n* ...\n* If \\( n \\equiv k-1 \\pmod{k} \\), then \\( x \\) has \\( k-1 \\) 1's.\n\nSimilarly, if \\( m \\equiv 0 \\pmod{k} \\), then \\( x \\) has no 0's.\n\n* If \\( m \\equiv 1 \\pmod{k} \\), then \\( x \\) has one 0.\n* If \\( m \\equiv 2 \\pmod{k} \\), then \\( x \\) has two 0's.\n* ...\n* If \\( m \\equiv k-1 \\pmod{k} \\), then \\( x \\) has \\( k-1 \\) 0's.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible transitions in the DFA:\n\n* If \\( x \\) has no 1's and no 0's, then the DFA has no states.\n* If \\( x \\) has one 1 and one 0, then the DFA has two states.\n* If \\( x \\) has two 1's and two 0's, then the DFA has four states.\n* ...\n* If \\( x \\) has \\( k-1 \\) 1's and \\( k-1 \\) 0's, then the DFA has \\( 2(k-1) \\) states.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of states in a DFA that recognizes L is \\( 2(k-1) \\).\n\nHowever, this is not among the answer choices.
