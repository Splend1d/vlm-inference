            "content": "Relaxation Voltage Controlled Oscillators (RVCOs) are a type of oscillator that can generate both triangular and sawtooth waves. These waves are characterized by their linear rise and fall, which is achieved through the relaxation of a voltage across a capacitor.\n\n- **Sinusoidal wave**: This is a smooth, periodic wave that oscillates between a maximum and minimum value. RVCOs can generate sinusoidal waves, but they are not specifically designed for this purpose.\n\n- **Triangular wave**: This wave has a linear rise and fall, creating a sawtooth shape. RVCOs can generate triangular waves by controlling the relaxation voltage.\n\n- **Sawtooth wave**: This wave also has a linear rise and fall, but it starts at zero and ends at a maximum value. RVCOs can generate sawtooth waves by controlling the relaxation voltage.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Both B and C",
