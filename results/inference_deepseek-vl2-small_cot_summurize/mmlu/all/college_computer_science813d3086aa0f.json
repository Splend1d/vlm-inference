Information in this node includes (1) the owner of the file, (2) a count of the number of links to the tile, and (3) the disk block numbers of the file. What is a primary drawback to this approach to sharing?\n\nA. If the owner modifies the file, another user who does not share will see the changes.\nB. If the owner renames the file, other users will not be able to access it.\nC. If the owner is allowed to delete a file, dangling links may result.\nD. If any user who shares the file appends to it, others who share it will not be able to access the new disk blocks.\n",

If the owner modifies the file, another user who does not share will see the changes.\n- This is not a drawback because the owner's modifications are intended to be visible to all users who have access to the file. This is a feature, not a drawback.\n\nB. If the owner renames the file, other users will not be able to access it.\n- This is not a drawback because the owner can rename the file without affecting the access of other users. The rename operation is a normal file management operation and does not impact the shared nature of the file.\n\nC. If the owner is allowed to delete a file, dangling links may result.\n- This is a potential drawback. When the owner deletes a file, the links that point to it will become dangling, meaning they will no longer point to any valid location. This can lead to confusion and inefficiency in the system, as users may not be aware that the file has been deleted.\n\nD. If any user who shares the file appends to it, others who share it will not be able to access the new disk blocks.\n- This is not a drawback because the file is shared, and any user can append to it. The system is designed to handle concurrent modifications, and the new disk blocks will be accessible to all users who have the necessary permissions.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the primary drawback to this approach to sharing is:\n\nC. If the owner is allowed to delete a file, dangling links may result.",
