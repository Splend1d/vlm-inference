            "content": "To find the number of pies, \\( p \\), Carl baked for each of the school fund-raisers, we need to set up an equation based on the information given.\n\nCarl baked a total of 18 pies. He baked 6 pies for his family and \\( p \\) pies for each of the 4 school fund-raisers. Therefore, the total number of pies can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ 6 + 4p = 18 \\]\n\nThis equation represents the total number of pies Carl baked, which is 18.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. \\( 6 \\times p - 18 = 4 \\)\n   - This equation does not correctly represent the total number of pies. It suggests a subtraction of 18 from 6 times \\( p \\), which does not equal 4.\n\nB. \\( 18 - 6 \\times p = 4 \\)\n   - This equation suggests subtracting 6 times \\( p \\) from 18 to get 4, which is not correct. The correct equation should be \\( 6 + 4p = 18 \\).\n\nC. \\( 4 + 6 \\times p = 18 \\)\n   - This equation is incorrect because it suggests adding 6 times \\( p \\) to 4 to get 18, which is not the correct relationship.\n\nD. \\( 6 + 4 \\times p = 18 \\)\n   - This equation correctly represents the total number of pies Carl baked. It shows that 6 pies were for his family and \\( 4p \\) pies were for the school fund-raisers.\n\nTherefore, the correct number sentence to find the number of pies, \\( p \\), Carl baked for each of the school fund-raisers is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]",
