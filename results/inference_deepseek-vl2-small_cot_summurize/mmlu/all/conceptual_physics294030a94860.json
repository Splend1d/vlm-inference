            "content": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the mutual induction process and its implications.\n\nMutual induction occurs when a changing magnetic field induces an electric field, and conversely, a changing electric field induces a magnetic field. This phenomenon is a fundamental principle in electromagnetism, as described by Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction.\n\n1. **Electric Field Induction**: When a magnetic field changes, it induces an electric field. This is the principle behind many electrical devices, such as transformers and generators. The induced electric field can drive current in a conductor, thus producing energy.\n\n2. **Magnetic Field Induction**: Conversely, a changing electric field can induce a magnetic field. This is the principle behind the operation of electric motors and generators. The induced magnetic field can cause a current to flow in a conductor, thus producing energy.\n\nGiven this understanding, mutual induction can indeed produce both light and energy.\n\n- **Light**: This is produced when an electric field induces a magnetic field, which in turn induces an electric field, creating a wave of electromagnetic radiation. This process is the basis for light generation in devices like light bulbs and lasers.\n\n- **Energy**: As mentioned, the mutual induction of electric and magnetic fields can produce energy. This is the principle behind the operation of transformers, generators, and motors.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Both of these\n\nThis comprehensive understanding of mutual induction highlights its role in both generating light and producing energy, making option C the correct choice.",
