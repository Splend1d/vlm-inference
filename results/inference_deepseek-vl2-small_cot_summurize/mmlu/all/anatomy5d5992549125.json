            "content": "To determine which cavities are separated by the diaphragm, we need to understand the anatomical structure of the diaphragm and the locations of the cavities it separates.\n\nThe diaphragm is a dome-shaped muscle that plays a crucial role in respiration by contracting and relaxing to allow air to enter and exit the thoracic cavity. It separates the thoracic cavity from the abdominal cavity.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Abdominal and pelvic**: The diaphragm separates the thoracic cavity from the abdominal cavity, not the pelvic cavity. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\nB. **Cranial and spinal**: The diaphragm does not separate the cranial cavity from the spinal cavity. The cranial cavity is located above the diaphragm, and the spinal cavity is below it. Thus, this option is incorrect.\n\nC. **Thoracic and abdominal**: The diaphragm is the muscle that separates the thoracic cavity, which contains the heart and lungs, from the abdominal cavity, which contains the digestive organs. This is the correct separation.\n\nD. **Pericardial and pleural**: The pericardium is a sac that surrounds the heart, and the pleura is a membrane that covers the lungs. These structures are not separated by the diaphragm. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\nAfter evaluating each option, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Thoracic and abdominal.",
