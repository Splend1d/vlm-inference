            "content": "To determine when the next major impact on Earth might occur, we need to consider the geological and astronomical factors that influence such events.\n\n1. **Understanding Impacts**: Major impacts on Earth are typically caused by objects from space, such as asteroids or comets. These objects can cause significant damage to the planet, including large-scale destruction and changes in the Earth's climate.\n\n2. **Historical Context**: The Earth has experienced several major impact events throughout its history. The most well-known is the Chicxulub impact, which is believed to have caused the extinction of the dinosaurs around 66 million years ago.\n\n3. **Current State**: After the period of heavy bombardment, which ended about 3.8 billion years ago, the Earth has experienced a relatively stable period with fewer major impacts. However, the probability of impact is not zero, and the Earth is still subject to impacts from space.\n\n4. **Probability and Timing**: The probability of a major impact occurring is not constant over time. It can vary due to factors such as the size and composition of the object, the Earth's orbit, and the presence of other celestial bodies.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Given the historical context and current state of the Earth, the probability of a major impact occurring is not the same every year. It can vary significantly over time.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Could be any time. The probability of impact is the same next year as it is for any later year.",
