H+(aq) - Hydrogen ions in aqueous solution are not suitable for amalgamation because they do not provide the necessary metallic properties to reduce substances to a desired oxidation state.\n\nB. Na(s) - Sodium metal is a good candidate for substitution because it is a metal and can participate in redox reactions. However, it is not commonly used in amalgamation due to its reactivity and the fact that it is not as effective as silver in reducing substances.\n\nC. Ca2+(aq) - Calcium ions in aqueous solution are not suitable for amalgamation because they do not provide the necessary metallic properties to reduce substances to a desired oxidation state.\n\nD. Mg(s) - Magnesium metal is a good candidate for substitution because it is a metal and can participate in redox reactions. It is also less reactive than sodium and can be used in amalgamation to reduce substances to a desired oxidation state.\n\nTherefore, the most reasonable and safe substitute for silver metal in amalgamation is magnesium metal (Mg(s)).",
