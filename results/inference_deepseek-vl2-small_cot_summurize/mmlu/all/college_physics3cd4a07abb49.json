The work done by the force on the box is equal to the change in kinetic energy of the box.\n\nThe initial kinetic energy of the box is:\n\\[ KE_i = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \\frac{1}{2}(10)(1)^2 = 5 \\text{ J} \\]\n\nThe final kinetic energy of the box is:\n\\[ KE_f = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \\frac{1}{2}(10)(2)^2 = 20 \\text{ J} \\]\n\nThe work done by the force is:\n\\[ W = KE_f - KE_i = 20 - 5 = 15 \\text{ J} \\]\n\nThe work done by the force is also equal to the force multiplied by the distance traveled:\n\\[ W = Fd \\]\n\nwhere \\( F \\) is the force and \\( d \\) is the distance traveled.\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for \\( F \\), we get:\n\\[ F = \\frac{W}{d} = \\frac{15}{5} = 3 \\text{ N} \\]\n\nSo, the magnitude of the applied force is:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ N} \\]",
