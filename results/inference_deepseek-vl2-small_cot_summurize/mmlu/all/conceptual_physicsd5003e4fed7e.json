However, Einstein's theory of relativity, particularly the special theory of relativity, shows that space and time are not separate entities but are interconnected as a single entity known as spacetime.\n\nB. **are parts of one whole.**\n   - This option aligns with Einstein's theory of relativity, which posits that space and time are not separate but are part of a unified four-dimensional spacetime continuum. This concept is encapsulated in the famous equation \\( E = mc^2 \\), where \\( E \\) represents energy, \\( m \\) represents mass, and \\( c \\) is the speed of light.\n\nC. **follow an inverse-square law.**\n   - This option refers to the inverse-square law, which is a principle in physics that describes the relationship between the intensity of a field and the square of the distance from the source of the field. While this law is important in physics, it does not directly describe the relationship between space and time as understood by Einstein.\n\nD. **are special to space travelers.**\n   - This option suggests that space and time are unique or special to space travelers. However, this is not a scientific concept but rather a philosophical or speculative idea. The theory of relativity does not imply that space and time are special to any particular observer.\n\nGiven the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nB. **are parts of one whole.**",
