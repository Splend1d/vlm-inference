The proposition is:\n\n\\[\n(\u2200x)[Ax \u2283 (\u2203y)(Hy \u2022 Bxy)]\n\\]\n\nLet's break down the components:\n\n- \\(Ax\\): \\(x\\) is an apartment.\n- \\(Hx\\): \\(x\\) is a house.\n- \\(Lx\\): \\(x\\) is large.\n- \\(Bxy\\): \\(x\\) is bigger than \\(y\\).\n\nThe proposition states that for every apartment \\(x\\), there exists a house \\(y\\) such that the house \\(y\\) is larger than the apartment \\(x\\).\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Every apartment is bigger than some house.**\n   - This statement is true because if \\(x\\) is an apartment, then by the proposition, there must exist a house \\(y\\) such that \\(y\\) is larger than \\(x\\).\n\nB. **Every house is bigger than all apartments.**\n   - This statement is not necessarily true. The proposition only guarantees that there exists a house larger than every apartment, not that every house is larger than every apartment.\n\nC. **Every house is bigger than some apartment.**\n   - This statement is not necessarily true. The proposition only guarantees that there exists a house larger than every apartment, not that every house is larger than every apartment.\n\nD. **Some house is bigger than every apartment.**\n   - This statement is not necessarily true. The proposition only guarantees that there exists a house larger than every apartment, not that every house is larger than every apartment.\n\nGiven the analysis, the best English interpretation of the given proposition is:\n\n**A. Every apartment is bigger than some house.**\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{A}\n\\]",
