            "content": "To determine which option would occur if Congress passed a bill and the president took no action within ten days, we need to understand the different types of vetoes and their implications.\n\nA. **A line-item veto**: This is a type of veto that allows the president to reject specific provisions of a bill without vetoing the entire bill. However, this power was eliminated by the 1996 Supreme Court decision in **NLRB v. Yeshiva University**. Therefore, a line-item veto is not an option.\n\nB. **A pocket veto**: This occurs when the president does not sign a bill within ten days, and Congress is not in session. Since Congress is in session when the bill is passed, a pocket veto is not applicable.\n\nC. **An adjournment**: This is a procedural act by Congress to end its session. If Congress adjourns, the bill would not become law, as the legislative process would be paused.\n\nD. **A writ of certiorari**: This is a legal process where a higher court reviews a lower court's decision. It is not related to the legislative process or the president's action on a bill.\n\nGiven the options, the correct answer is **C. An adjournment**. If Congress adjourns, the bill would not become law, as the legislative process would be paused.",
