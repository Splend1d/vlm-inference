It is the nerve that would require local anaesthesia to carry out a pain-free biopsy of the labial alveolar mucosa of the lower right lateral incisor tooth.\n\nThe incisive nerve (A) is a branch of the maxillary nerve and provides sensation to the anterior two-thirds of the hard palate. The buccal nerve (C) is a branch of the mandibular nerve and provides sensation to the buccal mucosa of the lower teeth. The lingual nerve (D) is a branch of the mandibular nerve and provides sensation to the tongue. None of these nerves would be responsible for the sensation of the lower lip and chin, which is why the mental nerve is the correct answer.",
