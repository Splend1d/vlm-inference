            "content": "To determine what happens when an object is set vibrating by a wave with a matching frequency, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Forced vibration**: This occurs when an external force is applied to a system, causing it to vibrate at a frequency that matches the natural frequency of the system. This is a common occurrence in many mechanical and electrical systems.\n\nB. **Resonance**: This is a specific type of forced vibration where the frequency of the external force matches the natural frequency of the system, leading to a large amplitude of vibration. Resonance can be beneficial or detrimental, depending on the context.\n\nC. **Refraction**: This is the bending of waves as they pass from one medium to another, typically due to a change in speed. Refraction is not related to the vibration of an object by a wave.\n\nD. **Amplitude reduction**: This refers to the decrease in the size of the wave's amplitude, which can occur due to various factors such as absorption or scattering. It is not directly related to the vibration of an object by a wave.\n\nGiven the options, the correct answer is:\n\nB. **Resonance**\n\nWhen an object is set vibrating by a wave with a matching frequency, resonance occurs. This is because the external force applied to the object is at the same frequency as its natural frequency, leading to a significant increase in the amplitude of vibration.",
