This term is used in urban geography to describe the dominant city that has a significant influence over the surrounding areas, often due to its size, economic power, and cultural significance. The other options do not accurately describe a primate city:\n\nA. a large city located on the periphery of the country.\n- This describes a satellite city or a city on the outskirts, not necessarily the largest city in the country.\n\nB. the most important city in a country.\n- This is too vague and does not specify the size or influence of the city.\n\nC. when the largest city in a country is more than twice the size of the next largest city.\n- This describes a situation where the largest city is significantly larger than the next largest, but it does not define the primate city as the largest city in the country.",
