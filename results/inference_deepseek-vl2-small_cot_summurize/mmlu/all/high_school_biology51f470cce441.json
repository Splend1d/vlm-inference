            "content": "To determine which statement is NOT correct about Barr bodies, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. In the early female embryo, one copy of the X chromosome becomes inactivated in every body cell.\n- This statement is correct. In female mammals, the X chromosome is inactivated in all somatic cells to ensure dosage compensation between males and females. This process is known as X-chromosome inactivation.\n\nB. The same chromosome in every cell of a normal female is inactivated.\n- This statement is incorrect. In a normal female, only one of the two X chromosomes is inactivated in each cell. The other X chromosome remains active and is present in all cells.\n\nC. A male with the XXY genotype will have one Barr body.\n- This statement is correct. Males with the XXY genotype have two X chromosomes. One of these X chromosomes is inactivated in each cell, forming a Barr body.\n\nD. Barr bodies consist of highly methylated DNA.\n- This statement is correct. Barr bodies are characterized by the presence of highly methylated DNA, which is a result of the inactivation process.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the statement that is NOT correct is:\n\nB. The same chromosome in every cell of a normal female is inactivated.",
