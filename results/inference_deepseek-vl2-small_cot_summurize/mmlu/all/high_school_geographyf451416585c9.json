This theory posits that control of this central landmass would give a nation significant power and influence over the rest of the world. The term \"rimland\" refers to the area that encircles the Eurasian landmass, including parts of Europe, Asia, and Africa.\n\nThe other options are:\n\nA. **Devolution theory**: This theory suggests that the power of a nation will decrease as it devolves from its core regions to its peripheral regions.\n\nB. **Domino theory**: This theory, popularized by the United States during the Cold War, suggested that if one country in a region fell to communism, neighboring countries would follow, like a row of dominoes.\n\nC. **Heartland theory**: This theory, also from the Cold War era, suggested that the central part of Eurasia (the \"heartland\") was the key to global power, and control of this area would give a nation significant influence over the rest of the world.",
