This means that the corporation operates as a separate entity from its stakeholders, and it is not controlled by any of them.\n\nA corporation has perpetual succession, which means that it continues to exist indefinitely, even if some of its shareholders or directors change. This is because a corporation is a legal entity that is separate from its shareholders and directors, and it can continue to exist even if some of its shareholders or directors change.\n\nA corporation owns its own assets, which means that it has control over its own property and resources. This is because a corporation is a separate legal entity that can own and control its own assets, and it can use those assets to generate revenue and profit.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Independent, Perpetual, Owns its own assets.",
