            "content": "To determine which statement is true about a lower motor neurone lesion in the arm, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. It leads to increased tone in the arm (hypertonia)\n- A lower motor neurone lesion typically results in decreased muscle tone, not increased. This is because the lower motor neurones are responsible for directly innervating the muscles, and their damage leads to muscle weakness and decreased reflexes. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\nB. Fasciculations are never seen\n- Fasciculations are involuntary muscle contractions that can be observed in conditions such as myasthenia gravis or in the early stages of a lower motor neurone lesion. They are not always absent, especially in the early stages of the lesion. Thus, this statement is incorrect.\n\nC. The reflexes are brisk\n- In a lower motor neurone lesion, reflexes are typically diminished or absent. The reflex arc is disrupted, leading to a loss of the normal reflex response. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\nD. An ulna nerve palsy is an example of a lower motor neurone lesion\n- The ulna nerve is responsible for innervating the muscles of the forearm and hand. A palsy of the ulna nerve can result from a lower motor neurone lesion, leading to weakness or paralysis of the muscles it innervates. This statement is correct.\n\nAfter evaluating each option, the correct answer is D. An ulna nerve palsy is an example of a lower motor neurone lesion.",
