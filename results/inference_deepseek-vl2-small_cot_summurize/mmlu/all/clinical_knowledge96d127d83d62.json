The purpose of stretching is to increase flexibility and prevent injury, and a very short stretch may not achieve these goals.\n\nB. 10-30 seconds: This range is often considered the minimum time for stretching. During this period, muscles can be stretched to a point where they are more pliable, which can help improve flexibility and reduce the risk of injury.\n\nC. 30-50 seconds: While this duration is longer than 10-30 seconds, it may not be necessary for all stretches. Some stretches can be held for shorter periods, depending on the individual's flexibility and the specific stretch being performed.\n\nD. 60 seconds: Holding a stretch for 60 seconds is generally considered too long for most stretches. Prolonged stretching can lead to muscle fatigue and potential injury, as the muscles may not be able to recover quickly enough.\n\nBased on this analysis, the minimum time a stretch should be held for is 10-30 seconds. This duration allows for effective stretching while minimizing the risk of injury.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 10-30 seconds.",
