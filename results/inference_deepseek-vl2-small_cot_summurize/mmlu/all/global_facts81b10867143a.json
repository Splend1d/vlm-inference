            "content": "To determine the percentage of people from Russia who believe homosexuality should be accepted by society, we need to consider the available data and trends from 2019.\n\n1. **Understanding the Context**: In 2019, Russia was experiencing significant social and political changes. The country had recently passed laws that restricted LGBTQ+ rights, including a law banning \"propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations\" among minors. This context is crucial as it influences public opinion on LGBTQ+ issues.\n\n2. **Analyzing Public Opinion**: Surveys and studies conducted in 2019 indicated that a majority of Russians were opposed to the acceptance of homosexuality. This opposition was largely influenced by the political climate and the government's stance on LGBTQ+ rights.\n\n3. **Evaluating the Options**:\n   - **Option A (14%)**: This option suggests a relatively low level of acceptance, which is unlikely given the political climate and societal norms at the time.\n   - **Option B (24%)**: This option is plausible but still lower than the majority opinion.\n   - **Option C (34%)**: This option is more consistent with the general public sentiment in Russia during 2019, where a significant portion of the population opposed LGBTQ+ acceptance.\n   - **Option D (44%)**: This option suggests a higher level of acceptance than the majority opinion, which is not supported by the available data.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Given the political and social environment in Russia in 2019, the most accurate answer is that a majority of people, approximately 34%, believed homosexuality should not be accepted by society.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **C. 34%**.",
