At the beginning of the experiment, the axon is at rest and has a threshold measured at \u201370 mV at 37oC. The axon receives one stimulus that triggers one action potential in the axon. Subsequent stimuli are much stronger. Which of the following statements explains what happens when several strong stimuli are experienced by the axon?\n\nA. The axon becomes hyperpolarized to \u201390 mV.\nB. The axon becomes hyperpolarized to \u201350 mV.\nC. The strength of the action potential becomes greater.\nD. The frequency of the action potential increases.\n",

            "content": "To understand the effects of multiple strong stimuli on the axon, we need to consider the properties of action potentials and the role of the sodium-potassium pump in maintaining the resting membrane potential.\n\n1. **Resting Membrane Potential**: The resting membrane potential of a neuron is typically around -70 mV. This is maintained by the sodium-potassium pump, which actively transports sodium ions out of the cell and potassium ions into the cell, using ATP.\n\n2. **Hyperpolarization**: When a neuron is stimulated, it can become hyperpolarized, meaning the membrane potential becomes more negative. This occurs because the influx of sodium ions during an action potential makes the inside of the cell more positive than the outside.\n\n3. **Multiple Stimuli**: If a neuron is repeatedly stimulated, the sodium channels open more frequently, allowing more sodium ions to enter the cell. This influx of positive ions further depolarizes the membrane, making it less negative.\n\n4. **Hyperpolarization**: However, if the neuron is stimulated too many times, the sodium channels may become desensitized, and the sodium-potassium pump may not be able to restore the resting membrane potential. This can lead to hyperpolarization, where the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential.\n\n5. **Restoration of Resting Potential**: Eventually, the neuron may reach a point where the sodium-potassium pump can restore the resting membrane potential, but this requires time and energy.\n\nGiven these considerations, the correct answer is:\n\nA. The axon becomes hyperpolarized to \u201390 mV.\n\nThis statement accurately describes the effect of multiple strong stimuli on the axon, where the membrane potential becomes more negative due to the continuous influx of sodium ions and the inability of the sodium-potassium pump to restore the resting potential immediately.",
