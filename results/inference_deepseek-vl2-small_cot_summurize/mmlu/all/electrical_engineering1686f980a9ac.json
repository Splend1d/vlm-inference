This is because the moving coil is designed to measure current, and a low resistance ensures that the current flowing through the coil is minimal, allowing for accurate measurement of the current. A high resistance would cause a significant drop in current, making it difficult to measure the current accurately. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Very low.",
