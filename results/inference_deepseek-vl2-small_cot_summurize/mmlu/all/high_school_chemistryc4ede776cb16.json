            "content": "To determine the rate law from the given information, we need to analyze the graphs provided.\n\n1. **Graph of [A] versus time**: This graph shows a curved line, indicating that the rate of reaction is not constant over time. This suggests that the reaction is not first-order with respect to A.\n\n2. **Graph of ln [A] versus time**: This graph also shows a curved line, which further supports that the reaction is not first-order with respect to A.\n\n3. **Graph of 1/[A] versus time**: This graph gives a straight line. For a reaction to be first-order with respect to A, the plot of 1/[A] versus time should be linear. This indicates that the reaction is first-order with respect to A.\n\n4. **Rate Law**: The rate law for a first-order reaction with respect to A is given by Rate = k[A]. This means the rate of the reaction is directly proportional to the concentration of A.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since the graph of 1/[A] versus time is linear, the reaction is first-order with respect to A. Therefore, the rate law is Rate = k[A].\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Rate = k[A]",
