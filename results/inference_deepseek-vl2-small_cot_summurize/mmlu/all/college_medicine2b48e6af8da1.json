            "content": "To determine which substance releases the most energy when completely oxidized, we need to consider the energy content of each substance.\n\nA. One gram of glucose: Glucose is a simple sugar and is a primary energy source for the body. It is fully oxidized in the mitochondria to produce ATP, the energy currency of the cell. The energy content of glucose is approximately 4 calories per gram.\n\nB. One gram of palmitic acid: Palmitic acid is a long-chain fatty acid. It is also oxidized in the mitochondria to produce ATP. However, the energy content of palmitic acid is lower than that of glucose. It is approximately 9 calories per gram.\n\nC. One gram of leucine: Leucine is an essential amino acid, which means it must be obtained through the diet. It is not oxidized for energy in the body.\n\nD. One gram of alcohol: Alcohol, such as ethanol, is not oxidized for energy in the body. It is metabolized in the liver to produce acetaldehyde, which is then converted to acetate. The energy content of alcohol is very low, approximately 7 calories per gram.\n\nBased on the energy content of each substance, one gram of glucose releases the most energy when completely oxidized in the body. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. One gram of glucose",
