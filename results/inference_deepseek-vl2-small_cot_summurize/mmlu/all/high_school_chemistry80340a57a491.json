            "content": "To determine which statement is correct, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. The N-H bonds within the NH3 molecules break apart.\n- During the boiling process, the temperature of the liquid increases, causing the kinetic energy of the molecules to increase. This energy is sufficient to overcome the intermolecular forces, specifically the hydrogen bonds, that hold the NH3 molecules together. As a result, the N-H bonds within the NH3 molecules break apart, allowing the molecules to transition from a liquid to a gas phase. This statement is correct.\n\nB. The overall temperature of the solution rises as the NH3 molecules speed up.\n- While it is true that the temperature of the solution rises as the NH3 molecules gain kinetic energy, this statement does not specifically address the breaking of the N-H bonds. The temperature increase is a result of the increased kinetic energy, not the breaking of bonds. Therefore, this statement is not correct.\n\nC. The amount of energy within the system remains constant.\n- The amount of energy within the system does not remain constant during boiling. As the temperature increases, the kinetic energy of the molecules increases, which means the energy within the system is increasing. This statement is incorrect.\n\nD. The hydrogen bonds holding separate NH3 molecules together break apart.\n- The hydrogen bonds are the intermolecular forces that hold the NH3 molecules together. During boiling, these bonds are broken as the molecules transition from a liquid to a gas phase. This statement is correct.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the correct statements are A and D. Both describe the process of boiling, where the N-H bonds within the NH3 molecules break apart, and the hydrogen bonds holding separate NH3 molecules together break apart.",
