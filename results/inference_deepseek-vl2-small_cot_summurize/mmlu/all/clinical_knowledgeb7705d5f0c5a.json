            "content": "To determine which statement is true, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. IV administration of a drug will delay its action.\n- This statement is incorrect. Intravenous (IV) administration is one of the fastest ways to deliver a drug into the bloodstream, resulting in rapid onset of action. The drug bypasses the gastrointestinal tract, liver, and first-pass metabolism, allowing it to reach systemic circulation quickly.\n\nB. IV administration carries low risk of bacteraemia.\n- This statement is incorrect. Intravenous administration carries a higher risk of bacteraemia (bacterial infection) compared to other routes of administration. The direct entry of bacteria into the bloodstream increases the likelihood of infection.\n\nC. IV administration allows titration of a drug with its desired effect.\n- This statement is correct. Intravenous administration allows for precise control over the dose and rate of drug administration. This is particularly useful in situations where a rapid response is needed, such as in emergency settings or for patients who cannot take oral medications. Titration, or adjusting the dose to achieve the desired effect, is possible with IV administration.\n\nD. An intravenous cannula should never be used for both drug and fluid administration.\n- This statement is incorrect. In practice, intravenous cannulas are often used for both drug and fluid administration. This is a common practice in medical settings to ensure that patients receive necessary medications and fluids simultaneously.\n\nAfter evaluating each option, the correct answer is:\n\nC. IV administration allows titration of a drug with its desired effect.",
