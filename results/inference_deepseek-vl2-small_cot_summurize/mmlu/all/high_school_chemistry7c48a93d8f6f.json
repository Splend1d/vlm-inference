The molecular geometry is tetrahedral because the central atom has four regions of electron density (the four P-F bonds) and no lone pairs, resulting in a symmetrical shape.\n\nB. **BF3**: Boron (B) is the central atom, surrounded by three fluorine (F) atoms. The molecular geometry is trigonal planar because the central atom has three regions of electron density (the three B-F bonds) and no lone pairs, resulting in a flat, triangular shape.\n\nC. **CO2**: Carbon (C) is the central atom, surrounded by two oxygen (O) atoms. The molecular geometry is linear because the central atom has two regions of electron density (the two C=O bonds) and no lone pairs, resulting in a straight line.\n\nD. **CBr4**: Carbon (C) is the central atom, surrounded by four bromine (Br) atoms. The molecular geometry is tetrahedral because the central atom has four regions of electron density (the four C-Br bonds) and no lone pairs, resulting in a symmetrical shape.\n\nBoth PCl4F and CBr4 have a tetrahedral shape. However, the question asks for a single answer, and typically, the first correct answer is chosen. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. PCl4F",
