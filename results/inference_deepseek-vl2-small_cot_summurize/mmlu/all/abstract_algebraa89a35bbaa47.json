            "content": "Fermat's Little Theorem states that if p is a prime number, then for any integer a, a^p \u2261 a (mod p). In this case, p = 23, and we want to find the remainder of 3^47 when divided by 23.\n\nAccording to Fermat's Little Theorem, 3^23 \u2261 1 (mod 23). Now, we can use this result to find the remainder of 3^47 when divided by 23.\n\nWe can write 3^47 as (3^23) * (3^24). Since 3^23 \u2261 1 (mod 23), we have:\n\n3^47 \u2261 1 * (3^24) (mod 23)\n\nNow, we need to find the remainder of 3^24 when divided by 23. We can use the fact that 3^2 \u2261 9 (mod 23) and 3^4 \u2261 81 \u2261 12 (mod 23).\n\n3^24 \u2261 (3^4)^6 \u2261 12^6 (mod 23)\n\nNow, we can calculate 12^6 (mod 23):\n\n12^6 \u2261 (12^2)^3 \u2261 144^3 (mod 23)\n\n144 \u2261 12 (mod 23)\n\n12^3 \u2261 12 * 12 * 12 \u2261 1728 \u2261 1 (mod 23)\n\nSo, 12^6 \u2261 1 (mod 23).\n\nNow, we can find the remainder of 3^47 when divided by 23:\n\n3^47 \u2261 1 * 1 (mod 23)\n\n3^47 \u2261 1 (mod 23)\n\nThe remainder of 3^47 when divided by 23 is 1. However, this is not one of the answer choices. It seems there might be an error in the problem statement or the answer choices.",
