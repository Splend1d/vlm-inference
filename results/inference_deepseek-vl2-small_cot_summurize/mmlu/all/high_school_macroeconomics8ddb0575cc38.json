These stabilizers can prevent both inflation and recessions from occurring.\n\nA. Prevent inflation: Automatic stabilizers can help prevent inflation by reducing the money supply or increasing taxes when the economy is overheating, which can lead to inflation.\n\nB. Prevent recessions from occurring: Automatic stabilizers can also help prevent recessions by increasing government spending or cutting taxes when the economy is slowing down, which can stimulate demand and prevent a recession.\n\nD. Are government policies already in place that promote deficit spending during recessions and surplus budgets during expansions: This option is not entirely accurate. While automatic stabilizers do involve government policies, they are not specifically designed to promote deficit spending during recessions and surplus budgets during expansions. Instead, they are designed to stabilize the economy by adjusting fiscal and monetary policies automatically in response to economic conditions.",
