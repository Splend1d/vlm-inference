The spring constant can be determined using Hooke's Law, which states:\n   \\[\n   F = kx\n   \\]\n   where \\( F \\) is the force exerted by the spring. For a mass on a spring, the force is equal to the mass times the acceleration due to gravity \\( g \\):\n   \\[\n   F = mg\n   \\]\n   Therefore:\n   \\[\n   mg = kx \\implies k = \\frac{mg}{x}\n   \\]\n\n   Substituting the given values:\n   \\[\n   k = \\frac{0.30 \\times 9.81}{0.030} = 98.1 \\, \\text{N/m}\n   \\]\n\n   Now, calculate the potential energy:\n   \\[\n   PE = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 98.1 \\times (0.030)^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 98.1 \\times 0.0009 = 0.0485 \\, \\text{J}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the Kinetic Energy (KE) of the Mass:**\n\n   The kinetic energy of the mass is given by:\n   \\[\n   KE = \\frac{1}{2} mv^2\n   \\]\n   where \\( v \\) is the speed of the mass.\n\n   Given:\n   - Mass \\( m = 0.30 \\, \\text{kg} \\)\n   - Speed \\( v = 0.040 \\, \\text{m/s} \\)\n\n   Substituting the given values:\n   \\[\n   KE = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 0.30 \\times (0.040)^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 0.30 \\times 0.0016 = 0.00024 \\, \\text{J}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Total Mechanical Energy (E):**\n\n   The total mechanical energy of the system is the sum of the potential energy and the kinetic energy:\n   \\[\n   E = PE + KE = 0.0485 \\, \\text{J} + 0.00024 \\, \\text{J} = 0.04874 \\, \\text{J}\n   \\]\n\n   Rounding to two decimal places, the total mechanical energy is approximately 0.0487 mJ.\n\n   Therefore, the correct answer is:\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{0.048 \\, \\text{mJ}}\n   \\]",
