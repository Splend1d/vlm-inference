This means that every element in the group can be written as a power of this generator. The order of the group is the smallest positive integer \\( n \\) such that the identity element is not equal to the generator.\n\nTo show that for every positive integer \\( n \\), there is a cyclic group of order \\( n \\), we can use the following argument:\n\n1. Consider the set of integers \\(\\{0, 1, 2, \\ldots, n-1\\}\\).\n2. Define a binary operation on this set, where \\( a \\cdot b = a + b \\mod n \\).\n3. This operation is well-defined because it is the same as addition modulo \\( n \\).\n4. The set \\(\\{0, 1, 2, \\ldots, n-1\\}\\) is closed under this operation.\n5. The identity element is \\( 0 \\).\n6. The group is cyclic because any element \\( a \\) in the set can be written as \\( a = k \\cdot 0 \\) for some integer \\( k \\).\n\nThus, for every positive integer \\( n \\), there is a cyclic group of order \\( n \\). Therefore, Statement 1 is true.\n\n**Statement 2: Every finite cyclic group contains an element of every order that divides the order of the group.**\n\nA finite cyclic group of order \\( n \\) has elements of orders that are divisors of \\( n \\). This is a consequence of Lagrange's theorem, which states that the order of any subgroup of a finite group divides the order of the group.\n\nTo see why this is true, consider the cyclic group \\( \\mathbb{Z}_n \\):\n\n1. The order of \\( \\mathbb{Z}_n \\) is \\( n \\).\n2. The divisors of \\( n \\) are \\( 1, 2, 3, \\ldots, n \\).\n3. Each divisor \\( d \\) of \\( n \\) corresponds to an element of order \\( d \\) in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_n \\).\n\nFor example, if \\( n = 6 \\), the divisors are \\( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \\). The elements of order 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are \\( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \\) respectively.\n\nThus, every finite cyclic group contains an element of every order that divides the order of the group. Therefore, Statement 2 is true.\n\nSince both statements are true, the correct answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{A}\n\\]",
