            "content": "To determine which statement is incorrect, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Asymptotically, the values of the two test statistics will be equal.\n- The Box-Pierce Q and Ljung-Box Q* statistics are both designed to test for the presence of autocorrelation in a time series. They are asymptotically equivalent, meaning that as the sample size increases, the distributions of the two test statistics converge to the same distribution. Therefore, this statement is correct.\n\nB. The Q test has better small-sample properties than the Q*\n- The Q test is known for having better small-sample properties compared to the Q* test. This means that the Q test is more sensitive to detecting autocorrelation in small samples. Therefore, this statement is correct.\n\nC. The Q test is sometimes over-sized for small samples\n- The Q test is indeed over-sized for small samples, meaning that it tends to reject the null hypothesis of no autocorrelation even when there is none. This is because the Q test is more sensitive to detecting autocorrelation in small samples. Therefore, this statement is correct.\n\nD. As the sample size tends towards infinity, both tests will show a tendency to always reject the null hypothesis of zero autocorrelation coefficients.\n- This statement is incorrect. While both tests are asymptotically equivalent, they do not always reject the null hypothesis of zero autocorrelation in finite samples. The Q test is known for its over-sized nature in small samples, which can lead to false positives. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\nThus, the incorrect statement is D. As the sample size tends towards infinity, both tests will show a tendency to always reject the null hypothesis of zero autocorrelation coefficients.",
