            "content": "To understand why a patient's HIV population becomes entirely 3TC-resistant, we need to consider the mechanisms of drug resistance in HIV.\n\nA. HIV can change its surface proteins and resist vaccines.\n- While HIV can mutate its surface proteins, this mutation is not directly related to drug resistance. Vaccines target surface proteins, but the resistance here is due to the virus's ability to survive drug treatment, not due to changes in surface proteins.\n\nB. The patient must have become reinfected with 3TC-resistant viruses.\n- This option is unlikely because reinfection would typically introduce new viral strains, not just resistant ones. The resistance observed is due to the existing virus population adapting to the drug, not a new infection.\n\nC. HIV began making drug-resistant versions of reverse transcriptase in response to the drug.\n- This is the correct explanation. Reverse transcriptase is the enzyme HIV uses to convert its RNA into DNA. When a drug like 3TC is present, it can inhibit this enzyme, leading to the accumulation of resistant viral strains. Over time, the resistant strains become the dominant population as they are better able to survive the drug.\n\nD. A few drug-resistant viruses were present at the start of treatment, and natural selection increased their frequency.\n- This option is incorrect because the presence of drug-resistant viruses at the start of treatment is not a natural selection process. Natural selection would require a genetic advantage, which is not the case here. The resistance arises from the drug's effect on the virus, not from a natural selection process.\n\nTherefore, the best explanation for the development of 3TC-resistant HIV is that the virus began producing drug-resistant versions of reverse transcriptase in response to the drug, leading to the dominance of resistant strains.\n\nThe correct answer is C.",
