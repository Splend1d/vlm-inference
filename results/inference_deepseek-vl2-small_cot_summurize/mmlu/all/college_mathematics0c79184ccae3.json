This square is centered at the origin \\((0, 0)\\) and has a side length of 2.\n\nThe condition \\(2(x + y) > 1\\) can be rewritten as \\(x + y > \\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nTo find the probability that a point \\((x, y)\\) chosen from the square satisfies \\(x + y > \\frac{1}{2}\\), we need to find the area of the region where \\(x + y > \\frac{1}{2}\\) and divide it by the total area of the square.\n\nThe region where \\(x + y > \\frac{1}{2}\\) is the area above the line \\(x + y = \\frac{1}{2}\\). This line passes through the points \\((0, \\frac{1}{2})\\) and \\((\\frac{1}{2}, 0)\\).\n\nThe area of the region above the line \\(x + y = \\frac{1}{2}\\) is a right triangle with vertices at \\((0, \\frac{1}{2})\\), \\((\\frac{1}{2}, 0)\\), and \\((0, 0)\\).
