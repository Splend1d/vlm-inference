            "content": "To determine which activity poses the greatest personal cybersecurity risk, we need to evaluate the level of security associated with each option.\n\nA. Making a purchase at an online store that uses public key encryption to transmit credit card information: Public key encryption is a strong security measure that ensures the confidentiality and integrity of data. When a website uses this encryption, it protects the credit card information from being intercepted or altered during transmission. Therefore, this activity is considered secure.\n\nB. Paying a bill using a secure electronic payment system: Secure electronic payment systems, such as PayPal or credit card networks, use advanced encryption and security protocols to protect user data. These systems are designed to prevent unauthorized access and ensure that transactions are secure. Thus, this activity is also considered secure.\n\nC. Reserving a hotel room by e-mailing a credit card number to a hotel: E-mailing a credit card number is a significant security risk. E-mail is not a secure method for transmitting sensitive information, as it can be intercepted by hackers. This method lacks the encryption and security measures that are typically used in secure online transactions. Consequently, this activity poses a high cybersecurity risk.\n\nD. Withdrawing money from an ATM using an automated teller machine (ATM): Using an ATM is generally considered secure, as ATMs are equipped with security features such as PINs, card readers, and cameras to protect users. However, it is important to be cautious of physical security risks, such as skimming devices, but the digital security measures are robust. Therefore, this activity is considered secure.\n\nAfter evaluating each option, the activity that poses the greatest personal cybersecurity risk is:\n\nC. Reserving a hotel room by e-mailing a credit card number to a hotel.",
