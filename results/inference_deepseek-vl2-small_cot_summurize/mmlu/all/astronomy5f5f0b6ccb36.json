            "content": "To calculate the ratio of solar radiation flux on Mercury's surface at perihelion and aphelion, we need to understand how the distance from the Sun affects the solar radiation flux. The solar radiation flux is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the Sun.\n\n1. **Understanding the relationship**: The solar radiation flux \\( F \\) is given by the formula:\n   \\[\n   F = \\frac{1}{4\\pi \\sigma T^2}\n   \\]\n   where \\( \\sigma \\) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and \\( T \\) is the temperature of the planet.\n\n2. **Distance and flux relationship**: The flux is inversely proportional to the square of the distance \\( r \\):\n   \\[\n   F \\propto \\frac{1}{r^2}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the ratio of the flux at perihelion to the flux at aphelion is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{F_{\\text{perihelion}}}{F_{\\text{aphelion}}} = \\frac{1}{r_{\\text{aphelion}}^2} \\div \\frac{1}{r_{\\text{perihelion}}^2} = \\frac{1}{r_{\\text{aphelion}}^2} \\times \\frac{r_{\\text{perihelion}}^2}{1} = \\frac{r_{\\text{perihelion}}^2}{r_{\\text{aphelion}}^2}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculating the ratio**: Given that \\( r_{\\text{perihelion}} = 0.304 \\) AU and \\( r_{\\text{aphelion}} = 0.456 \\) AU, we calculate the ratio:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{r_{\\text{perihelion}}^2}{r_{\\text{aphelion}}^2} = \\frac{(0.304)^2}{(0.456)^2}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Performing the calculations**:\n   \\[\n   (0.304)^2 = 0.092416\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   (0.456)^2 = 0.207936\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\frac{0.092416}{0.207936} \\approx 0.444\n   \\]\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The ratio of the solar radiation flux at perihelion to aphelion is approximately 4:1.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 4:1",
