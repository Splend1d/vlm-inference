Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\\[ \\frac{(2^3 - 1)(3^2 - 1)}{2 - 1 \\times 3 - 1} = \\frac{(8 - 1)(9 - 1)}{1 \\times 2} = \\frac{7 \\times 8}{2} = 28 \\]\n\nHowever, this formula counts all possible Abelian groups, not just those with distinct structures. To find the number of structurally distinct Abelian groups, we need to consider the number of ways to partition the exponents \\( (3, 2) \\) into two parts.\n\nThe number of ways to partition \\( (3, 2) \\) is given by the number of partitions of 5, which is 6 (since \\( 5 = 3 + 2 \\)).\n\nTherefore, the number of structurally distinct Abelian groups of order 72 is:\n\\[ \\boxed{6} \\]",
