            "content": "The potentiometer method of DC voltage measurement is more accurate than direct measurement using a voltmeter because it loads the circuit to a lesser extent.\n\nA voltmeter would load the circuit to its maximum extent, which would alter the circuit's characteristics and potentially introduce errors in the measurement. The potentiometer method, on the other hand, loads the circuit to a lesser extent, making it a more accurate method for measuring voltage.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. It loads the circuit moderately.",
