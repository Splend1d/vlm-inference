            "content": "To determine whether the polynomial \\(x^2 - 12\\) satisfies an Eisenstein criterion for irreducibility over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\), we need to check if it satisfies the Eisenstein criterion for any prime \\(p\\). The Eisenstein criterion states that if a polynomial \\(f(x)\\) satisfies the following conditions for any prime \\(p\\) and any integer \\(a\\) not divisible by \\(p\\), then \\(f(x)\\) is irreducible over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\):\n\n1. \\(f(x)\\) has no rational roots.\n2. \\(f(x)\\) is divisible by \\(p\\).\n3. \\(f(x)\\) has a root \\(a\\) such that \\(f(a) = 0\\) and \\(a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}\\).\n\nLet's apply these conditions to the polynomial \\(x^2 - 12\\).\n\n1. **No rational roots:**\n   The polynomial \\(x^2 - 12\\) has no rational roots. This is because the discriminant of the polynomial is \\((-12)^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 0 = 144\\), which is a perfect square. Therefore, by the Rational Root Theorem, any rational root must be a divisor of 12, and since 12 has no rational divisors other than \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 3, \\pm 4, \\pm 6, \\pm 12\\), there are no rational roots.\n\n2. **Divisible by \\(p\\):**\n   We need to check if the polynomial is divisible by any prime \\(p\\). Since \\(p = 2\\) and \\(p = 3\\) are the only primes less than 12, we need to check if \\(x^2 - 12\\) is divisible by 2 and 3.\n\n   - **Divisibility by 2:**\n     \\(x^2 - 12 = (x - \\sqrt{12})(x + \\sqrt{12})\\). Since \\(\\sqrt{12} = 2\\sqrt{3}\\), we have \\(x^2 - 12 = (x - 2\\sqrt{3})(x + 2\\sqrt{3})\\). This is divisible by 2 because it can be factored into two terms, each of which is divisible by 2.\n\n   - **Divisibility by 3:**\n     \\(x^2 - 12 = (x - \\sqrt{12})(x + \\sqrt{12})\\). Since \\(\\sqrt{12} = 2\\sqrt{3}\\), we have \\(x^2 - 12 = (x - 2\\sqrt{3})(x + 2\\sqrt{3})\\). This is divisible by 3 because it can be factored into two terms, each of which is divisible by 3.\n\n3. **Root \\(a\\) such that \\(f(a) = 0\\) and \\(a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}\\):**\n   We need to find an integer \\(a\\) such that \\(a^2 - 12 = 0\\) and \\(a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}\\). Since \\(a^2 - 12 = (a - \\sqrt{12})(a + \\sqrt{12})\\), we need \\(a - \\sqrt{12} = 0\\) and \\(a + \\sqrt{12} = 0\\). This implies \\(a = \\sqrt{12} = 2\\sqrt{3}\\). However, \\(2\\sqrt{3}\\) is not an integer, so this condition is not satisfied for any integer \\(a\\).\n\nSince the polynomial \\(x^2 - 12\\) satisfies the Eisenstein criterion for irreducibility over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) with \\(p = 2\\) and \\(p = 3\\), the correct answer is:\n\nA. Yes, with \\(p = 2\\).",
