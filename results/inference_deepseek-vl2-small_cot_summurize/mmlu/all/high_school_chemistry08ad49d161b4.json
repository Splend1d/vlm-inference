            "content": "To determine the correct answer, we need to analyze the relationship between temperature and the kinetic energy of gas molecules.\n\n1. **Understanding Temperature and Kinetic Energy**: The temperature of a gas is a measure of the average kinetic energy of its molecules. As the temperature increases, the average kinetic energy of the molecules also increases.\n\n2. **Initial and Final Temperatures**: The initial temperature of the oxygen gas is 50 \u00b0C, and the final temperature is 100 \u00b0C.\n\n3. **Temperature Increase**: The temperature increase is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta T = 100 \\, \\text{\u00b0C} - 50 \\, \\text{\u00b0C} = 50 \\, \\text{\u00b0C}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Kinetic Energy Increase**: The kinetic energy of a gas molecule is directly proportional to its temperature. Therefore, the increase in kinetic energy is also proportional to the temperature increase.\n\n5. **Calculating the Factor**: The factor by which the kinetic energy increases is the ratio of the final temperature to the initial temperature:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Factor} = \\frac{100 \\, \\text{\u00b0C}}{50 \\, \\text{\u00b0C}} = 2\n   \\]\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Since the kinetic energy increases by a factor of 2, the correct statement is:\n\nC. Their kinetic energy increases by a factor of 2.",
