In a heterozygous pair, the recessive allele is not visible in the phenotype.\n\nB. **Redundant**: This term is not typically used in genetics to describe alleles. It generally refers to a gene or allele that is not needed because another gene can perform the same function.\n\nC. **Repressed**: This term is not commonly used in genetics to describe alleles. It generally refers to the suppression of gene expression, but it is not a standard term for alleles.\n\nD. **Reclusive**: This term is not used in genetics to describe alleles. It generally means being secretive or hidden, which does not apply to genetic terms.\n\nGiven the definitions and explanations, the correct term for an allele that is masked is:\n\nA. **Recessive**.",
