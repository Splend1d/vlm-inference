            "content": "Public key encryption is advantageous over symmetric key cryptography because of C. Key exchange.\n\nHere's why:\n\n- **Speed**: While public key encryption can be slower than symmetric key encryption, especially for large data sets, it is not necessarily a significant disadvantage. The speed difference is often negligible for most applications.\n\n- **Space**: Public key encryption does not necessarily require more space than symmetric key encryption. Both types of encryption can be implemented efficiently in terms of storage.\n\n- **Key exchange**: This is the primary advantage of public key encryption. Public key encryption allows for secure key exchange over an insecure channel. In symmetric key cryptography, the same key is used for both encryption and decryption, which means that the key must be securely shared between the sender and the receiver. This can be a significant challenge, especially in large networks. Public key encryption, on the other hand, uses a pair of keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. The public key can be freely distributed, while the private key must be kept secret. This allows for secure key exchange without the need to share the same key.\n\n- **Key length**: Public key encryption can have longer key lengths than symmetric key encryption, which can provide stronger security. However, the length of the key is not the primary advantage of public key encryption over symmetric key encryption.\n\nIn summary, the key exchange capability of public key encryption is the main advantage over symmetric key cryptography.",
