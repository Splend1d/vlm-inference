            "content": "To determine which manoeuvre is not a central painful stimulus, we need to understand the concept of central and peripheral pain.\n\nCentral pain refers to pain that originates from the central nervous system (CNS), which includes the brain and spinal cord. Peripheral pain, on the other hand, originates from peripheral nerves and tissues.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Supra-orbital ridge pressure**: This pressure is applied to the area above the eye, which is a peripheral area. It is not a central pain stimulus because it does not originate from the CNS.\n\nB. **Pressure on the little finger pulp**: This pressure is applied to the area of the little finger, which is also a peripheral area. It is not a central pain stimulus because it does not originate from the CNS.\n\nC. **Trapezius squeeze**: This squeeze is applied to the trapezius muscle, which is a peripheral area. It is not a central pain stimulus because it does not originate from the CNS.\n\nD. **Sternal rub**: This rub is applied to the sternum, which is a central area. It is a central pain stimulus because it originates from the CNS.\n\nBased on this analysis, the manoeuvres that are not central painful stimuli are:\n\n- A. Supra-orbital ridge pressure.\n- B. Pressure on the little finger pulp.\n- C. Trapezius squeeze.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A, B, and C.",
