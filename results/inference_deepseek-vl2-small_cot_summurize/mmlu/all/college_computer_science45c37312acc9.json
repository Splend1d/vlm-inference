Consider a graph with an even number of vertices and an odd number of edges. The sum of the degrees of all vertices would be even, but the graph would not be connected.\n\nII. |E| \u2265 |V| \u2212 1\n\nThis statement is true. In a connected graph, the number of edges is always greater than or equal to the number of vertices minus one.\n\nIII. G has at least one vertex with degree 1.\n\nThis statement is not necessarily true. A graph can have all vertices with degree 2 or more.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. II only.",
