            "content": "To determine which number written in exponential notation is equivalent to 343, we need to find the exponent that gives us 343 when 3 is raised to that power.\n\nWe know that \\(3^5 = 243\\) and \\(3^6 = 729\\). Since 343 is between 243 and 729, we can conclude that the exponent must be between 5 and 6.\n\nThe only option that fits this range is \\(3^6\\), which is equal to 729. However, we are looking for the equivalent expression, and \\(3^6\\) is not the correct answer.\n\nLet's re-examine the options:\n\nA. \\(3^7 = 2187\\)\nB. \\(7^3 = 343\\)\nC. \\(7^49\\)\nD. \\(294^49\\)\n\nWe can see that option B, \\(7^3\\), is the correct answer, as it is equal to 343.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\\[ B \\]",
