Due to the limitations in representing certain numbers exactly, operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division can result in different outcomes depending on the order of operations. This nonassociativity arises because the exact representation of some numbers is not possible, leading to different results when the same operations are performed in different orders.\n\nB. **It is inherently nonassociative because there have to be upper and lower bounds on the size of numbers.**\n\n   While the size of floating-point numbers is limited, this does not inherently cause nonassociativity. The nonassociativity is due to the inability to represent certain numbers exactly, not the size limitations. The size limitations ensure that operations are performed within a manageable range, but they do not affect the associativity of operations.\n\nC. **Associativity can be achieved with appropriate roundoff conventions.**\n\n   This statement is true. In practice, floating-point arithmetic can be made associative by using specific rounding conventions. For example, the IEEE 754 standard provides rules for rounding numbers to ensure that the order of operations does not affect the result.\n\nD. **Some rational numbers have no exact representation.**\n\n   This statement is true. Rational numbers can be expressed as fractions, and some of these fractions cannot be exactly represented in floating-point format due to the limitations of the number of bits used to represent the fraction.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that is NOT true is:\n\nB. It is inherently nonassociative because there have to be upper and lower bounds on the size of numbers.",
