Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **First, perform the multiplication inside the parentheses:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 8 = 48\n   \\]\n\n2. **Next, multiply the result by 12:**\n   \\[\n   48 \\times 12 = 576\n   \\]\n\nSo, the expression (6 \u00d7 8) \u00d7 12 evaluates to 576.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **6 + (8 + 12)**\n   - This expression adds 6 to the sum of 8 and 12.\n   - Calculation: \\(6 + (8 + 12) = 6 + 20 = 26\\)\n   - This is not equal to 576.\n\nB. **6 + (8 \u00d7 12)**\n   - This expression adds 6 to the product of 8 and 12.\n   - Calculation: \\(6 + (8 \\times 12) = 6 + 96 = 102\\)\n   - This is not equal to 576.\n\nC. **6 \u00d7 (8 + 12)**\n   - This expression multiplies 6 by the sum of 8 and 12.\n   - Calculation: \\(6 \\times (8 + 12) = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\)\n   - This is not equal to 576.\n\nD. **6 \u00d7 (8 \u00d7 12)**\n   - This expression multiplies 6 by the product of 8 and 12.\n   - Calculation: \\(6 \\times (8 \\times 12) = 6 \\times 96 = 576\\)\n   - This is equal to 576.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 6 \u00d7 (8 \u00d7 12).",
