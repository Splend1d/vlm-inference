            "content": "Let's analyze each option to determine which statement is true about headaches:\n\nA. When associated with neck stiffness is always due to meningitis\n- Meningitis is an inflammation of the protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. While neck stiffness can be a symptom of meningitis, it is not the only cause. Other conditions, such as a viral infection or a reaction to a vaccine, can also cause neck stiffness. Therefore, this statement is not always true.\n\nB. Severe pain usually indicates a life-threatening cause\n- Severe pain can be a symptom of various conditions, but not all severe pain indicates a life-threatening cause. For example, severe headaches can be caused by tension headaches, migraines, or other non-life-threatening conditions. Thus, this statement is not universally true.\n\nC. Temporal arteritis is strongly associated with rheumatoid arthritis\n- Temporal arteritis is a condition that involves inflammation of the temporal arteries, which can lead to severe headaches. It is not strongly associated with rheumatoid arthritis, although it can occur in some cases. Therefore, this statement is not accurate.\n\nD. Tension headaches is a common cause of headache\n- Tension headaches are the most common type of headache, accounting for about 90% of all headache cases. They are often caused by stress, muscle tension, or poor posture. This statement is true.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is D. Tension headaches is a common cause of headache.",
