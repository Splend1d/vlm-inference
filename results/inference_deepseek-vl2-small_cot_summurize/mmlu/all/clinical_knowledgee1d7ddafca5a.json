When you can no longer hear the Korotkoff sounds because the bladder is equal with the diastolic pressure.\n- This statement is incorrect. The Korotkoff sounds disappear when the cuff is fully deflated, not when the bladder is equal with the diastolic pressure.\n\nB. When the Korotkoff sounds can be heard between systolic and diastolic phases.\n- This statement is incorrect. The Korotkoff sounds are heard during the inflation phase, not between systolic and diastolic phases.\n\nC. When the Korotkoff sounds disappear then return during phase 2 as the bladder is deflated.\n- This statement is incorrect. The Korotkoff sounds disappear when the cuff is fully deflated, not during phase 2.\n\nD. When the Korotkoff sounds do not disappear when the cuff is fully deflated.\n- This statement is correct. The Korotkoff sounds do not disappear when the cuff is fully deflated, indicating that the cuff pressure is higher than the systolic pressure.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. When the Korotkoff sounds do not disappear when the cuff is fully deflated.",
