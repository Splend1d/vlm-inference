            "content": "To determine which option best describes a fixed action pattern, let's analyze each choice:\n\nA. **Occurs the second time an animal is exposed to the correct stimulus at the appropriate time in its life**: This option suggests that a fixed action pattern is a learned behavior that occurs only after a specific number of exposures. However, fixed action patterns are innate behaviors that are present from birth and do not require learning. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\nB. **Occurs in the absence of sensory feedback**: Fixed action patterns are not dependent on sensory feedback. They are automatic responses that are triggered by specific stimuli and are executed without the need for sensory input. This option is incorrect.\n\nC. **Is a motor response which once released may be terminated spontaneously**: This option describes a motor response, but it does not specifically refer to a fixed action pattern. A motor response is a general term for any movement or action, whereas a fixed action pattern is a specific type of behavior. This option is incorrect.\n\nD. **Is triggered by a number of sensory signals in the animal's environment**: This option accurately describes a fixed action pattern. Fixed action patterns are innate behaviors that are triggered by specific stimuli in the animal's environment. They are not learned and are executed automatically, often involving a combination of sensory inputs.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. A fixed action pattern is triggered by a number of sensory signals in the animal's environment.",
