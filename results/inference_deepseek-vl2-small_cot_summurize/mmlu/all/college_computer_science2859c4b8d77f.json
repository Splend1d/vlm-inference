They produce an output based on the current input values and do not retain any information from previous inputs.\n- Sequential circuits, on the other hand, can have feedback. They can maintain and use information from previous inputs, which is a key characteristic of sequential circuits.\n- Therefore, statement I is false.\n\nII. Combinational circuits have a \"memoryless\" property; sequential circuits do not.\n- Combinational circuits do not have a \"memoryless\" property. They do not retain any information from previous inputs.\n- Sequential circuits do have a \"memoryless\" property. They do not retain information from previous inputs, but they can maintain and use information from previous inputs based on the current input values.\n- Therefore, statement II is false.\n\nIII. Both sequential and combinational circuits must be controlled by an external clock.\n- Sequential circuits are controlled by an external clock. The clock signal determines the timing of the circuit's operations.\n- Combinational circuits do not require an external clock. They operate based on the current input values and do not depend on a clock signal.\n- Therefore, statement III is false.\n\nNone of the statements are true. The correct answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{A}$",
