            "content": "To determine which option represents a combination of contractionary fiscal and expansionary monetary policy, we need to understand the definitions of each policy:\n\n1. **Fiscal Policy**: This involves government spending and taxation. Expansionary fiscal policy typically includes increasing government spending or decreasing taxes to stimulate economic growth.\n\n2. **Monetary Policy**: This involves the actions of a central bank to control the money supply and interest rates. Expansionary monetary policy usually includes lowering interest rates and increasing the money supply to stimulate economic growth.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Higher taxes \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Selling Treasury securities**\n   - Higher taxes are contractionary fiscal policy because they reduce disposable income and spending.\n   - Selling Treasury securities is expansionary monetary policy because it increases the money supply and lowers interest rates.\n   - This option does not represent a combination of both policies.\n\nB. **Lower taxes \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Buying Treasury securities**\n   - Lower taxes are expansionary fiscal policy because they increase disposable income and spending.\n   - Buying Treasury securities is expansionary monetary policy because it increases the money supply and lowers interest rates.\n   - This option does not represent a combination of both policies.\n\nC. **Lower government spending \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Increasing the reserve ratio**\n   - Lower government spending is contractionary fiscal policy because it reduces demand in the economy.\n   - Increasing the reserve ratio is contractionary monetary policy because it reduces the money supply and increases interest rates.\n   - This option does not represent a combination of both policies.\n\nD. **Higher taxes \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Buying Treasury securities**\n   - Higher taxes are contractionary fiscal policy because they reduce disposable income and spending.\n   - Buying Treasury securities is expansionary monetary policy because it increases the money supply and lowers interest rates.\n   - This option represents a combination of contractionary fiscal and expansionary monetary policy.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **D. Higher taxes \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Buying Treasury securities**.",
