            "content": "To determine which option best explains the benefits of drinking breast milk, let's analyze each choice:\n\nA. Breast milk contains vitamins that repair mutations originating in the sperm or egg.\n- This statement is incorrect. Breast milk does not contain vitamins that repair mutations. Vitamin repair is not a function of breast milk.\n\nB. Breast milk contains maternal antibodies that protect against gastrointestinal pathogens.\n- This statement is correct. Breast milk contains antibodies that are transferred from the mother to the infant. These antibodies provide passive immunity, protecting the infant from infections and diseases, particularly gastrointestinal pathogens.\n\nC. Breast milk contains maternal vaccines that destroy common childhood pathogens.\n- This statement is incorrect. Breast milk does not contain vaccines. Vaccines are administered to infants to stimulate their immune system to fight off diseases, not to be consumed.\n\nD. Breast milk contains red blood cells with adult hemoglobin that are beneficial to the infant's developing brain.\n- This statement is incorrect. While breast milk does contain red blood cells, they do not contain adult hemoglobin. The presence of red blood cells in breast milk is not beneficial for brain development.\n\nAfter evaluating each option, the correct answer is B. Breast milk contains maternal antibodies that protect against gastrointestinal pathogens. This is the primary reason why drinking breast milk is beneficial to a human infant.",
