Neon has a lower melting point than argon.\n\nB. **Boiling point**: Argon has a boiling point of -185.85\u00b0C, whereas neon has a boiling point of -246.05\u00b0C. Neon has a lower boiling point than argon.\n\nC. **Polarizability**: Polarizability is a measure of how easily the electron cloud of an atom can be distorted by an external electric field. Argon has a higher polarizability than neon because it has a larger electron cloud.\n\nD. **First ionization energy**: First ionization energy is the energy required to remove the outermost electron from an atom. Argon has a higher first ionization energy than neon because it has a larger atomic radius and a higher effective nuclear charge.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the properties that are lower for argon than for neon are:\n\n- **Melting point**\n- **Boiling point**\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Melting point\nB. Boiling point",
