            "content": "To determine which factor most likely affects the gene pool of the newly established bird population, we need to understand the mechanisms of genetic change:\n\nA. **Directed mutation**: This refers to mutations that are specifically beneficial or harmful to the organism. While directed mutations can occur, they are not the primary mechanism that shapes the gene pool of a newly established population.\n\nB. **Genetic drift**: This is a random change in the frequency of alleles in a population. In small populations, genetic drift can have a significant impact because it introduces random changes in allele frequencies, potentially leading to the loss of genetic variation.\n\nC. **Adaptive radiation**: This is a process where a single species rapidly diversifies into multiple new species, each adapted to a different ecological niche. While adaptive radiation can occur, it is not the immediate effect of a hurricane-induced population shift.\n\nD. **Disruptive selection**: This occurs when a new environment introduces a new set of selective pressures that favor certain traits over others. While disruptive selection can affect a population, it is not the primary mechanism that shapes the gene pool immediately after a population is established on a new island.\n\nGiven these explanations, the most likely immediate effect on the gene pool of the newly established bird population is **genetic drift**. This is because the small size of the population and the isolation of the island make it susceptible to random changes in allele frequencies, which can lead to a loss of genetic diversity.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. Genetic drift**.",
