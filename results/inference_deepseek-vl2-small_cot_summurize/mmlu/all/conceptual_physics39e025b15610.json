This is a process of electron transfer, where electrons are transferred from one atom or molecule to another.\n\n2. **Charge of Electrons**: Electrons are negatively charged particles. When you remove electrons from your hair, you are effectively removing negatively charged particles.\n\n3. **Resulting Charge**: Since electrons are negatively charged, the removal of electrons from your hair results in a net negative charge on the hair.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Therefore, after brushing your hair and scraping electrons from it, the charge of your hair becomes negative.\n\nThus, the correct answer is B. negative.",
