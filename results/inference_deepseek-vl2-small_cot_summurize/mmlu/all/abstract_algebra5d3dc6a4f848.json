            "content": "To find the inverse of \\(a\\) in the group \\((Z, *)\\) where \\(a * b = a + b + 1\\), we need to find an element \\(b\\) such that \\(a * b = 1\\), where \\(1\\) is the identity element in the group.\n\nGiven \\(a * b = a + b + 1\\), we want to find \\(b\\) such that:\n\\[a + b + 1 = 1\\]\n\nSolving for \\(b\\):\n\\[b = 1 - a\\]\n\nHowever, since \\(b\\) must be an integer (as it is in the set of integers \\(Z\\)), and \\(1 - a\\) must also be an integer, we need to ensure that \\(1 - a\\) is an integer. This is only possible if \\(a\\) is an integer.\n\nLet's check the options:\n\nA. \\(0\\): If \\(a = 0\\), then \\(b = 1 - 0 = 1\\). This works because \\(0 * 1 = 0 + 1 + 1 = 2\\), and \\(2 * 1 = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4\\), which is not equal to \\(1\\). So, \\(0\\) is not the inverse of \\(0\\).\n\nB. \\(-2\\): If \\(a = -2\\), then \\(b = 1 - (-2) = 1 + 2 = 3\\). This works because \\(-2 * 3 = -2 + 3 + 1 = 2\\), and \\(2 * 3 = 2 + 3 + 1 = 6\\), which is not equal to \\(1\\). So, \\(-2\\) is not the inverse of \\(-2\\).\n\nC. \\(a - 2\\): If \\(a = -2\\), then \\(b = -2 - 2 = -4\\). This works because \\(-2 * (-4) = -2 + (-4) + 1 = -5\\), and \\(-5 * (-4) = -5 + (-4) + 1 = -8\\), which is not equal to \\(1\\). So, \\(a - 2\\) is not the inverse of \\(-2\\).\n\nD. \\((2 + a) * -1\\): If \\(a = -2\\), then \\((2 + (-2)) * -1 = 0 * -1 = 0\\). This works because \\(0 * -1 = 0 + (-1) + 1 = 0\\), and \\(0 * 0 = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1\\). So, \\((2 + a) * -1\\) is the inverse of \\(-2\\).\n\nTherefore, the inverse of \\(a\\) in the group \\((Z, *)\\) where \\(a * b = a + b + 1\\) is \\((2 + a) * -1\\).\n\nThe correct answer is:\nD. \\((2 + a) * -1\\)",
