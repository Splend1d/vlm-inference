Eyespot: An eyespot is a simple structure found in some animals, such as certain fish and amphibians, that contains a single photoreceptor cell. It is not a complex structure like the ommatidia found in crustaceans and insects.\n\nB. Simple eye: A simple eye is a basic visual organ found in some animals, such as the eyes of certain fish and invertebrates. It contains a single lens and a single photoreceptor cell. It is not composed of multiple ommatidia.\n\nC. Compound eye: A compound eye is a type of visual organ found in arthropods, such as insects, crustaceans, and arachnids. It is made up of numerous ommatidia, each of which contains a photoreceptor cell and a lens. The ommatidia are arranged in a grid-like pattern, and the collective function of these ommatidia allows for the detection of movement and the perception of a wide field of view.\n\nD. Binocular eye: A binocular eye is a type of visual organ found in some animals, such as humans and certain birds, that consists of two eyes positioned side by side. It is not composed of ommatidia.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is C. compound eye, as it is the only option that describes a visual organ made up of multiple ommatidia.",
