This connection allows for the equalization of air pressure on both sides of the eardrum, which is crucial for proper hearing and balance.\n\nB. **is derived from the second pharyngeal pouch.**\n   - The auditory tube is derived from the first pharyngeal pouch, not the second. The first pharyngeal pouch is the most prominent and forms the majority of the tube.\n\nC. **is opened by the action of levator veli palatini.**\n   - The levator veli palatini muscle is responsible for elevating the soft palate, which helps in closing the auditory tube. It does not open it.\n\nD. **is closed by the action of tensor veli palatini.**\n   - The tensor veli palatini muscle is involved in lowering the soft palate, which aids in closing the auditory tube. It does not open it.\n\nAfter evaluating each option, the correct answer is:\n\nA. connects the inner ear and nasopharynx.",
