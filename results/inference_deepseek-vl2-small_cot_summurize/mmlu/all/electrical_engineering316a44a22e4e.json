Tachometer - A tachometer is a device used to measure the rotational speed of a rotating shaft. It is not a variable displacement transducer.\n\nB. Potentiometer - A potentiometer is a variable resistor used to measure or control voltage or current. It is not a variable displacement transducer.\n\nC. Synchros - Synchros are devices used to measure the angle or position of a rotating shaft. They are variable displacement transducers.\n\nD. None of the above - This option is incorrect because there is a correct answer.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Synchros.",
