These atoms have lone pairs of electrons that can form hydrogen bonds with hydrogen atoms in other molecules.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. CH3OCH2CH3 (Ethyl methyl ether)\n- This compound consists of an oxygen atom bonded to two carbon atoms and a hydrogen atom. The oxygen atom has lone pairs of electrons, but the hydrogen atom is not bonded to a highly electronegative atom like nitrogen, fluorine, or oxygen. Therefore, it cannot form hydrogen bonds.\n\nB. HCN (Hydrogen cyanide)\n- This compound contains a hydrogen atom bonded to a carbon atom, which is further bonded to a nitrogen atom. The nitrogen atom has a lone pair of electrons, allowing it to form hydrogen bonds with hydrogen atoms in other molecules.\n\nC. CH3OCH2Br (Ethyl methyl bromide)\n- This compound has an oxygen atom bonded to two carbon atoms and a hydrogen atom. The oxygen atom has lone pairs of electrons, but the hydrogen atom is not bonded to a highly electronegative atom like nitrogen, fluorine, or oxygen. Therefore, it cannot form hydrogen bonds.\n\nD. CH3NH2 (Methylamine)\n- This compound contains a nitrogen atom bonded to three hydrogen atoms. The nitrogen atom has a lone pair of electrons, allowing it to form hydrogen bonds with hydrogen atoms in other molecules.\n\nBased on the analysis, the compounds that can form hydrogen bonds are:\n\nB. HCN\nD. CH3NH2",
