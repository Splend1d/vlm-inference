It is not cartilaginous but is a bone that serves as an attachment point for muscles and ligaments.\n\n2. **Thyroid Cartilage**: The thyroid cartilage is the largest of the cartilaginous structures in the neck. It is located below the hyoid bone and is the first structure you will encounter when palpating the anterior midline.\n\n3. **Cricoid Cartilage**: The cricoid cartilage is a smaller, ring-shaped structure located below the thyroid cartilage. It is the third structure you will encounter when palpating the anterior midline.\n\nGiven this anatomical sequence, the correct order from chin to sternal notch is:\n\n- **Hyoid Bone**\n- **Thyroid Cartilage**\n- **Cricoid Cartilage**\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. hyoid bone, thyroid cartilage, cricoid cartilage.",
