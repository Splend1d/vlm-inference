            "content": "To determine the correct statement, let's analyze the situation step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Defect**: A ventricular septal defect (VSD) is a hole in the septum that separates the right and left ventricles. This defect allows blood to flow from the right ventricle to the left ventricle, bypassing the lungs.\n\n2. **Impact on Blood Oxygenation**: Normally, blood is oxygenated in the lungs. When a VSD exists, blood bypasses the lungs and goes directly to the left ventricle, which is then pumped to the rest of the body. This means that the left ventricle receives oxygen-rich blood from the right ventricle, which is oxygen-poor.\n\n3. **Oxygen Percentage in the Left Atrium**: Since the left ventricle receives oxygen-rich blood from the right ventricle, the oxygen percentage in the left atrium would be higher than it would be if the blood were oxygenated in the lungs.\n\n4. **Oxygen Percentage in the Right Ventricle**: Conversely, the right ventricle receives oxygen-poor blood from the right atrium, which is then pumped to the lungs for oxygenation. Therefore, the oxygen percentage in the right ventricle would be lower than it would be if the blood were oxygenated in the lungs.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Based on this analysis, the correct statement is:\n\n   **A. The percentage of oxygen in the left atrium would be lower.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. The correct statement is that the percentage of oxygen in the left atrium would be higher.",
