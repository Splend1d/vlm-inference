They are not involved in mucus production and are not located on the sides of the vaginal opening.\n\nB. **Bartholin's**: The Bartholin's glands are located on each side of the vaginal opening. They are responsible for producing mucus to lubricate the vaginal opening, which is essential for sexual intercourse and childbirth. These glands are crucial for maintaining vaginal health and comfort.\n\nC. **Bulbourethral**: The bulbourethral glands, also known as Cowper's glands, are located at the base of the penis and the entrance of the urethra. They produce a clear, slippery fluid that helps lubricate the urethra and the entrance of the penis. These glands are not located on the sides of the vaginal opening.\n\nD. **Corpus luteum**: The corpus luteum is a temporary endocrine structure that forms in the ovary after ovulation. It is involved in the production of progesterone and is not related to mucus production or location on the vaginal opening.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the correct answer is **B. Bartholin's**. These glands are the mucus-producing glands located on each side of the vaginal opening.",
