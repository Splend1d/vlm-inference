This is due to limited processing power. The system may not have enough CPU (Central Processing Unit) or memory (RAM) to handle the large volume of data efficiently, leading to a crash.\n\nA. buffer: A buffer is a temporary storage area used to hold data while it is being transferred from one place to another. While a buffer can help manage data flow, it is not the primary cause of the system crashing when inserting too many words.\n\nB. external storage: External storage refers to devices like hard drives or solid-state drives that store data. The system crashing is not due to limited external storage because the search box is not accessing external storage.\n\nD. local storage: Local storage refers to the storage space available on the device itself, such as the hard drive or solid-state drive. While limited local storage can cause issues, the primary cause of the system crashing in this scenario is the processing power, not the local storage.",
