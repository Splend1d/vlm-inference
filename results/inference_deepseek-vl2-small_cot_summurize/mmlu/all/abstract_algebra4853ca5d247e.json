This is a fundamental property of groups.\n- If \\( a \\neq b \\), then \\( a^2 \\) and \\( b^2 \\) are distinct elements in the group.\n- Therefore, \\( a^2 \\neq b^2 \\) is true.\n\n**Statement 2:** The set of rotations in a dihedral group form a cyclic subgroup.\n\n- A dihedral group \\( D_n \\) consists of all symmetries of a regular \\( n \\)-gon, including rotations and reflections.\n- The set of rotations in \\( D_n \\) forms a subgroup of \\( D_n \\).\n- However, this set is not cyclic because it does not generate the entire group \\( D_n \\).\n- A cyclic subgroup is one that can be generated by a single element.\n- Therefore, the set of rotations in a dihedral group does not form a cyclic subgroup.\n\nGiven the evaluations:\n- Statement 1 is true.\n- Statement 2 is false.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{C}\n\\]",
