            "content": "To determine the number of questions Mary needs to ask Bob to identify the number between 1 and 1,000, we can use a binary search strategy. This strategy involves asking yes/no questions that help narrow down the possible range of numbers.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of the process:\n\n1. **Initial Range**: Start with the entire range of numbers from 1 to 1,000.\n\n2. **First Question**: Ask Bob if the number is less than 500.\n   - If Bob says \"yes\", the number must be less than 500.\n   - If Bob says \"no\", the number must be 500 or more.\n\n3. **Second Question**: Based on the first question's answer, narrow the range to either 1 to 499 or 501 to 1,000.\n   - If the number is less than 500, ask Bob if it is less than 250.\n   - If the number is 500 or more, ask Bob if it is less than 500.\n\n4. **Third Question**: Based on the second question's answer, further narrow the range.\n   - If the number is less than 250, ask Bob if it is less than 125.\n   - If the number is 250 or more, ask Bob if it is less than 250.\n\n5. **Fourth Question**: Based on the third question's answer, narrow the range to either 1 to 124 or 126 to 249.\n   - If the number is less than 125, ask Bob if it is less than 62.\n   - If the number is 126 or more, ask Bob if it is less than 125.\n\n6. **Fifth Question**: Based on the fourth question's answer, further narrow the range.\n   - If the number is less than 62, ask Bob if it is less than 31.\n   - If the number is 62 or more, ask Bob if it is less than 62.\n\n7. **Sixth Question**: Based on the fifth question's answer, narrow the range to either 1 to 30 or 32 to 61.\n   - If the number is less than 31, ask Bob if it is less than 15.\n   - If the number is 32 or more, ask Bob if it is less than 31.\n\n8. **Seventh Question**: Based on the sixth question's answer, further narrow the range.\n   - If the number is less than 15, ask Bob if it is less than 7.\n   - If the number is 15 or more, ask Bob if it is less than 15.\n\n9. **Eighth Question**: Based on the seventh question's answer, narrow the range to either 1 to 6 or 7 to 14.\n   - If the number is less than 7, ask Bob if it is less than 3.\n   - If the number is 7 or more, ask Bob if it is less than 7.\n\n10. **Ninth Question**: Based on the eighth question's answer, further narrow the range.\n    - If the number is less than 3, ask Bob if it is less than 1.\n    - If the number is 3 or more, ask Bob if it is less than 3.\n\n11. **Tenth Question**: Based on the ninth question's answer, narrow the range to either 1 to 1 or 2 to 1.\n    - If the number is less than 1, ask Bob if it is less than 0.5.\n    - If the number is 1 or more, ask Bob if it is less than 1.\n\n12. **Eleventh Question**: Based on the tenth question's answer, further narrow the range.\n    - If the number is less than 0.5, ask Bob if it is less than 0.25.\n    - If the number is 0.5 or more, ask Bob if it is less than 0.5.\n\n13. **Twelfth Question**: Based on the eleventh question's answer, narrow the range to either 1 to 0.25 or 0.26 to 0.5.\n    - If the number is less than 0.25, ask Bob if it is less than 0.125.\n   ",
