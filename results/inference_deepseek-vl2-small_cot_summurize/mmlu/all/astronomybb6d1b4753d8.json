            "content": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option based on the Solar Nebular theory:\n\nA. They are the shattered remains of collisions between planets.\n- This option suggests that asteroids and comets are remnants of planetary collisions. However, the Solar Nebular theory primarily focuses on the formation of planets and moons from a disk of gas and dust. It does not specifically address collisions between planets as a primary mechanism for forming asteroids and comets.\n\nB. They are chunks of rock or ice that condensed long after the planets and moons had formed.\n- This option aligns with the Solar Nebular theory. According to this theory, asteroids and comets are formed from the leftover material that did not coalesce into planets or moons. This material, known as planetesimals, includes both rock and ice. Over time, these planetesimals accumulated and eventually formed the asteroid belt and the Kuiper Belt, where comets are found.\n\nC. They are chunks of rock or ice that were expelled from planets by volcanoes.\n- This option is incorrect. Volcanic activity is not a significant process for forming asteroids and comets. Volcanoes are associated with planetary interiors and do not contribute to the formation of these celestial bodies.\n\nD. They are leftover planetesimals that never accreted into planets.\n- This option is partially correct but not as comprehensive as option B. While it acknowledges that asteroids and comets are leftover planetesimals, it does not specifically mention the role of ice in their formation.\n\nAfter evaluating each option, the most accurate description of asteroids and comets according to the Solar Nebular theory is:\n\nB. They are chunks of rock or ice that condensed long after the planets and moons had formed.",
