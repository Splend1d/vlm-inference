In this case, 46% of the loci are heterozygous.\n\n2. **Understanding Homozygosity**: Homozygosity refers to the presence of two identical alleles at a particular locus. The complement of heterozygosity is homozygosity.\n\n3. **Calculating Homozygosity**: Since 46% of the loci are heterozygous, the remaining 54% must be homozygous (because the total must add up to 100%).\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the average homozygosity of the species is 54%.\n\nThus, the correct answer is C. 54%.",
