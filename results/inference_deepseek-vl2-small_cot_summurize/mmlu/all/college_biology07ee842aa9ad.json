They are crucial for cell movement as they help cells adhere to the extracellular matrix and facilitate the transition from one cell to another.\n\nB. **Vinculin**: This is a cytoskeletal protein that plays a significant role in cell adhesion and motility. Vinculin helps in the formation of focal adhesions, which are essential for cell movement and stability.\n\nC. **Clathrin**: Clathrin is a protein complex involved in the endocytosis process, where cells internalize materials from their external environment. It is not directly involved in cell motility.\n\nD. **Lamellipodia**: These are actin-rich protrusions at the leading edge of cells that help in cell movement. They are crucial for processes such as chemotaxis and wound healing.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Clathrin\n\nClathrin is not involved in cell motility. It is primarily associated with endocytosis, a process where cells internalize substances from their external environment.",
