            "content": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Each packet contains data to be transmitted, along with metadata containing information used for routing the data.\n- This option is correct. In the Internet, data is typically transmitted in packets. Each packet includes the actual data being sent and metadata that helps in routing the packet through the network. The metadata often contains information such as the source and destination IP addresses, port numbers, and sequence numbers, which are crucial for ensuring the data reaches its intended destination.\n\nB. Each packet contains an encrypted version of the data to be transmitted, along with metadata containing the key needed to decrypt the data.\n- This option is incorrect. While encryption is a common practice to protect data during transmission, it is not the standard method for assembling packets. Encryption is applied to the data itself, not to the packets.\n\nC. Each packet contains only the metadata used to establish a direct connection so that the data can be transmitted.\n- This option is incorrect. While metadata is essential for establishing a connection, it is not the only component of a packet. A packet must also contain the actual data being transmitted.\n\nD. Each packet contains multiple data files bundled together, along with metadata describing how to categorize each data file.\n- This option is incorrect. While it is possible to bundle multiple files into a single packet, this is not a standard method of packet assembly. The focus is on the data and metadata, not on categorizing files.\n\nTherefore, the best explanation for how data is typically assembled in packets for transmission over the Internet is option A.",
