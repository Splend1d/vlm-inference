The complement of S in R^2 is the set of all points (x, y) in R^2 for which both x and y are rational. This set is a subset of the unit square [0, 1] \u00d7 [0, 1], and it is closed in the standard topology on R^2.\n\n2. **Open Sets**: A set is open if its complement is closed. The complement of S in R^2 is the set of all points (x, y) in R^2 for which both x and y are rational. This set is closed in the standard topology on R^2, so its complement is open.\n\n3. **Connected Sets**: A set is connected if it cannot be written as the union of two disjoint non-empty open sets. The complement of S in R^2 is the set of all points (x, y) in R^2 for which both x and y are rational. This set is closed in the standard topology on R^2, and it is not the union of two disjoint non-empty open sets. Therefore, S is not connected.\n\n4. **Totally Disconnected Sets**: A set is totally disconnected if it cannot be written as the union of two disjoint non-empty open sets. The complement of S in R^2 is the set of all points (x, y) in R^2 for which both x and y are rational. This set is closed in the standard topology on R^2, and it is not the union of two disjoint non-empty open sets. Therefore, S is not totally disconnected.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nC. connected",
