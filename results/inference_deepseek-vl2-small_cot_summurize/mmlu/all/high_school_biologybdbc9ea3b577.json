            "content": "To determine which factors contribute to the resting membrane potential, we need to understand the mechanisms involved in maintaining this potential.\n\n1. **Active Transport (I)**: This process involves the movement of ions across the membrane against their concentration gradients, using energy. It is crucial for maintaining ion balance and is a key component of the resting membrane potential. For instance, the sodium-potassium pump actively transports sodium ions out of the cell and potassium ions into the cell, which is essential for maintaining the negative charge inside the cell relative to the outside.\n\n2. **Selective Permeability (II)**: This refers to the ability of the membrane to allow certain ions to pass through while blocking others. The resting membrane potential is largely maintained by the selective permeability of the membrane, which allows potassium ions to exit the cell more easily than sodium ions can enter. This difference in permeability is crucial for the negative resting membrane potential.\n\n3. **Differential Distribution of Ions (III)**: This involves the uneven distribution of ions across the membrane, which is a result of the selective permeability and active transport processes. The distribution of ions like sodium, potassium, and chloride contributes to the resting membrane potential.\n\nGiven this analysis, the resting membrane potential is influenced by all three factors: active transport, selective permeability, and the differential distribution of ions. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. I, II, and III",
