Her spirit will be seen through the whole establishment; and just in proportion as she performs her duties intelligently and thoroughly, so will her domestics follow in her path. Of all of those acquirements, which more particularly belong to the feminine character, there are none which take a higher rank, in our estimation, than such as enter into a knowledge of household duties; for on these are perpetually dependent the happiness, comfort, and well-being of the family.\nIsabella Beeton, Book of Household Management, 1861\nFrom the passage, one may infer that Beeton believed that\n\nA. women held considerable power and responsibility in the public sphere of social life\nB. women were denied power and responsibility in the public sphere of social life\nC. women held considerable power and responsibility within the domestic sphere of social life\nD. women were denied power and responsibility within the domestic sphere of social life\n",

She suggests that the mistress's spirit and performance of her duties will influence the entire household, and that her knowledge of household duties is of the highest rank among feminine acquirements. This implies that Beeton believed women held considerable power and responsibility within the domestic sphere of social life.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. women held considerable power and responsibility within the domestic sphere of social life.\n\nSo, the final answer is $\\boxed{C}$.",
