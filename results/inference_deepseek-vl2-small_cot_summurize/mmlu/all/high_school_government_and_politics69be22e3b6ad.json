            "content": "To determine which option best describes the balance the Supreme Court has struck between the establishment clause and the free-exercise clause, we need to understand the principles of these clauses and how they apply to different scenarios.\n\nThe Establishment Clause of the First Amendment prohibits the government from establishing a religion or favoring one religion over another. The Free Exercise Clause ensures that individuals have the right to practice their religion freely.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Freedom of speech is protected except in certain situations, such as yelling \"fire\" in a crowded theater.\n- This option refers to the First Amendment's protection of free speech, not the Establishment Clause or the Free Exercise Clause. It does not address the balance between these two clauses.\n\nB. Once a church has been recognized by the federal government, its tax-exempt status can never be revoked.\n- This option relates to the tax-exempt status of religious organizations, which is not directly related to the Establishment Clause or the Free Exercise Clause.\n\nC. Once Congress has created an administrative agency, that agency can be dissolved only by a constitutional amendment.\n- This option deals with the structure of government agencies, not the Establishment Clause or the Free Exercise Clause.\n\nD. State-sponsored prayer during school hours is prohibited, but voluntary prayer by student groups before school is allowed.\n- This option directly addresses the balance between the Establishment Clause and the Free Exercise Clause. The Establishment Clause prohibits the government from promoting a particular religion, while the Free Exercise Clause allows individuals to practice their religion freely. The scenario described respects both clauses by prohibiting state-sponsored prayer (which could be seen as promoting a religion) and allowing voluntary prayer by students (which does not involve government endorsement).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. State-sponsored prayer during school hours is prohibited, but voluntary prayer by student groups before school is allowed. This reflects the Supreme Court's approach to balancing the Establishment Clause and the Free Exercise Clause.",
