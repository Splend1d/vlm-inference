However, they are not the leading cause globally.\n\n2. **Preterm Birth Complications**: While preterm birth is a significant risk factor for mortality, it is not the primary cause of death in children under five.\n\n3. **Diarrheal Diseases**: These are a major cause of death in children under five, particularly in regions with poor sanitation and access to clean water. However, they are not the leading cause globally.\n\n4. **Malaria**: Malaria is a significant cause of death in children under five, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. However, it is not the leading cause globally.\n\nAccording to the WHO, the leading cause of death in children under five years old as of 2017 is **A. Lower Respiratory Infections**. This is due to the high prevalence of respiratory infections, particularly in low-income countries, where access to healthcare and clean water is limited.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **A. Lower Respiratory Infections**.",
