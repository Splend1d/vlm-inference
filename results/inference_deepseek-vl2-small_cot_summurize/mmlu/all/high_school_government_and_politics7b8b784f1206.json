This privilege is granted by the U.S. Constitution, specifically Article I, Section 8, Clause 1, which states that Congress has the power to \"coin Money, regulate the Value thereof, and of foreign Coin, and fix the Standard of Weights and Measures.\" This clause is often interpreted to include the right to send mail at the government's expense.\n\nGerrymandering, pork-barrel legislation, and the Sixteenth Amendment are not related to the franking privilege. Gerrymandering refers to the practice of redrawing electoral district boundaries to favor one political party over another, while pork-barrel legislation refers to the practice of passing legislation that benefits a particular group or region at the expense of the broader public. The Sixteenth Amendment deals with the power of Congress to levy an income tax, not the right to send mail at the government's expense.",
