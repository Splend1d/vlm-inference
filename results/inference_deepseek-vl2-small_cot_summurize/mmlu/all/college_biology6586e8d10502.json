            "content": "To determine which option is NOT a characteristic of introns, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. They occur only in eukaryotes.\n- Introns are indeed found only in eukaryotic organisms. They are absent in prokaryotes, which lack a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles. This is a correct characteristic of introns.\n\nB. They represent noncoding regions.\n- Introns are noncoding regions of DNA. They do not code for proteins but are removed during RNA processing. This is a correct characteristic of introns.\n\nC. They are found interspersed with exons on a region of DNA that codes for a polypeptide chain.\n- This statement is incorrect. Introns are not found interspersed with exons. Instead, they are found interspersed with exons on a region of DNA that does not code for a polypeptide chain. Exons are the coding regions that are joined together to form a functional mRNA.\n\nD. They are excised from the primary transcript before it gains a 5' cap and a 3' poly(A)tail.\n- This is a correct characteristic of introns. During RNA processing, introns are removed from the primary transcript, and exons are joined together. The primary transcript is then modified to include a 5' cap and a 3' poly(A)tail.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, it is clear that option C is the one that does not describe a characteristic of introns. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. They are found interspersed with exons on a region of DNA that codes for a polypeptide chain.",
