            "content": "The Dred Scott decision of 1857 was overturned by the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nThe Fourteenth Amendment, ratified in 1868, was a response to the Dred Scott decision and other Supreme Court rulings that denied citizenship and equal protection under the law to African Americans. The amendment states that \"all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\" This amendment effectively overturned the Dred Scott decision by establishing that African Americans are citizens and entitled to equal protection under the law.\n\nThe other options are not correct:\n\nA. Plessy v. Ferguson decision (1896): This decision upheld racial segregation laws and is often cited as the \"separate but equal\" doctrine, which was later overturned by the Brown v. Board of Education decision in 1954.\n\nB. Missouri Compromise (1820): This was a compromise that admitted Missouri as a slave state and Maine as a free state, but it did not directly address the issue of citizenship for African Americans.\n\nC. Jim Crow laws: These were state and local laws that enforced racial segregation and discrimination in the Southern United States from the late 19th century to the mid-20th century. While they were a significant part of the system of racial oppression in the United States, they were not a direct response to the Dred Scott decision.\n\nD. Fourteenth Amendment: This is the correct answer, as it was the amendment that overturned the Dred Scott decision and established the citizenship and equal protection under the law for African Americans.",
