By providing access to education and community improvement projects, the task force aims to enhance the self-esteem of individuals from different groups.\n\n- **Contact hypothesis (II)**: This hypothesis posits that intergroup contact can lead to reduced prejudice and increased cooperation between groups. The task force's recommendations, including community improvement projects and education, are designed to facilitate such contact and reduce prejudice.\n\n- **Hypothesis (III)**: This is a placeholder for any other relevant hypothesis that might be considered by the task force. While the task force's recommendations are based on the self-esteem and contact hypotheses, they could also be influenced by other hypotheses that are not specified in the question.\n\n- **Legal hypothesis (IV)**: This hypothesis suggests that legal measures can reduce prejudice and hate crimes. The task force's recommendation for stricter anti-hate ordinances is based on this hypothesis, as legal actions can provide a formal and enforceable way to address and reduce hate crimes.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. I, II, and III",
