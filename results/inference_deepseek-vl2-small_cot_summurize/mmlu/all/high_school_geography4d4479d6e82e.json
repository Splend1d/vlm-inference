The first major wave of European settlers in Canada came from France, primarily during the 17th and 18th centuries. These settlers were mainly from the French colony of New France, which included present-day Quebec and parts of Ontario and the Atlantic provinces.\n\nB. Canada's second major migration stream originated in the British Isles.\n- This statement is correct. The second major wave of European settlers in Canada came from the British Isles, particularly from England and Scotland. This migration occurred during the 18th and early 19th centuries, with many settlers moving to the British colonies in North America, including what is now Canada.\n\nC. Canada's third major migration stream came from Latin America.\n- This statement is incorrect. Canada's third major migration stream did not come from Latin America. Instead, the third major wave of European settlers in Canada came from Germany, particularly during the 19th century. This migration was driven by economic opportunities and the desire for a better life, as many Germans settled in the Canadian provinces of Ontario, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan.\n\nD. The first major migration wave to the United States originated in Europe.\n- This statement is correct. The first major wave of European migration to the United States came from Europe, primarily from England, Scotland, and Ireland. This migration occurred during the colonial period, with many settlers moving to the American colonies, which later became the United States.\n\nTherefore, the statement that is NOT correct is:\n\nC. Canada's third major migration stream came from Latin America.",
