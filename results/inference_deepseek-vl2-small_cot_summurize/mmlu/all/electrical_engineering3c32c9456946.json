MSB, Most Significant Bit.\n\nIn the binary number system, the bits are arranged from right to left, with the rightmost bit being the least significant bit (LSB) and the leftmost bit being the most significant bit (MSB). The MSB is the highest place value in the binary number and represents the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to the number.\n\nFor example, in the binary number 1010, the rightmost bit is the LSB, and the leftmost bit is the MSB.\n\nThe other options are incorrect because:\n\nA. LSB, Least Significant Bit - This is the correct term, but it's not the first digit from right to left.\n\nC. First Bit - This is not a standard term in the binary number system.\n\nD. Last Bit - This is not a standard term in the binary number system.\n\nSo, the correct answer is B. MSB, Most Significant Bit.",
