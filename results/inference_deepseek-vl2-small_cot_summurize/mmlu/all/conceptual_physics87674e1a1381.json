            "content": "To determine which property of radiation is lower between terrestrial radiation and radiation from the Sun, we need to understand the characteristics of each type of radiation.\n\n1. **Wavelength**: Terrestrial radiation primarily consists of infrared radiation emitted by the Earth's surface. Infrared radiation has longer wavelengths compared to visible light, which is the type of radiation emitted by the Sun. Therefore, terrestrial radiation has a longer wavelength than the Sun's radiation.\n\n2. **Frequency**: Frequency is the number of wave cycles that pass a point per second. It is inversely proportional to wavelength. Since terrestrial radiation has a longer wavelength, it also has a lower frequency compared to the Sun's radiation, which has shorter wavelengths and thus higher frequencies.\n\n3. **Both**: If both wavelength and frequency were lower for terrestrial radiation, it would imply that it has a shorter wavelength and a lower frequency, which contradicts the known properties of terrestrial radiation.\n\n4. **Neither**: This option would be correct if neither wavelength nor frequency were lower for terrestrial radiation. However, we have established that terrestrial radiation has a longer wavelength and a lower frequency compared to the Sun's radiation.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Both\n\nTerrestrial radiation has both a lower wavelength and a lower frequency compared to the Sun's radiation.",
