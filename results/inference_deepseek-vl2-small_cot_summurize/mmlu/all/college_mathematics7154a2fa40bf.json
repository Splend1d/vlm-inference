In this case, their intersection is the zero subspace, which has dimension 0.\n\nB. 1: This is possible if V and W are parallel (same direction) subspaces. In this case, their intersection is the zero subspace, which has dimension 0.\n\nC. 2: This is possible if V and W are not parallel or orthogonal, but their intersection is a 2-dimensional subspace. For example, if V is a 2-dimensional subspace and W is a 2-dimensional subspace, their intersection can be a 2-dimensional subspace.\n\nD. 3: This is not possible. If V and W are 4-dimensional subspaces, their intersection cannot be a 3-dimensional subspace. The maximum dimension of the intersection is 4 - 4 = 0, which is not equal to 3.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. 3.\n\nThe final answer is: \\(3\\)",
