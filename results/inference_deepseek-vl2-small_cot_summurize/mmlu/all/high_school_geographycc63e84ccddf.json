            "content": "To determine which description best fits the urban hierarchy model where the population of a city is inversely proportional to its rank in the hierarchy, we need to analyze each option:\n\nA. **Multiplier effect**: This concept is related to economic growth and investment, where an initial investment leads to a larger overall economic impact. It does not describe a model of urban hierarchy based on population distribution.\n\nB. **Rank-size rule**: This rule suggests that cities with higher ranks in the hierarchy tend to have larger populations. This is contrary to the given description, where population is inversely proportional to rank.\n\nC. **Central place theory**: This theory, developed by Walter Christaller, describes how cities are organized in a hierarchical structure, with larger cities serving as central places for smaller surrounding areas. It does not specifically address the inverse relationship between population and rank.\n\nD. **Burgess's sector model**: This model, developed by E.W. Burgess, describes urban land use patterns and the spatial distribution of cities. It posits that cities are composed of various sectors, each with a different population density. The model suggests that the population of a city is inversely proportional to its rank in the hierarchy, meaning that the largest city (rank 1) has the smallest population, and the population decreases as the rank increases.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Burgess's sector model\n\nThis model accurately reflects the description provided, where the population of a city is inversely proportional to its rank in the hierarchy.",
