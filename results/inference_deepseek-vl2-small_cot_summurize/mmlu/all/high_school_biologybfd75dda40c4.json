            "content": "To understand the role of the acrosome and cortical reactions, we need to consider the process of fertilization and the subsequent events that occur.\n\n1. **Fertilization Process**: When a sperm cell approaches an ovum, the acrosome, a cap-like structure at the tip of the sperm, releases enzymes. These enzymes are crucial for penetrating the outer layers of the ovum, allowing the sperm to enter and fertilize the egg.\n\n2. **Cortical Reaction**: Once the sperm has entered the ovum, the cortical reaction occurs. This involves the fusion of the sperm's membrane with the ovum's outer membrane, forming a connection between the two cells. This fusion is essential for the transfer of genetic material from the sperm to the egg.\n\n3. **Role of the Acrosome and Cortical Reaction**: The acrosome and cortical reaction are vital for ensuring that only one sperm fertilizes the egg. The acrosome's enzymes prevent other sperm from entering the ovum, while the cortical reaction ensures that the sperm's genetic material is transferred to the egg.\n\n4. **Outcome of the Reactions**: By preventing multiple sperm from fertilizing the egg and ensuring the correct transfer of genetic material, the acrosome and cortical reactions guarantee that the zygote formed will be genetically unique and capable of normal development.\n\nGiven this understanding, the correct answer is:\n\nC. One and only one sperm will fertilize the egg.\n\nThis ensures that the resulting zygote will have the correct genetic makeup for normal development.",
