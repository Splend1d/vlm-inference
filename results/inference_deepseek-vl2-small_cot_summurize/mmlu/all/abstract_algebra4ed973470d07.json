A group is called non-Abelian if the group operation is not commutative, meaning that the order in which elements are multiplied does not matter.\n\nFor \\( n \\geq 3 \\), the symmetric group \\( S_n \\) is non-Abelian. This is because the alternating group \\( A_n \\) (which consists of all even permutations) is a normal subgroup of \\( S_n \\). The quotient group \\( S_n / A_n \\) is non-Abelian, and since \\( A_n \\) is a normal subgroup, \\( S_n \\) is also non-Abelian.\n\nThus, Statement 1 is true.\n\n**Statement 2: If \\( a \\) is a permutation that is an \\( m \\)-cycle and \\( b \\) is a permutation that is an \\( n \\)-cycle, then \\( |ab| = \\text{lcm}(m, n) \\).**\n\nA cycle of length \\( m \\) in a permutation can be written as \\( (a_1 a_2 \\cdots a_m) \\), where \\( a_i \\) is a fixed point. Similarly, a cycle of length \\( n \\) can be written as \\( (b_1 b_2 \\cdots b_n) \\).\n\nThe product \\( ab \\) is a permutation that is a cycle of length \\( m + n \\). The length of the cycle \\( ab \\) is \\( m + n \\).\n\nThe least common multiple (LCM) of \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) is \\( \\text{lcm}(m, n) \\). Therefore, the length of the cycle \\( ab \\) is indeed \\( \\text{lcm}(m, n) \\).\n\nThus, Statement 2 is true.\n\nSince both statements are true, the correct answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{A}\n\\]",
