It is not typically treated with vitamin B-12 injections.\n\nB. **Crohn's disease**: This is a type of inflammatory bowel disease that affects the digestive tract. While vitamin B-12 is important for overall health, it is not specifically used in the treatment of Crohn's disease.\n\nC. **Pernicious anemia**: This is a condition where the body does not absorb vitamin B-12 properly, leading to a deficiency. Vitamin B-12 injections are used to treat pernicious anemia because they provide the necessary vitamin B-12 to the body.\n\nD. **Graves' disease**: This is an autoimmune disorder that causes the thyroid gland to produce excessive amounts of thyroid hormones. It is not treated with vitamin B-12 injections.\n\nAfter evaluating each option, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Pernicious anemia\n\nPernicious anemia is treated with injections of vitamin B-12 because it addresses the underlying deficiency caused by the body's inability to absorb vitamin B-12.",
