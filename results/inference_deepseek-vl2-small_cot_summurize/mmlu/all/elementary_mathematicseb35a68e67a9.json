            "content": "To find the distance between the lowest and highest points on Earth, we need to calculate the difference in elevation between the Mariana Trench and the summit of Mt. Everest.\n\nThe lowest point is at a depth of 35,840 feet below sea level, and the highest point is at a height of 29,028 feet above sea level.\n\nThe difference in elevation is:\n\\[ 35,840 - 29,028 = 6,812 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\nHowever, this is the difference in elevation, not the distance between the two points. To find the distance, we need to consider the curvature of the Earth.\n\nThe Earth's radius is approximately 3,959 miles (6,371 kilometers). The circumference of the Earth is:\n\\[ 2 \\pi r \\approx 2 \\pi (3,959) \\approx 24,566 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nThe distance between the two points is the difference in latitude, which is approximately 180 degrees (from the lowest point to the highest point).\n\nThe distance between the two points is:\n\\[ 180 \\text{ degrees} \\times 3,959 \\text{ miles/degree} \\approx 6,926,200 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nHowever, this is the distance along the Earth's surface, not the distance between the two points. To find the distance between the two points, we need to consider the curvature of the Earth.\n\nThe distance between the two points is approximately:\n\\[ 6,926,200 \\text{ miles} \\times \\frac{1}{3,959} \\approx 1,750,000 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nHowever, this is still not the correct answer. The correct answer is the difference in elevation, which is 6,812 feet.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\\[ 6,812 \\]",
