Surveying the cheerleaders for the home team: Cheerleaders are typically fans of the home team and may not represent the broader fan base. This method is biased towards the home team.\n\nB. Surveying people wearing hats for the visiting team: People wearing hats for the visiting team might be fans, but this method is limited to those who are visibly supporting the visiting team. It may not capture all fans of the visiting team.\n\nC.

Surveying people who do not live in the home team\u2019s city: These individuals may not be fans of the home team and could be from the visiting team's city or neutral fans. This method is not representative of the home team's fan base.\n\nConsidering the representativeness and diversity of the groups surveyed, the most accurate method for determining the most popular football team is:\n\nC.
