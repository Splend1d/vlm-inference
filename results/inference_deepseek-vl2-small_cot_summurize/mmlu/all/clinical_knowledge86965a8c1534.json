            "content": "To determine which products of ADP degradation increase in concentration in the blood during multiple sprint sports, we need to understand the metabolic pathways involved in ADP degradation.\n\n1. **ADP Degradation Pathways**:\n   - **Glycolysis**: ADP is converted into ATP through glycolysis, which does not directly produce any waste products.\n   - **Citric Acid Cycle (Krebs Cycle)**: ATP is produced from ADP through the citric acid cycle, and this process also does not produce waste products.\n   - **Oxidative Phosphorylation**: ATP is produced from ADP through oxidative phosphorylation, which also does not produce waste products.\n\n2. **Alternative Pathways**:\n   - **Anaerobic Glycolysis**: In the absence of oxygen, ADP can be converted into pyruvate, producing lactate (lactic acid) and ammonia.\n   - **Anaerobic Respiration**: This pathway also results in the production of lactate and ammonia.\n\n3. **Products of ADP Degradation**:\n   - **Lactate**: Produced during anaerobic glycolysis and anaerobic respiration.\n   - **Ammonia**: A byproduct of anaerobic metabolism.\n   - **Uric Acid**: A waste product of purine metabolism, which can be produced from the breakdown of nucleic acids.\n\n4. **Context of Multiple Sprint Sports**:\n   - During multiple sprint sports, athletes rely heavily on anaerobic glycolysis and anaerobic respiration due to the short duration and high intensity of the events.\n   - This leads to increased production of lactate and ammonia, as these are the primary products of anaerobic metabolism.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given the metabolic demands of multiple sprint sports, the products of ADP degradation that increase in concentration in the blood are lactate, ammonia, and uric acid.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Ammonia, hypoxanthine and uric acid.",
