            "content": "To determine the fraction of the human genome that encodes proteins, we need to understand the basic structure of the genome and the role of genes.\n\n1. **Genome Overview**: The human genome consists of approximately 3 billion base pairs of DNA. It is organized into 23 pairs of chromosomes, with each chromosome containing a large number of genes.\n\n2. **Role of Genes**: Genes are segments of DNA that contain the instructions for making proteins. Proteins are essential for the structure, function, and regulation of the body's cells, tissues, and organs.\n\n3. **Protein-Encoding Genes**: Only a small fraction of the genome is dedicated to coding for proteins. This is because the vast majority of the genome is non-coding DNA, which does not directly code for proteins.\n\n4. **Estimating the Fraction**: Estimates suggest that only about 1-2% of the human genome is composed of protein-coding genes. This means that the majority of the genome is non-coding, serving other functions such as regulatory sequences, repetitive elements, and structural components.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Given this understanding, the fraction of the human genome that encodes proteins is approximately 1-2%.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 2%",
