Eccrine glands are primarily responsible for producing sweat that helps regulate body temperature through evaporation. Apocrine glands, on the other hand, are involved in the production of a thicker, milky secretion that is often associated with body odor. Both types of glands are crucial for thermoregulation and other functions.\n\nB. **Salivary glands**: These glands produce saliva, which aids in digestion and oral health. They are not related to the functions of eccrine and apocrine glands.\n\nC. **Chemoreceptors**: These are sensory receptors that detect changes in the chemical composition of the blood or other body fluids. They are not related to sweat gland types.\n\nD. **Tear ducts**: These are part of the tear production and drainage system, involved in keeping the eyes moist. They are unrelated to sweat gland types.\n\nAfter evaluating each option, the correct answer is:\n\nA. **Sweat glands**.",
