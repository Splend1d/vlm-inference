            "content": "To determine the empirical formula of the compound, we need to find the simplest whole-number ratio of carbon (C), hydrogen (H), and bromine (Br) atoms in the compound.\n\nGiven percentages:\n- Carbon (C): 51.9%\n- Hydrogen (H): 4.86%\n- Bromine (Br): 43.2%\n\nFirst, convert these percentages to grams:\n- Carbon (C): \\( 51.9 \\, \\text{g} \\times \\frac{1 \\, \\text{mol}}{12.01 \\, \\text{g}} = 4.32 \\, \\text{mol} \\)\n- Hydrogen (H): \\( 4.86 \\, \\text{g} \\times \\frac{1 \\, \\text{mol}}{1.008 \\, \\text{g}} = 4.84 \\, \\text{mol} \\)\n- Bromine (Br): \\( 43.2 \\, \\text{g} \\times \\frac{1 \\, \\text{mol}}{79.90 \\, \\text{g}} = 0.54 \\, \\text{mol} \\)\n\nNext, find the simplest whole-number ratio of these moles:\n- Carbon: 4.32 mol\n- Hydrogen: 4.84 mol\n- Bromine: 0.54 mol\n\nThe simplest ratio is 4.32:4.84:0.54. To simplify this ratio, we can divide each part by the greatest common divisor of the three numbers. The greatest common divisor of 4.32, 4.84, and 0.54 is 0.04.\n\nDivide each part by 0.04:\n- Carbon: \\( \\frac{4.32}{0.04} = 108 \\)\n- Hydrogen: \\( \\frac{4.84}{0.04} = 121 \\)\n- Bromine: \\( \\frac{0.54}{0.04} = 13.5 \\)\n\nThus, the simplest whole-number ratio of carbon, hydrogen, and bromine is 108:121:13.5.\n\nTo convert these ratios to whole numbers, we can multiply each part by the smallest number that will make all parts whole numbers. The smallest number is 13.5, so we multiply each part by 13.5:\n\n- Carbon: \\( 108 \\times 13.5 = 1458 \\)\n- Hydrogen: \\( 121 \\times 13.5 = 1648.5 \\)\n- Bromine: \\( 13.5 \\times 13.5 = 182.25 \\)\n\nThe simplest whole-number ratio of carbon, hydrogen, and bromine is 1458:1648.5:182.25.\n\nTo find the empirical formula, we need to divide each part by the smallest number in the ratio, which is 182.25:\n\n- Carbon: \\( \\frac{1458}{182.25} = 8 \\)\n- Hydrogen: \\( \\frac{1648.5}{182.25} = 9 \\)\n- Bromine: \\( \\frac{182.25}{182.25} = 1 \\)\n\nThus, the empirical formula of the compound is C8H9Br.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nC.
