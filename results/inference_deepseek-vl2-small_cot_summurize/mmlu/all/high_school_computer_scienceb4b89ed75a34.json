            "content": "To determine which statement is true, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **If the array is initially sorted in descending order, then insertion sort will be more efficient than selection sort.**\n\n   - Insertion sort is efficient for nearly sorted arrays because it only needs to compare and swap elements when they are out of order. However, if the array is already sorted in descending order, insertion sort will not perform any swaps, making it less efficient than selection sort, which will still perform comparisons and swaps. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nB. **The number of comparisons for selection sort is independent of the initial arrangement of elements.**\n\n   - Selection sort performs comparisons and swaps based on the current state of the array. If the array is already sorted, it will perform fewer comparisons and swaps. If the array is not sorted, it will perform more comparisons and swaps. Thus, the number of comparisons is dependent on the initial arrangement. This statement is false.\n\nC. **The number of comparisons for insertion sort is independent of the initial arrangement of elements.**\n\n   - Insertion sort performs comparisons and swaps only when elements are out of order. If the array is already sorted, it will perform no comparisons or swaps. If the array is not sorted, it will perform comparisons and swaps. Therefore, the number of comparisons is dependent on the initial arrangement. This statement is false.\n\nD. **The number of data movements in selection sort depends on the initial arrangement of elements.**\n\n   - Selection sort performs data movements (swaps) whenever it finds an element that is out of order. If the array is already sorted, it will perform no swaps, resulting in fewer data movements. If the array is not sorted, it will perform more swaps, resulting in more data movements. Thus, the number of data movements is dependent on the initial arrangement. This statement is true.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. The number of data movements in selection sort depends on the initial arrangement of elements.",
