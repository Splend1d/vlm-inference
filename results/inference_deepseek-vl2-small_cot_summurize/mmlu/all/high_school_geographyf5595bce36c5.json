It often involves a loss of the original cultural identity.\n\nB. **Acculturation**: This is the process by which immigrants learn the values, language, and customs of their new country. It involves the integration of new cultural elements into one's own culture, often resulting in a blend of the original and new cultures.\n\nC. **Adaptation**: This generally refers to the process of adjusting to a new environment or situation. While it can involve learning new customs, it is broader and does not specifically focus on cultural integration.\n\nD. **Amalgamation**: This term is not commonly used in the context of immigration and cultural integration. It might refer to the blending of different elements, but it is not a standard term in this context.\n\nGiven the definitions, the process of immigrants learning the values, language, and customs of their new country is best described by option B, **acculturation**. This process involves the integration of new cultural elements into one's own culture, which is a key aspect of how immigrants adapt to their new environment.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. acculturation**.",
