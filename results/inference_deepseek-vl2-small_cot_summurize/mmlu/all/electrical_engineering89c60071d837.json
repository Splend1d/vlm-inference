They are used in assembly language to denote specific operations or instructions. Mnemonics are translated into machine instructions during the assembly process.\n\nB. **Directives**: These are special commands in assembly language that are not translated into machine instructions. Directives are used to control the assembly process, such as specifying the output file format or the memory layout. They are not executed by the CPU but are used by the assembler to control the assembly process.\n\nC. **Identifiers**: These are names given to variables, labels, and other symbols in a program. Identifiers are not translated into machine instructions. They are used to refer to data and operations within the program.\n\nD. **Operands**: These are the data or values that are used in operations. Operands are not translated into machine instructions. They are the inputs or arguments to operations.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Directives\n\nDirectives are not translated into machine instructions during the assembly process. They are used to control the assembly process and are not executed by the CPU.",
