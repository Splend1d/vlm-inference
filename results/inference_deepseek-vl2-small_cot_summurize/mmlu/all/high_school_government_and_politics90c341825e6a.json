Fewer than 5% of petitions for writs of certiorari are granted by the Supreme Court.\n- This statement is true. The Supreme Court grants a small percentage of the petitions it receives. The exact percentage can vary, but it is generally less than 5%.\n\nB. The Supreme Court grants writs of certiorari only when there is a \"circuit split.\"\n- This statement is not entirely accurate. While a circuit split is a factor considered by the Supreme Court, it is not the only factor. The Court also considers the importance of the issue, the Solicitor General's recommendation, and the potential impact on the legal system.\n\nC. The lower court's ruling is overturned if the Supreme Court denies a writ of certiorari.\n- This statement is incorrect. A writ of certiorari is granted to review a decision of a lower court, not to overturn it. If the Supreme Court denies a writ of certiorari, it means it does not find the case worthy of review.\n\nD. Only the solicitor general may petition for a writ of certiorari.\n- This statement is false. While the Solicitor General often files briefs in support of a petition, anyone can petition for a writ of certiorari, including private parties, other government agencies, or even the losing party in a lower court.\n\nAfter evaluating each option, the most accurate statement is:\n\nA. Fewer than 5% of petitions for writs of certiorari are granted by the Supreme Court.",
