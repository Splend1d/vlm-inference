            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the molar mass of the metal and then use stoichiometry to find the mass of the metal that reacts with one mole of hydrochloric acid.\n\nFirst, let's find the molar mass of the metal. We know that 0.0623 grams of the metal produce 28.3 mL of hydrogen at STP. At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L (or 22,400 mL). Therefore, 28.3 mL of hydrogen is equivalent to 28.3/22,400 = 0.00126 moles of hydrogen.\n\nSince 0.0623 grams of metal produce 0.00126 moles of hydrogen, we can find the molar mass of the metal by dividing the mass of the metal by the moles of hydrogen produced:\n\nMolar mass of metal = mass of metal / moles of hydrogen\nMolar mass of metal = 0.0623 g / 0.00126 mol\nMolar mass of metal \u2248 49.47 g/mol\n\nNow, we can use stoichiometry to find the mass of the metal that reacts with one mole of hydrochloric acid. We know that 0.0623 grams of metal produce 0.00126 moles of hydrogen. Therefore, 1 mole of metal produces 0.00126 moles of hydrogen.\n\nSince 1 mole of metal produces 0.00126 moles of hydrogen, 1 mole of metal produces 0.00126 moles of HCl (because the reaction is 1:1).\n\nThe molar mass of HCl is approximately 36.46 g/mol. Therefore, the mass of 1 mole of HCl is:\n\nMass of HCl = moles of HCl * molar mass of HCl\nMass of HCl = 0.00126 mol * 36.46 g/mol\nMass of HCl \u2248 0.46 g\n\nSince the reaction is 1:1, the mass of the metal that reacts with one mole of hydrochloric acid is also approximately 0.46 g.\n\nTherefore, the mass of the metal that reacts with one mole of hydrochloric acid is approximately 49.47 g, which is closest to option D. However, since the question asks for the mass of the metal that reacts with one mole of hydrochloric acid, and the molar mass of the metal is approximately 49.47 g/mol, the mass of the metal that reacts with one mole of hydrochloric acid is approximately 49.47 g.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. 49.3 g.",
