            "content": "To determine the ratio of A:T in the newly synthesized complementary strand, we need to understand the process of DNA replication. DNA polymerase synthesizes a new strand by adding complementary nucleotides to the template strand. The template strand has a ratio of 3:2 of A:T bases.\n\n1. **Understand the Template Strand Ratio**: The template strand has 3 A's and 2 T's. This means the ratio of adenine (A) to thymine (T) is 3:2.\n\n2. **Complementary Base Pairing**: During DNA replication, the complementary base pairing rules are as follows:\n   - Adenine (A) pairs with Thymine (T).\n   - Cytosine (C) pairs with Guanine (G).\n\n3. **Synthesize the Complementary Strand**: Since the template strand has 3 A's, the complementary strand will have 3 T's.\n\n4. **Determine the New Ratio**: The new complementary strand will have 3 T's and 2 A's. Therefore, the ratio of A:T in the newly synthesized complementary strand is 2:3.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The correct ratio of A:T in the newly synthesized complementary strand is 2:3.\n\nThus, the correct answer is C. 2:03.",
