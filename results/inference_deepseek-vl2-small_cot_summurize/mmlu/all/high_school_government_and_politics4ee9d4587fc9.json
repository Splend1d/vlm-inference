            "content": "The correct answer is A. reflect population shifts indicated by the national census.\n\nThe boundary lines of congressional districts are redrawn every 10 years to ensure that each district has approximately the same number of residents. This process, known as redistricting, is required by the U.S. Constitution and is carried out by state legislatures or independent commissions in some states. The goal is to reflect the population changes that occur over the decade, as indicated by the national census. This helps to ensure that each district has a roughly equal number of voters, which is intended to maintain the principle of one person, one vote.\n\nThe other options are not correct for the following reasons:\n\nB. Guarantee the turnover of the majority of congressional seats: This is not the purpose of redistricting. While redistricting can lead to changes in the composition of the House of Representatives, it does not guarantee that the majority of seats will turnover.\n\nC. Make sure each state's congressional delegation exactly mirrors its residents' party affiliations: Redistricting is not intended to ensure that the party affiliations of the representatives in each district match the party affiliations of the residents in that district. Instead, it is designed to ensure that each district has a roughly equal number of voters, regardless of their party affiliation.\n\nD. Determine which party's leader will be named Speaker of the House: The Speaker of the House is elected by the members of the House of Representatives, not by the redistricting process. The Speaker is chosen by the majority party in the House, and redistricting does not influence this process.",
