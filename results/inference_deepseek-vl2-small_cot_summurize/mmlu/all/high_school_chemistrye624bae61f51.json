However, it is a conductor of electricity, which means it can allow the flow of electric current. Therefore, mercury does not meet the criteria of being a nonconducting substance.\n\nB. **Bromine**: Bromine is a liquid at room temperature and is also dark-colored. It is a nonconducting substance, meaning it does not allow the flow of electric current. This makes bromine a suitable candidate.\n\nC. **Iodine**: Iodine is a liquid at room temperature and is dark-colored. However, it is a conductor of electricity, so it does not meet the criteria of being a nonconducting substance.\n\nD. **Bismuth**: Bismuth is a solid at room temperature and is dark-colored. It is a nonconducting substance, which fits the criteria. However, the question specifies a liquid, so bismuth is not the correct answer.\n\nAfter evaluating each option, the correct answer is:\n\nB. **Bromine**",
