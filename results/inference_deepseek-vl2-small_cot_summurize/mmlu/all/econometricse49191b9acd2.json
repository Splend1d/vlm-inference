The acf (Autocorrelation Function) and pacf (Partial Autocorrelation Function) are often difficult to interpret because they can be complex and require a good understanding of statistical concepts.\n\n(ii) The acf and pacf can be difficult to calculate for some data sets.\n- This statement is true. Calculating the acf and pacf can be challenging, especially for large data sets or when the data has a complex structure.\n\n(iii) Information criteria represent an alternative approach to model order determination.\n- This statement is true. Information criteria, such as the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), are used to determine the optimal model order by balancing the trade-off between model complexity and goodness of fit.\n\n(iv) If applied correctly, the acf and pacf will always deliver unique model selections.\n- This statement is false. While the acf and pacf can provide valuable information about the model order, they do not always deliver unique model selections. In some cases, multiple models may have similar acf and pacf values, leading to ambiguity in model selection.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nB. (i) and (iii) only",
