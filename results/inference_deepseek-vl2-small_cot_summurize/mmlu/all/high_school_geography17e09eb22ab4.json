This region is known for its vast rainforests, which are being cleared for agriculture, logging, and mining. The expansion of these activities is leading to habitat loss and biodiversity decline. The Amazon is a critical carbon sink, and its destruction contributes to global climate change. The other regions listed are not experiencing the same level of large-scale commercial development in the context of subsistence agriculture.",
