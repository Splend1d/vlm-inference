            "content": "To determine which statement about Ethernets is typically FALSE, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Ethernets use circuit switching to send messages.\n- Circuit switching involves establishing a dedicated communication path between the sender and receiver before data transmission begins. This method is not used in Ethernet, which primarily employs packet switching. Therefore, this statement is FALSE.\n\nB. Ethernets use buses with multiple masters.\n- Ethernet networks often use a bus topology where multiple devices can share the same communication line. However, only one device acts as the master at any given time, controlling the data transmission. Thus, this statement is TRUE.\n\nC. Ethernet protocols use a collision-detection method to ensure that messages are transmitted properly.\n- Ethernet uses a collision detection method called Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) to manage data transmission. This method helps prevent collisions by allowing devices to detect when another device is transmitting. Therefore, this statement is TRUE.\n\nD. Networks connected by Ethernets are limited in length to a few hundred meters.\n- Ethernet networks are generally limited to a distance of about 100 meters for 10BASE-T and 100 meters for 100BASE-TX. However, with the use of repeaters and switches, the range can be extended. Thus, this statement is TRUE.\n\nAfter analyzing each statement, the statement that is typically FALSE is:\n\nA. Ethernets use circuit switching to send messages.",
