However, the question specifically asks about children aged 13-15, which is typically included in the YRBSS data.\n\nAccording to the CDC's 2015 report, the percentage of students aged 13-15 who reported being bullied at least once in the past 12 months was 46%. This figure is based on the survey data collected from students across the United States.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 46%",
