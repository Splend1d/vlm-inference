            "content": "To determine the maximum rate at which one computer can send data to another, we need to consider the following factors:\n\n1. **Packet Size**: Each packet is 1,000 bytes.\n2. **Network Capacity**: The network can carry 1,000 packets per second.\n3. **CPU Time for One Packet**: The CPU time required to execute the network protocol to send one packet is 10 milliseconds.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total data rate in bytes per second:\n\n- **Network Capacity**: 1,000 packets/second\n- **Packet Size**: 1,000 bytes/packet\n\nThe total data rate is:\n\\[ 1,000 \\text{ packets/second} \\times 1,000 \\text{ bytes/packet} = 1,000,000 \\text{ bytes/second} \\]\n\nNext, we need to account for the CPU time required to send one packet. The CPU time is 10 milliseconds, which is equivalent to 0.01 seconds.\n\nThe effective data rate, considering the CPU time, is:\n\\[ \\frac{1,000,000 \\text{ bytes/second}}{0.01 \\text{ seconds}} = 100,000,000 \\text{ bytes/second} \\]\n\nThus, the maximum rate at which one computer can send data to another is approximately:\n\\[ \\boxed{100,000,000 \\text{ bytes/second}} \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nC. 100,000 bytes/second",
