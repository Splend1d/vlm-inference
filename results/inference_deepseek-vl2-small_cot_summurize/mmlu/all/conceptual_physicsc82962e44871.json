It is approximately 343 meters per second at room temperature.\n   - **Frequency**: Frequency refers to the number of sound waves that pass a point per second. It is measured in Hertz (Hz).\n\n2. **Effect of an Approaching Object**:\n   - When a sound source (like a fire engine siren) approaches you, the waves are compressed. This compression increases the frequency of the sound waves.\n\n3. **Sound Waves and Frequency**:\n   - As the siren approaches, the distance between successive sound waves decreases. This means that the waves are closer together, resulting in a higher frequency.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the frequency of the sound increases as the siren approaches, the correct answer is that the sound has an increased frequency.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. frequency",
