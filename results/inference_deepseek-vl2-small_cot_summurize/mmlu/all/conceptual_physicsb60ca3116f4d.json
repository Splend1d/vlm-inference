The kinetic energy of a molecule is directly proportional to its temperature. Therefore, the gas with the highest temperature will have the fastest molecules.\n\nIn a mixture of gases, the temperature is determined by the average kinetic energy of the molecules. Since the temperature of a gas is directly related to the average speed of its molecules, the gas with the highest temperature will have the fastest molecules.\n\nIn the case of a mixture of hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen gases, the temperature of the mixture is determined by the temperature of the gas with the highest boiling point. Oxygen has the highest boiling point among the three gases, so it will have the highest temperature and, therefore, the fastest molecules on average.\n\nSo, the answer is B. oxygen.",
