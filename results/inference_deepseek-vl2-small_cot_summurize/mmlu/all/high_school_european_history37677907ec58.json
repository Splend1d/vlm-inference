            "content": "Herbert Spencer's Social Statistics: Survival of the Fittest Applied to Humankind, 1851, discusses the role of the state in protecting its citizens and the natural order of society. He argues that the state's role is to protect its citizens from the harsh realities of life, such as poverty, starvation, and the exploitation of the weak by the strong. He believes that these harsh realities are necessary for the survival of the fittest and the overall well-being of society.\n\nSpencer's views on the role of the state and the natural order of society are consistent with the principles of Social Darwinism, which is the application of the theory of evolution to human society. Social Darwinism posits that society is a competitive struggle for survival, and that the strong will survive and thrive, while the weak will fall by the wayside.\n\nTherefore, from the passage, one may infer that Spencer advocated for Social Darwinism.\n\nSo, the final answer is $\\boxed{D}$.",
