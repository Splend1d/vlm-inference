The operations performed are:\n\n1. Incrementing the count variable by 1\n2. Adding the current value to the sum variable\n3. Calculating the average by dividing the sum by the count\n4. Displaying the average\n\nInterchanging line 6 and line 7 will result in the following operations:\n\n1. Calculating the average by dividing the sum by the count\n2. Displaying the average\n3. Incrementing the count variable by 1\n4. Adding the current value to the sum variable\n\nThis will reduce the number of operations performed by 1, resulting in a correct program with a reduced number of operations performed.",
