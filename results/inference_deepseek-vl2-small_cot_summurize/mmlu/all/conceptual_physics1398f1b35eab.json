            "content": "To determine why a heavy rock and a light rock in free fall have the same acceleration, we need to consider the forces acting on each rock and how these forces relate to their mass.\n\n1. **Understanding Free Fall**: In free fall, there is no air resistance, and the only force acting on the rock is gravity. The acceleration due to gravity is given by the equation:\n   \\[\n   a = g\n   \\]\n   where \\( g \\) is the acceleration due to gravity, approximately \\( 9.8 \\, \\text{m/s}^2 \\) on Earth.\n\n2. **Force Due to Gravity**: The force due to gravity on an object is given by:\n   \\[\n   F = m \\cdot g\n   \\]\n   where \\( m \\) is the mass of the object.\n\n3. **Comparing Masses**: Since the heavy rock and the light rock are both in free fall, the force due to gravity on each rock is the same. This is because the mass of the heavy rock is greater, but the force due to gravity is directly proportional to the mass.\n\n4. **Acceleration**: The acceleration \\( a \\) of an object in free fall is given by:\n   \\[\n   a = \\frac{F}{m} = g\n   \\]\n   This shows that the acceleration is independent of the mass of the object.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The heavy rock and the light rock have the same acceleration because the force due to gravity is the same on each, and the acceleration is directly proportional to this force.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. force due to gravity is the same on each.",
