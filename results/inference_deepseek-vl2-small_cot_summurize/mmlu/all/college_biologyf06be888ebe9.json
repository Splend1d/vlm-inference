            "content": "A frameshift mutation is a type of genetic mutation that occurs when there is a change in the nucleotide sequence of a gene. This change results in a shift in the reading frame of the genetic code, which can lead to a completely different amino acid sequence being produced.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Telomeric sequences are removed from DNA: This option describes a deletion mutation, not a frameshift mutation. Telomeric sequences are repetitive DNA sequences at the ends of chromosomes, and their removal would not affect the reading frame of the gene.\n\nB. A codon's nucleotide sequence changes so that it calls for production of a different amino acid than the original one: This option describes a point mutation, not a frameshift mutation. A point mutation involves a change in a single nucleotide base, which can lead to a change in the amino acid sequence if the mutation occurs in a codon.\n\nC. A base pair is either inserted or deleted in a gene: This option describes a deletion or insertion mutation, not a frameshift mutation. These mutations involve the addition or removal of one or more nucleotide bases, which can affect the reading frame of the gene.\n\nD. A codon's nucleotide sequence is changed so that instead of coding for a given amino acid it acts to terminate translation: This option describes a frameshift mutation. When a codon is changed so that it codes for a different amino acid or acts to terminate translation, it shifts the reading frame of the gene. This can result in a completely different amino acid sequence being produced, which can have significant effects on the protein's function.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. A codon's nucleotide sequence is changed so that instead of coding for a given amino acid it acts to terminate translation.",
