            "content": "To determine which of the given bonds has the negative end of the bond written last, we need to understand the concept of the Lewis structure and the notation used in chemical bonding.\n\n1. **Lewis Structure Basics**: In a Lewis structure, atoms are represented by their chemical symbols, and bonds are drawn between them to show the sharing of electrons. The electrons in a bond are shared between the atoms, and the structure is drawn to minimize the number of formal charges.\n\n2. **Bonding Notation**: In chemical notation, the bond is written between the two atoms it connects. The atom with the higher electronegativity (or the atom that attracts electrons more strongly) is usually written first, and the other atom is written last.\n\n3. **Electronegativity Considerations**: Electronegativity is a measure of an atom's ability to attract and hold onto electrons. The more electronegative atom is usually written first in a bond.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\n- **A. O\u2014S**: Oxygen (O) is more electronegative than sulfur (S). Therefore, the bond is written with oxygen first, followed by sulfur.\n\n- **B. Br\u2014N**: Bromine (Br) is more electronegative than nitrogen (N). Thus, the bond is written with bromine first, followed by nitrogen.\n\n- **C. N\u2014C**: Nitrogen (N) is more electronegative than carbon (C). Hence, the bond is written with nitrogen first, followed by carbon.\n\n- **D. P\u2014Cl**: Phosphorus (P) is more electronegative than chlorine (Cl). Therefore, the bond is written with phosphorus first, followed by chlorine.\n\nIn all the options, the more electronegative atom is written first. Therefore, the negative end of the bond is not written last in any of the given options.\n\nThe correct answer is that none of the options have the negative end of the bond written last.",
