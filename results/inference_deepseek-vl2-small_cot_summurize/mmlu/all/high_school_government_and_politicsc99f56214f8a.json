            "content": "The Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act of 1985 and the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act of 1987 were designed to reduce the federal deficit by imposing spending limits on the federal government. These acts were part of a broader effort to control government spending and reduce the national debt.\n\nA. strengthening the military: While the Gramm-Rudman Acts did not specifically target military spending, they did aim to reduce overall government spending, which could have included military spending. However, the primary focus was on reducing the deficit rather than strengthening the military.\n\nB. increase funding for social programs: The Gramm-Rudman Acts did not increase funding for social programs. Instead, they imposed spending limits that could have reduced funding for social programs if the government exceeded the limits.\n\nC. reduce the federal deficit: This is the correct answer. The Gramm-Rudman Acts were designed to reduce the federal deficit by setting spending limits for the federal government. The act required the president to submit a budget that would reduce the deficit to a specified level by the end of the fiscal year. If the deficit was not reduced, automatic spending cuts were triggered.\n\nD. limit the president's ability to conduct foreign policy: The Gramm-Rudman Acts did not limit the president's ability to conduct foreign policy. They were focused on domestic spending and the federal budget, not foreign policy.\n\nTherefore, the primary goal of the Gramm-Rudman Acts of 1985 and 1987 was to reduce the federal deficit.",
