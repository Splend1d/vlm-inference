            "content": "To determine the possible product of the reaction where NO(g) is reduced and no nitrogen-containing compound is oxidized, we need to consider the changes in oxidation states of the nitrogen in the reactants and products.\n\n1. **Identify the Oxidation States**:\n   - In NO(g), nitrogen is in the +2 oxidation state.\n   - In NO2(g), nitrogen is in the +4 oxidation state.\n\n2. **Determine the Oxidation States of Products**:\n   - **Option A: NO2(g)**\n     - In NO2(g), nitrogen is in the +4 oxidation state.\n     - Since NO(g) is reduced, the nitrogen in NO2(g) must be reduced to a lower oxidation state.\n     - Therefore, NO2(g) is not a possible product.\n\n   - **Option B: N2(g)**\n     - In N2(g), nitrogen is in the 0 oxidation state.\n     - This is a stable state for nitrogen, and it does not involve any change in oxidation state.\n     - Therefore, N2(g) is a possible product.\n\n   - **Option C: NO3-(aq)**\n     - In NO3-(aq), nitrogen is in the +5 oxidation state.\n     - This is an increase in oxidation state, which means nitrogen is oxidized.\n     - Therefore, NO3-(aq) is not a possible product.\n\n   - **Option D: NO2-(aq)**\n     - In NO2-(aq), nitrogen is in the +4 oxidation state.\n     - This is the same oxidation state as NO2(g), which means nitrogen is not reduced.\n     - Therefore, NO2-(aq) is not a possible product.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - The only product that fits the criteria of NO(g) being reduced and no nitrogen-containing compound being oxidized is N2(g), as it involves a reduction in oxidation state from +2 to 0.\n\nThus, the correct answer is **B. N2(g)**.",
