Also, \\(\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} s_n t_n = st\\).\n\nTo understand this statement, we need to consider the properties of sequences of complex numbers and their limits.\n\n1. **Convergence of Sequences:**\n   - \\(\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} s_n = s\\) implies that the sequence \\(\\{s_n\\}\\) converges to \\(s\\).\n   - Similarly, \\(\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} t_n = t\\) implies that the sequence \\(\\{t_n\\}\\) converges to \\(t\\).\n\n2. **Product of Convergent Sequences:**\n   - If \\(\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} s_n = s\\) and \\(\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} t_n = t\\), then the product \\(\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} s_n t_n = st\\) implies that the product of the sequences \\(\\{s_n\\}\\) and \\(\\{t_n\\}\\) converges to \\(st\\).\n\nThus, Statement 1 is true.\n\n**Statement 2:** There exists a bounded sequence of real numbers with no convergent subsequence.\n\nTo understand this statement, we need to consider the properties of sequences of real numbers and their subsequences.\n\n1. **Bounded Sequences:**\n   - A sequence \\(\\{x_n\\}\\) is bounded if there exists a real number \\(M\\) such that \\(|x_n| \\leq M\\) for all \\(n\\).\n\n2. **Subsequences and Convergence:**\n   - A subsequence of a sequence \\(\\{x_n\\}\\) is a sequence obtained by rearranging the terms of \\(\\{x_n\\}\\) in some order.\n   - A subsequence of a bounded sequence is also bounded.\n   - If a subsequence of a bounded sequence converges, then the original sequence also converges.\n\nThus, it is possible to construct a bounded sequence of real numbers that does not have a convergent subsequence. For example, consider the sequence \\(\\{x_n\\} = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, \\ldots\\}\\). This sequence is bounded, but no subsequence of this sequence converges to a single value.\n\nTherefore, Statement 2 is true.\n\nSince both statements are true, the correct answer is:\n\nA.
