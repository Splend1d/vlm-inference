            "content": "To analyze the effects of a decline in aggregate demand on GDP and the price level in both the short run and the long run, we need to consider the mechanisms through which changes in aggregate demand affect the economy.\n\n1. **Short-Run Effects**:\n   - **GDP**: When aggregate demand decreases, firms produce less because there is less demand for their goods and services. This reduction in production leads to a decrease in GDP in the short run.\n   - **Price Level**: With reduced production, the supply of goods and services decreases, which can lead to higher prices (inflation) in the short run.\n\n2. **Long-Run Effects**:\n   - **GDP**: In the long run, the economy adjusts to the new level of aggregate demand. Firms may reduce their workforce, leading to higher unemployment. However, the economy will eventually reach a new equilibrium where the output is lower than the full employment level, but the price level will adjust to reflect the new lower level of demand.\n   - **Price Level**: The price level will adjust to reflect the new lower level of demand. This adjustment process can take time, but over the long run, the economy will return to a new equilibrium with a lower price level.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nB.
