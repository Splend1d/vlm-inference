A state is a sovereign entity that is recognized by the international community as having the capacity to enter into relations with other states. States have the power to govern their internal affairs, engage in international relations, and participate in international organizations.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Antarctica: Antarctica is a continent, not a state. It is not recognized as a sovereign entity by the international community. It is governed by the Antarctic Treaty System, which is a set of international agreements that aim to protect the continent's environment and scientific research.\n\nB. American Samoa: American Samoa is a territory of the United States, not a state. It is a part of the United States but does not have the same level of sovereignty as a state. It is governed by the United States federal government and does not have the ability to enter into international relations independently.\n\nC. Egypt: Egypt is a state. It is recognized by the international community as a sovereign entity with the capacity to enter into relations with other states. Egypt is a member of the United Nations and has the power to govern its internal affairs and engage in international relations.\n\nD. Marshall Islands: The Marshall Islands is a country, not a state. It is a sovereign nation that is recognized by the international community. However, it is not a state in the same sense as Egypt, as it is not a member of the United Nations and does not have the same level of sovereignty.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is C. Egypt is a state.",
