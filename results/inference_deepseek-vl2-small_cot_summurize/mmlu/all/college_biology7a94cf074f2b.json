This disruption leads to cell lysis and death.\n\nB. **Protein synthesis**: Antibiotics such as tetracyclines and macrolides inhibit protein synthesis by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit. This prevents the addition of new amino acids to the growing polypeptide chain, effectively halting protein synthesis.\n\nC. **DNA synthesis**: Antibiotics like aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones inhibit DNA synthesis by binding to bacterial DNA polymerase, preventing the replication of DNA. This is a critical step in bacterial growth and reproduction.\n\nD. **Reverse transcriptase**: This enzyme is involved in the replication of RNA viruses, such as HIV. Antibiotics that target reverse transcriptase are not typically used to treat bacterial infections.\n\nGiven this analysis, the antibiotic that does not affect bacterial cells by interfering with any of the listed processes is the one that targets reverse transcriptase.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. reverse transcriptase.",
