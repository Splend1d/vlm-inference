It involves the arrangement of words to form phrases and sentences, not variations in vocabulary, pronunciation, or rhythm.\n\nB. Isoglosses are areas where a particular feature of a language, such as pronunciation or vocabulary, is consistent. They are not variations in these features but rather regions where a language is spoken uniformly.\n\nC. Lingua francas are languages that are used as a common language for communication among people who speak different languages. They are not related to variations in vocabulary, pronunciation, or rhythm.\n\nD. Dialects are variations in a language that are spoken in different regions or by different groups of people. They can differ in vocabulary, pronunciation, and rhythm. For example, American English and British English are dialects of the English language.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is D. Dialects. Variations in vocabulary, pronunciation, and rhythm in a spoken language are indeed called dialects.",
