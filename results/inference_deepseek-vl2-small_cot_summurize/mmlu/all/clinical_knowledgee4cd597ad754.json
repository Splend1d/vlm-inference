This is crucial because cardiac arrest is a medical emergency that requires prompt intervention to restore the heart's normal rhythm.\n\nB. giving two rescue breaths is not the first action. Rescue breaths are typically given after the first chest compression and are part of the CPR protocol, but they are not the initial step.\n\nC. giving 30 chest compressions is not the first action. While chest compressions are a critical component of CPR, the first action is to call for emergency services.\n\nD. checking the notes to see if the patient has a DNAR (Do Not Attempt Resuscitation) order is not the first action. While this information is important for medical personnel, it is not the immediate priority in the initial response to cardiac arrest.\n\nTherefore, the first action following confirmation of cardiac arrest is to ensure the emergency team/services are called.",
