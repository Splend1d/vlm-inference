            "content": "To determine the duration of maximal exertion exercise that can be sustained by the energy released from the breakdown of ATP and phosphocreatine, we need to understand the role of these molecules in cellular energy production.\n\nATP (adenosine triphosphate) and phosphocreatine (PCr) are crucial for providing energy to cells, particularly during short bursts of high-intensity activity. When ATP is hydrolyzed to ADP (adenosine diphosphate) and inorganic phosphate, energy is released. This energy is then used to phosphorylate proteins, allowing them to function.\n\nThe breakdown of ATP and phosphocreatine provides a rapid supply of energy, but the energy yield per molecule is relatively low. ATP provides about 7.3 kcal/mol, while phosphocreatine provides about 11.2 kcal/mol. However, the energy yield per second is approximately 1.5 kcal/s for ATP and 1.8 kcal/s for phosphocreatine.\n\nGiven these values, the energy released per second is sufficient to sustain maximal exertion for a short duration. The energy yield per second is higher for phosphocreatine, which is why it can sustain maximal exertion for a slightly longer period compared to ATP.\n\nConsidering these factors, the energy released from the breakdown of ATP and phosphocreatine can sustain maximal exertion exercise for about 5-10 seconds.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 5-10 seconds.",
