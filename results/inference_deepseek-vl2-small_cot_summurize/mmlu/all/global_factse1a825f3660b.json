            "content": "To determine the approximate difference in approval of school desegregation between the South and the rest of the U.S., we need to consider the historical context and the data available.\n\n1. **Historical Context**: School desegregation refers to the integration of schools in the U.S., particularly in the South, where racial segregation was a significant issue. The Civil Rights Movement, which gained momentum in the 1950s and 1960s, aimed to end segregation in schools.\n\n2. **Data Analysis**: According to historical records, during the 1950s, the South was predominantly opposed to school desegregation. Surveys and studies from that era indicate that a significant portion of the Southern population opposed desegregation.\n\n3. **Approximation**: It is estimated that the South had an approval rate of around 40% for school desegregation, while the rest of the U.S. had a higher approval rate, possibly around 80%.\n\n4. **Calculation of Difference**: To find the difference in approval rates, we subtract the lower approval rate from the higher approval rate:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Difference} = 80\\% - 40\\% = 40\\%\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the approximate difference in approval of school desegregation between the South and the rest of the U.S. was 40%.\n\nThe correct answer is B. 40%.",
