Canada: Canada is known for its bilingual nature, with both English and French being official languages. However, the country's linguistic diversity is not as pronounced as in some other countries, and the two official languages are relatively close in terms of usage and influence.\n\nB. United States: The United States is a multilingual country with English as the primary language, but it also has significant populations of Spanish speakers, particularly in the southern states. While there are regional language variations, the country's linguistic diversity is not as centrifugal as in some other nations.\n\nC. Brazil: Brazil is a multilingual country with Portuguese as the official language, but it also has significant indigenous languages and African languages spoken by various ethnic groups. The country's linguistic diversity is one of its defining characteristics, with different regions and ethnic groups having their own languages. This diversity can lead to a centrifugal force, as different language groups may have distinct cultural identities and interests that can sometimes diverge from the national identity.\n\nD. Norway: Norway is a monocultural country with Norwegian as the sole official language. While there are regional dialects, the language is relatively uniform across the country, and the cultural identity is largely centered around the Norwegian language.\n\nBased on this analysis, the country where language poses a centrifugal force is Brazil, due to its significant linguistic diversity and the presence of multiple languages that can contribute to regional and ethnic differences.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Brazil.",
