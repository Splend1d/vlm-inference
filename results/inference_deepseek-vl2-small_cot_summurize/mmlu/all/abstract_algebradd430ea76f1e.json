The characteristic of a ring is the smallest positive integer \\( p \\) such that \\( p \\mid a \\) for all \\( a \\in R \\).\n\n- If a ring has characteristic 0, it means that for any non-zero element \\( a \\) in the ring, \\( a \\) is not divisible by any prime number.\n- An integral domain with characteristic 0 implies that the ring is infinite because there are no prime numbers that divide any non-zero element.\n\nThus, Statement 1 is true.\n\n**Statement 2: Every integral domain with prime characteristic is finite.**\n\n- A ring with prime characteristic has a smallest prime number \\( p \\) such that \\( p \\mid a \\) for all \\( a \\in R \\).\n- If a ring has prime characteristic, it means that there exists a smallest prime number \\( p \\) that divides every non-zero element of the ring.\n- This implies that the ring is finite because it must have a finite number of elements that are divisible by \\( p \\).\n\nThus, Statement 2 is true.\n\nSince both statements are true, the correct answer is:\n\nA.
