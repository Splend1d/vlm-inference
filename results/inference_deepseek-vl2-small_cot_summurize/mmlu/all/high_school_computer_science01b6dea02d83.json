This is the smallest and simplest time complexity, as it does not depend on the input size.\n\n- O(n) represents a linear time complexity, where the running time increases linearly with the size of the input.\n\n- O(n^2) represents a quadratic time complexity, where the running time increases quadratically with the size of the input.\n\n- O(log n) represents a logarithmic time complexity, where the running time increases logarithmically with the size of the input.\n\nSince O(1) is the smallest and simplest time complexity, it is the correct answer.",
