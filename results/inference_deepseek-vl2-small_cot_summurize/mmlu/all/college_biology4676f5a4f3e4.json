It works by inhibiting the synthesis of the bacterial cell wall, leading to cell lysis and death. Penicillin does not affect eukaryotic cells, so it cannot induce polyploidy.\n\nB. **Colchicine**: This is a plant extract that is known to inhibit the microtubule formation in eukaryotic cells. By disrupting the mitotic spindle, colchicine prevents the proper segregation of chromosomes during cell division, leading to polyploidy. This is why colchicine is often used in horticulture to induce polyploidy in plants.\n\nC. **Tetracycline**: This antibiotic is used to treat bacterial infections and is known to inhibit protein synthesis in bacteria. It does not affect eukaryotic cells, so it cannot induce polyploidy.\n\nD. **Puromycin**: This antibiotic is used to treat bacterial infections and is known to inhibit protein synthesis in bacteria. Like tetracycline, it does not affect eukaryotic cells, so it cannot induce polyploidy.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Colchicine\n\nColchicine is the agent that will induce polyploidy in a dividing eukaryote by interfering with the mitotic spindle, leading to the accumulation of extra chromosomes.",
