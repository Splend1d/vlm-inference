A 5\u2032 cap and the poly-A tail are added after the preRNA leaves the nucleus.\n- This statement is incorrect. Introns are not removed in the nucleus; they are removed during RNA processing. The 5\u2032 cap and poly-A tail are added after the preRNA has left the nucleus.\n\nB. Introns are removed and both a 5\u2032 cap and a poly-A tail are added before the preRNA leaves the nucleus.\n- This statement is correct. During RNA processing, introns are removed, and both a 5\u2032 cap and a poly-A tail are added to the preRNA before it exits the nucleus.\n\nC. Exons are removed and a 5\u2032 cap is added before the preRNA leaves the nucleus. After leaving the nucleus, the poly-A tail is added.\n- This statement is incorrect. Exons are not removed; they are retained in the final mRNA. The 5\u2032 cap is added before the preRNA leaves the nucleus, but the poly-A tail is added after the preRNA exits the nucleus.\n\nD. Point mutations are repaired, exons are removed, and both a 5\u2032 cap and a poly-A tail are added before the preRNA leaves the nucleus.\n- This statement is incorrect. Point mutations are not repaired during RNA processing. Exons are not removed; they are retained. The 5\u2032 cap and poly-A tail are added before the preRNA leaves the nucleus.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Introns are removed and both a 5\u2032 cap and a poly-A tail are added before the preRNA leaves the nucleus.",
