            "content": "To determine the relationship between the power input and the power output of an ideal transformer, we need to understand the fundamental principles of how transformers operate.\n\n1. **Definition of an Ideal Transformer**: An ideal transformer is a theoretical model that assumes no energy losses (such as resistance losses or core losses) and perfect efficiency. In real-world applications, transformers are not perfectly efficient, but for the purpose of this question, we will consider an ideal transformer.\n\n2. **Power Input and Output in an Ideal Transformer**:\n   - **Power Input (P_in)**: This is the power supplied to the primary coil of the transformer.\n   - **Power Output (P_out)**: This is the power delivered to the secondary coil of the transformer.\n\n3. **Conservation of Energy**: According to the principle of conservation of energy, the power input to the transformer must equal the power output. This is because energy cannot be created or destroyed, only converted from one form to another.\n\n4. **Mathematical Representation**:\n   - The power input to the transformer is given by \\( P_{\\text{in}} = V_{\\text{in}} \\times I_{\\text{in}} \\), where \\( V_{\\text{in}} \\) is the voltage in the primary coil and \\( I_{\\text{in}} \\) is the current in the primary coil.\n   - The power output to the transformer is given by \\( P_{\\text{out}} = V_{\\text{out}} \\times I_{\\text{out}} \\), where \\( V_{\\text{out}} \\) is the voltage in the secondary coil and \\( I_{\\text{out}} \\) is the current in the secondary coil.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since the power input and power output are equal in an ideal transformer, the power output is the same as the power input.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. the same",
