            "content": "When the Supreme Court decides to take a case on appeal, it issues a writ of certiorari. This is the correct answer.\n\nA writ of certiorari is a legal document that grants the Supreme Court the authority to hear a case. It is typically issued when a lower court has ruled on a case and the parties involved are seeking a higher court's review of the decision. The Supreme Court then reviews the case to determine whether it should be heard by the entire court or by a specific justice.\n\nA writ of habeas corpus is a legal document that orders a person to be brought before a court to determine if their detention is lawful. It is not used to decide whether to take a case on appeal.\n\nAn amicus curiae brief is a legal document filed by an individual or organization that is not a party to a case but has a particular interest in the outcome. It is not used to decide whether to take a case on appeal.\n\nJudicial review is the power of a court to review the actions of other branches of government, such as the executive or legislative branches. It is not used to decide whether to take a case on appeal.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. issues a writ of certiorari.",
