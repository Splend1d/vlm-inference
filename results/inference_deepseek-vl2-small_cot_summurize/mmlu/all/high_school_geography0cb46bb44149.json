A formal region is a geographic area that is defined by a specific boundary and has a distinct identity. It is often used in administrative and political contexts to define areas for governance, planning, and resource allocation.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Dixie**: This term is often used informally to refer to the Southern United States, particularly in the context of sports teams and cultural references. It is not a formally defined region with specific boundaries.\n\nB. **Pennsylvania**: This is a state in the United States, which is a formal region. It has a defined boundary and is recognized as a separate entity for administrative purposes.\n\nC. **The market area of Winn-Dixie**: This is a commercial area defined by the geographic location of Winn-Dixie stores. It is not a formal region because it lacks a defined boundary and is not recognized as a separate administrative entity.\n\nD. **The Pacific Northwest**: This is a region in the northwestern part of the United States and southwestern Canada. It is a formal region because it has a defined boundary and is recognized as a distinct area for various purposes, including environmental management and economic planning.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nD.
