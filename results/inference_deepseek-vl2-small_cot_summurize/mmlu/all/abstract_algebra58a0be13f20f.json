This means that for any \\( a, b \\in H \\), the product \\( ab \\) must also be in \\( H \\).\n- If \\( aH \\) is a subgroup of \\( G \\), then for any \\( aH \\in aH \\), we need to show that \\( aH \\) is closed under the group operation.\n- If \\( a \\in H \\), then \\( aH \\) is closed under the group operation because \\( a \\) is in \\( H \\).\n- Conversely, if \\( aH \\) is closed under the group operation, then for any \\( aH \\in aH \\), \\( aH \\) must be in \\( H \\).\n- Therefore, \\( aH \\) is a subgroup of \\( G \\) if and only if \\( a \\) is in \\( H \\).\n\nThus, Statement 1 is true.\n\n**Statement 2:** If \\( H \\) is a subgroup of \\( G \\) and \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) belong to \\( G \\), then \\( aH = bH \\) if and only if \\( ab \\) is in \\( H \\).\n\n- For \\( aH = bH \\) to hold, \\( aH \\) and \\( bH \\) must be equal, which means they must have the same elements.\n- If \\( aH = bH \\), then for any \\( x \\in aH \\), \\( x \\) must also be in \\( bH \\).\n- Conversely, if \\( ab \\) is in \\( H \\), then for any \\( x \\in aH \\), \\( x \\) must also be in \\( bH \\) because \\( ab \\) is in \\( H \\).\n- Therefore, \\( aH = bH \\) if and only if \\( ab \\) is in \\( H \\).\n\nThus, Statement 2 is true.\n\nSince both statements are true, the correct answer is:\n\nA.
