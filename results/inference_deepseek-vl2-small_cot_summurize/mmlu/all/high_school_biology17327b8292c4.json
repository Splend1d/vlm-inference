            "content": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Water moves from the potato into the surrounding water.\n- This statement is incorrect. When a potato is immersed in water, water moves into the potato, not the other way around. This is due to osmosis, where water moves from an area of lower solute concentration (the surrounding water) to an area of higher solute concentration (inside the potato cells).\n\nB. Water moves from the surrounding water into the potato.\n- This statement is correct. Osmosis is the process by which water molecules move across a semipermeable membrane from a region of lower solute concentration to a region of higher solute concentration. In this case, the potato cells have a higher solute concentration than the surrounding water, causing water to move into the potato.\n\nC. Potato cells plasmolyze.\n- This statement is incorrect. Plasmolyzation occurs when the cell membrane pulls away from the cell wall due to water loss, often seen in plant cells in hypotonic solutions. In this scenario, the potato is in a hypotonic solution, so water moves into the potato, not out, and plasmolyzation does not occur.\n\nD. Solutes in the water move into the potato.\n- This statement is incorrect. Osmosis involves the movement of water, not solutes, across a semipermeable membrane. Solutes remain in the water, and water moves into the potato.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Water moves from the surrounding water into the potato.",
