An increase in government spending matched by an equal increase in taxes:\n- This policy increases aggregate demand because government spending is a component of aggregate demand.\n- However, the increase in taxes reduces disposable income, which can decrease consumption.\n- The net effect on aggregate demand is positive, but the increase in taxes partially offsets the increase in spending, leading to a smaller increase in inflation compared to other options.\n\nB. An increase in government spending with no change in taxes:\n- This policy increases aggregate demand significantly because government spending is a major component of aggregate demand.\n- There is no offsetting decrease in consumption due to taxes, so the full effect of the increased spending is felt in the economy.\n- This results in a substantial increase in inflation in the short run.\n\nC. A decrease in government spending and a matching increase in taxes:\n- This policy decreases aggregate demand because government spending is a component of aggregate demand.\n- The increase in taxes reduces disposable income, further decreasing consumption.\n- The net effect on aggregate demand is negative, which would typically lead to a decrease in inflation, not an increase.\n\nD. A decrease in taxes with no change in government spending:\n- This policy increases aggregate demand because lower taxes increase disposable income, leading to higher consumption.\n- However, the decrease in government spending is a negative component of aggregate demand.\n- The net effect on aggregate demand is positive, but the decrease in government spending partially offsets the increase in consumption, leading to a smaller increase in inflation compared to option B.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the policy that will create the most inflation in the short run is:\n\nB. An increase in government spending with no change in taxes.",
