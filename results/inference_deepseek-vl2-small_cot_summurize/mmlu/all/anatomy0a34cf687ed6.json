The primary enzyme in saliva is amylase, which is crucial for the initial breakdown of carbohydrates.\n\n- **Option A: Starches**\n  - Starches are complex carbohydrates that are broken down into simpler sugars by the enzyme amylase. Saliva contains amylase, which begins the process of starch digestion. Therefore, saliva acts upon starches.\n\n- **Option B: Proteins**\n  - Proteins are broken down by enzymes such as pepsin in the stomach and trypsin in the small intestine. Saliva does not contain enzymes that break down proteins.\n\n- **Option C: Fats**\n  - Fats are broken down by enzymes like lipase, which is produced in the pancreas and not in saliva. Therefore, saliva does not act upon fats.\n\n- **Option D: Minerals**\n  - Minerals are not broken down by enzymes in saliva. They are absorbed directly into the bloodstream.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Starches\n\nSaliva contains amylase, which acts on starches, initiating their breakdown into simpler sugars.",
