It has a diameter of 100 meters, making it one of the largest radio telescopes in the world.\n\nB. **Arecibo Telescope**: Located in Puerto Rico, this telescope has a diameter of 305 meters, making it the largest single-dish radio telescope in the world.\n\nC. **Yevpatoria RT-70 Telescope**: This is located in Crimea, Ukraine. It has a diameter of 76 meters, which is smaller compared to the other options.\n\nD. **Effelsberg Telescope**: Located in Germany, this telescope has a diameter of 100 meters, similar to the Green Bank Telescope.\n\nBy comparing the diameters of these telescopes, we can see that the Arecibo Telescope has the largest parabolic antenna with a diameter of 305 meters.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Arecibo Telescope.",
