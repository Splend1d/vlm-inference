Green Revolution.\n\nThe Green Revolution refers to a period of significant agricultural development that began in the 1940s and 1950s, primarily in Asia and Latin America. It was characterized by the introduction of high-yielding varieties of wheat, rice, and other crops, as well as the widespread use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. This revolution was driven by the efforts of core countries, particularly the United States, to increase agricultural production in the periphery, often through the use of technology, hybrid seed, and fertilizers. The goal was to address food shortages and improve the economic conditions of developing countries. The Green Revolution had a profound impact on global agriculture, leading to increased food production and reducing the number of people suffering from hunger.",
