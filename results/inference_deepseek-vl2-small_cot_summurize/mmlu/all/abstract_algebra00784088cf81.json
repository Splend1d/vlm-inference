This is because the cosets of \\( aH \\) are precisely the cosets of \\( Ha \\) under the action of \\( H \\).\n- Therefore, \\( |aH| = |Ha| \\).\n\nThus, Statement 1 is true.\n\n**Statement 2: If \\( H \\) is a subgroup of \\( G \\) and \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) belong to \\( G \\), then \\( aH \\) and \\( Hb \\) are identical or disjoint.**\n\n- \\( aH \\) and \\( Hb \\) are distinct cosets of \\( H \\) in \\( G \\).\n- The cosets of \\( H \\) in \\( G \\) are the set of all possible products of elements of \\( H \\) with elements of \\( G \\).\n- Since \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are arbitrary elements of \\( G \\), \\( aH \\) and \\( Hb \\) can be any two distinct cosets of \\( H \\) in \\( G \\).\n- Therefore, \\( aH \\) and \\( Hb \\) are not necessarily identical or disjoint; they can be either identical or disjoint, but they are not necessarily the same.\n\nThus, Statement 2 is false.\n\nGiven the analysis:\n- Statement 1 is true.\n- Statement 2 is false.\n\nThe correct answer is \\(\\boxed{C}\\).",
