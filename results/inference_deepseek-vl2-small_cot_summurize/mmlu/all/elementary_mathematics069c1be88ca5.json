Since each row has 7 plants, dividing 42 by 7 will give us the number of rows.\n\nB. 42 \u2013 7: This expression represents the subtraction of 7 from 42, which doesn't give us the number of rows.\n\nC. 42 + 7: This expression represents the addition of 7 to 42, which also doesn't give us the number of rows.\n\nD. 42 \u00d7 7: This expression represents the multiplication of 42 by 7, which gives us the total number of plants, not the number of rows.\n\nTherefore, the correct expression to find the number of rows in Ron\u2019s garden is:\n\nA. 42 \u00f7 7",
