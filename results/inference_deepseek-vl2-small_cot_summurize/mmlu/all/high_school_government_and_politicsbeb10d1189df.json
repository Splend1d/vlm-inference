            "content": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Judicial Activism: This term refers to the Supreme Court's tendency to make decisions that are not in line with the law as it was understood at the time of the decision. It involves the Court making changes to public policy or altering judicial precedent to reflect current societal values or political realities. This aligns with the description of a Supreme Court that is willing to change public policy and alter judicial precedent.\n\nB. Due Process: This is a constitutional principle that ensures fairness in legal proceedings. It does not specifically refer to the Court's role in changing public policy or altering judicial precedent.\n\nC. Judicial Restraint: This term describes the tendency of the Court to limit its power and avoid making decisions that might be seen as overreaching. It is the opposite of judicial activism, as it involves a more conservative approach to interpreting the law.\n\nD. Ex Post Facto Lawmaking: This is a legal term that refers to the retroactive application of the law, which is generally considered unconstitutional. It does not describe the Court's role in changing public policy or altering judicial precedent.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is A. Judicial Activism. The Supreme Court engaging in judicial activism is one that is willing to change public policy and alter judicial precedent.",
