            "content": "To determine the percentage of the world population living in extreme poverty as of 2019, we need to consider the global poverty line set by the World Bank. The World Bank defines extreme poverty as living on less than $1.90 per day.\n\n1. **Understanding Poverty Lines**: The World Bank uses a poverty line to measure the income needed to meet basic needs. This line varies by country but is generally set at $1.90 per day for extreme poverty.\n\n2. **Global Population**: According to the World Bank, the global population in 2019 was approximately 7.8 billion people.\n\n3. **Calculating Extreme Poverty**: To find the percentage of the global population living in extreme poverty, we need to calculate the number of people living on less than $1.90 per day and then divide that by the total global population.\n\n   - **Step 1**: Calculate the number of people living in extreme poverty.\n     - If 1.90 dollars per day is the poverty line, and the global population is 7.8 billion, then the number of people living in extreme poverty is:\n       \\[\n       \\text{Number of people in extreme poverty} = 7.8 \\text{ billion} \\times 1.90 \\text{ dollars/day}\n       \\]\n\n   - **Step 2**: Perform the calculation.\n     - \\[\n     7.8 \\text{ billion} \\times 1.90 \\text{ dollars/day} = 14.82 \\text{ billion dollars/day}\n     \\]\n\n   - **Step 3**: Calculate the percentage.\n     - To find the percentage, divide the number of people in extreme poverty by the total global population and multiply by 100:\n       \\[\n       \\text{Percentage} = \\left(\\frac{14.82 \\text{ billion dollars/day}}{7.8 \\text{ billion people}}\\right) \\times 100\n       \\]\n\n   - **Step 4**: Perform the calculation.\n     - \\[\n     \\left(\\frac{14.82}{7.8}\\right) \\times 100 \\approx 189.9974\n     \\]\n\n   - **Step 5**: Round to the nearest whole number.\n     - The percentage is approximately 190%.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The correct answer is D. 25%, as the closest option to our calculated percentage of 190%.\n\nTherefore, the percentage of the world population living in extreme poverty as of 2019 is approximately 25%.",
