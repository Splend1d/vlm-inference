            "content": "To determine the percentage of agriculture in India's GDP in 2015, we need to consider the economic structure of India at that time. India is known for its diverse economy, which includes a significant agricultural sector.\n\n1. **Understanding GDP Composition**: The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of a country is the total value of all goods and services produced over a specific period. It is divided into three main sectors: agriculture, industry, and services.\n\n2. **Agricultural Contribution**: Agriculture is a major sector in India, employing a large portion of the workforce. Historically, agriculture has been a significant contributor to India's GDP.\n\n3. **Historical Data**: In 2015, agriculture accounted for about 16% of India's GDP. This figure reflects the importance of agriculture in the Indian economy, despite the growth of other sectors like manufacturing and services.\n\n4. **Analyzing Options**:\n   - **Option A (8%)**: This is too low, as agriculture is a major sector.\n   - **Option B (16%)**: This is the correct percentage, reflecting the historical and ongoing significance of agriculture in India's economy.\n   - **Option C (32%)**: This is too high, as it would imply a much larger contribution from agriculture than other sectors.\n   - **Option D (64%)**: This is extremely high and not plausible, as it would suggest agriculture is the sole contributor to the economy.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. 16%**. This percentage highlights the substantial role agriculture plays in India's economic framework.",
