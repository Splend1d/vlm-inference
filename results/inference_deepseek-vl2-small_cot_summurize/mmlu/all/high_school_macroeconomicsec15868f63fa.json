Allocative efficiency refers to a situation where resources are used in the most beneficial way possible, ensuring that the goods and services produced are what society values the most.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Means that no inferior products will be produced.**\n   - This statement is true in the sense that allocative efficiency aims to ensure that resources are used to produce goods and services that are valued by society. However, it does not specifically address the distribution of resources or the value of the products.\n\nB. **Implies that the economy's output is distributed evenly.**\n   - This statement is incorrect. Allocative efficiency focuses on the distribution of resources to produce goods and services that are most valued by society, not on the distribution of income or wealth.\n\nC. **Means that those who work hardest will get more.**\n   - This statement is misleading. Allocative efficiency is about the allocation of resources to produce goods and services that are most valued, not about rewarding individuals based on their effort.\n\nD. **Implies that resources are used to produce the goods and services society desires in just the right amounts.**\n   - This statement accurately describes allocative efficiency. It ensures that resources are allocated in a way that maximizes the production of goods and services that are most desired by society, thus achieving a balance between supply and demand.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Allocative efficiency implies that resources are used to produce the goods and services society desires in just the right amounts, ensuring that the economy operates in a way that maximizes overall welfare.",
