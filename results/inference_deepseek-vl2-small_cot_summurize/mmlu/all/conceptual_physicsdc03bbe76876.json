It is directed towards the center of the circle.\n\n3. **Net Force**:\n   - The net force is the vector sum of all forces acting on the can.\n   - Since the gravitational force is constant and acts downward, and the centripetal force acts inward, the net force must be directed outward to counteract the downward gravitational force and provide the necessary centripetal force.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The net force on the can is directed outward.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. outward",
