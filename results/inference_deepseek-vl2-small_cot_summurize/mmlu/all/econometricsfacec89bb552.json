They are distinct and separate from one another. Examples include 1, 2, 3, etc. The price of a house is not a discrete number because it can be any value within a range, not just whole numbers.\n\nB. **Cardinal**: Cardinal numbers are numbers that can be used to count items. They have a magnitude or size. Examples include 1, 2, 3, etc. The price of a house is not a cardinal number because it does not have a magnitude or size; it can be any value.\n\nC. **Ordinal**: Ordinal numbers are used to indicate the position or rank of an item in a sequence. They are used to describe order but do not have a magnitude. Examples include 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc. The price of a house is not an ordinal number because it does not indicate position or rank; it can be any value.\n\nD. **Nominal**: Nominal numbers are used to label or identify items without any numerical value. They are used to categorize or name things. Examples include names, colors, or types. The price of a house is a nominal number because it is used to label or identify the house, not to measure or quantify it.\n\nTherefore, the price of a house is best described as a **nominal** number.",
