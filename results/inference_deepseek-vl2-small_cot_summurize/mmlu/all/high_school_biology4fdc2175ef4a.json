            "content": "To determine the probability of a child inheriting sickle-cell disease, we need to understand the genetic basis of the disease. Sickle-cell disease is an autosomal recessive disorder, meaning that a child must inherit two copies of the sickle-cell gene (one from each parent) to express the disease.\n\n1. **Genetic Background**: \n   - The sickle-cell gene is located on chromosome 11.\n   - A person with one normal allele (H) and one sickle-cell allele (h) is a carrier (Hh).\n   - A person with two sickle-cell alleles (hh) will express the disease.\n\n2. **Probability of Inheriting the Disease**:\n   - The probability of a child inheriting the sickle-cell allele from the mother is 50% (since the mother can either pass on the normal allele or the sickle-cell allele).\n   - The probability of a child inheriting the sickle-cell allele from the father is also 50% (since the father can either pass on the normal allele or the sickle-cell allele).\n\n3. **Calculating the Combined Probability**:\n   - The probability of a child inheriting the sickle-cell allele from both parents is the product of the probabilities of inheriting from each parent:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Probability} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{4} = 25\\%\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the chance that a child will inherit sickle-cell disease is 25%.\n\nThe correct answer is D. 25%.",
