In this scenario, the balloon is being submerged in water, and the buoyant force is determined by the volume of water displaced by the balloon.\n\nAs the balloon sinks deeper into the lake, the volume of water displaced by the balloon increases because the balloon is taking up more space in the water. According to Archimedes' principle, the buoyant force should increase as the volume of water displaced increases.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. increases.",
