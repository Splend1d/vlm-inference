            "content": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Legislation, Sarbanes-Oxley Act: This option suggests that legislation is a key factor in driving ethical business practices, specifically referencing the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. While the Sarbanes-Oxley Act is a significant piece of legislation aimed at improving corporate governance and accountability, it is not the only factor. Legislation alone does not necessarily drive ethical practices; it provides a framework and rules that companies must follow.\n\nB. Internal company policy, Unethical corporate practices act: This option implies that internal company policy is a key factor, but it incorrectly references the \"Unethical corporate practices act.\" The correct term is the \"Sarbanes-Oxley Act,\" which is a piece of legislation, not an act.\n\nC. Internal company policy, Sarbanes-Oxley Act: This option correctly identifies both internal company policy and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act as key factors. Internal company policies establish the ethical standards and guidelines that employees must follow, while the Sarbanes-Oxley Act provides the legal framework that ensures these policies are enforced.\n\nD. Legislation, Unethical corporate practices act: This option incorrectly combines legislation with an act, which is not accurate. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act is a piece of legislation, not an act.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Internal company policy, Sarbanes-Oxley Act",
