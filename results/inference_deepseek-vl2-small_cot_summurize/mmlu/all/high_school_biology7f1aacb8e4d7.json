            "content": "To determine which statement is correct, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Most CO2 produced during cellular respiration is released from glycolysis.\n- Glycolysis is the first step of cellular respiration, where glucose is broken down into pyruvate, producing a small amount of ATP and NADH. However, CO2 is not produced in glycolysis. CO2 is primarily released during the citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle) and the electron transport chain. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\nB. Protons are pumped through ATP synthase by active transport.\n- ATP synthase is an enzyme complex that synthesizes ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate. It functions by using the proton gradient created by the electron transport chain. Protons flow back into the mitochondrial matrix through ATP synthase, which is a form of active transport. This statement is correct.\n\nC. The final electron acceptor of the electron transport chain is NAD+.\n- The electron transport chain (ETC) is a series of complexes that transfer electrons from NADH and FADH2 to oxygen, the final electron acceptor. This process generates a proton gradient used to synthesize ATP. NAD+ is not the final electron acceptor; it is the initial electron acceptor in the ETC. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\nD. ATP is formed because an endergonic reaction is coupled with an exergonic reaction.\n- ATP synthesis occurs through a process called chemiosmosis, where the energy from a proton gradient is used to drive the phosphorylation of ADP to ATP. This process involves an endergonic step (phosphorylation) and an exergonic step (ATP hydrolysis). This statement is correct.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the correct statements are B and D.",
