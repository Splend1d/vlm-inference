It is typically associated with stretching.\n   - **Compression**: This force acts perpendicular to the length of the branch, pushing it together. It is typically associated with squeezing.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Situation**:\n   - When you hang on the end of a branch, you are applying a force at the end of the branch.\n   - The branch bends, indicating that the force you apply is causing the branch to deform.\n\n3. **Direction of Forces**:\n   - The force you apply is at the end of the branch, which is the point where the branch is being bent.\n   - The top side of the branch is under the influence of the force you apply.\n\n4. **Determining the Type of Force**:\n   - Since the force is applied at the end of the branch and causes it to bend, it is pulling the branch apart.\n   - This pulling action is characteristic of tension.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The top side of the branch is under tension because the force applied causes the branch to stretch.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA.
