ECB (Electronic Codebook) - Each block of plaintext is encrypted independently.\nB. CFB (Cipher Feedback) - The ciphertext of the previous block is used as the plaintext for the next block.\nC. CBF (Cipher Block Chaining) - The ciphertext of the previous block is used as the plaintext for the next block, but the chaining is done in a different way than in CBC.\nD. CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) - The ciphertext of the previous block is XORed with the plaintext of the next block before encryption.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nC. CBF (Cipher Block Chaining)\n\nCBF is not a standard block cipher mode of operation. It is a mode of operation for the Data Encryption Standard (DES) and is not commonly used in modern block ciphers.",
