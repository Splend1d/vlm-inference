Examples include light waves, radio waves, and water waves. In these waves, the electric and magnetic fields oscillate perpendicular to the direction of wave travel.\n\nLongitudinal waves, on the other hand, are waves in which the oscillations are parallel to the direction of wave propagation. Examples include sound waves and some types of electromagnetic waves.\n\nAll waves can be polarized, but the property of polarization is specifically associated with transverse waves.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\nA. transverse waves",
