            "content": "To determine which substances have Lewis structures with unpaired electrons, we need to understand the concept of Lewis structures and the nature of free radicals.\n\nLewis structures are a way to represent the valence electrons of atoms in a molecule. They show how atoms are bonded to each other and the lone pairs of electrons that remain. In a Lewis structure, electrons are typically represented as dots around the symbols of the elements.\n\nFree radicals are molecules or atoms that have an unpaired electron in their valence shell. This unpaired electron makes the molecule highly reactive, as it seeks to pair with another electron to achieve a stable configuration.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Ionic compounds: These are formed by the electrostatic attraction between positively and negatively charged ions. They do not have unpaired electrons in their Lewis structures because they are composed of ions, which are neutral entities.\n\nB. Free radicals: As mentioned, free radicals have unpaired electrons in their valence shell, making them highly reactive. This is the correct answer.\n\nC. Resonance structures: These are different Lewis structures that represent the same molecule, showing the delocalization of electrons. While resonance structures can have unpaired electrons, they are not the same as free radicals, which specifically refer to molecules with unpaired electrons.\n\nD. Polar molecules: These have a distribution of electron density that is not symmetrical, leading to a dipole moment. While polar molecules can have unpaired electrons, the presence of unpaired electrons is a more specific characteristic of free radicals.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Free radicals.",
