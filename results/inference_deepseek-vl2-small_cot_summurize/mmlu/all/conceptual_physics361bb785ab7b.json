The weight of the crate is calculated as W = m * g, where m is the mass of the crate and g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.8 m/s\u00b2).\n\nFirst, calculate the weight of the crate:\nW = m * g\nW = 100 kg * 9.8 m/s\u00b2\nW = 980 N\n\nNext, calculate the work done:\nW = F * d\nW = 980 N * 2 m\nW = 1960 J\n\nTherefore, the work done on the crate is 1960 J, which is closest to option D.\n\nThe correct answer is: D",
