            "content": "To determine the effect of mass distribution on the rotational inertia of an object, we need to understand the concept of rotational inertia, also known as moment of inertia. Rotational inertia is a measure of an object's resistance to changes in its rotational motion. It depends on the distribution of mass relative to the axis of rotation.\n\nThe formula for rotational inertia \\( I \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ I = \\sum m_i r_i^2 \\]\n\nwhere \\( m_i \\) is the mass of each particle in the object, and \\( r_i \\) is the distance of each particle from the axis of rotation.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Near the rotational axis**: If most of the mass is located near the rotational axis, the distances \\( r_i \\) for many particles are small. This results in a smaller value of \\( r_i^2 \\), which means the rotational inertia \\( I \\) is smaller. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\nB. **Away from the axis**: If most of the mass is located away from the axis, the distances \\( r_i \\) for many particles are larger. This results in a larger value of \\( r_i^2 \\), which means the rotational inertia \\( I \\) is larger. Therefore, this option is correct.\n\nC. **On the rotational axis**: If all the mass is located on the rotational axis, the distances \\( r_i \\) for all particles are zero, which results in a rotational inertia \\( I \\) of zero. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\nD. **Off center**: If the mass is distributed off-center, the distances \\( r_i \\) vary, but typically, the effect of having mass off-center is to increase the rotational inertia compared to having mass on the axis, but not as much as having mass far from the axis. Therefore, this option is less correct than option B.\n\nThus, the correct answer is **B. away from the axis**.",
