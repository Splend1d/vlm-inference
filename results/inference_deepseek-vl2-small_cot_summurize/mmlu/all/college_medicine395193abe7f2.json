            "content": "To determine which repair mechanism is responsible for removing the incorrect base shortly after the RNA primer is removed, we need to understand the roles of each option:\n\nA. **DNA polymerase I**: This enzyme is involved in the removal of RNA primers and the addition of DNA nucleotides to fill in gaps. It does not directly correct base mismatches.\n\nB. **DNA polymerase III**: This enzyme is responsible for synthesizing new DNA strands during replication. It does not have a role in correcting base mismatches.\n\nC. **Mismatch repair mechanism**: This is a DNA repair process that identifies and corrects errors in the DNA sequence. It involves several proteins, including MutS, MutL, and MutH, which work together to recognize and excise mismatched bases. The mismatch repair mechanism is specifically designed to correct errors that occur during DNA replication.\n\nD. **Endonuclease repair**: This mechanism involves the removal of incorrect nucleotides by endonucleases. However, it is not typically involved in the immediate correction of base mismatches following the removal of an RNA primer.\n\nGiven the context of the question, the most likely repair mechanism to correct the base mismatch shortly after the RNA primer is removed is the **mismatch repair mechanism**. This is because it is specifically designed to address errors that occur during DNA replication, including those that might be present in the leading strand.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC.
