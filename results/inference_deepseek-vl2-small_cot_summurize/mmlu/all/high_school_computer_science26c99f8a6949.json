Allowing students to bring a graphing calculator from home is beneficial for students who have access to such devices, but it does not address the broader issue of digital divide, which involves access to technology and internet connectivity.\n\nB. Permitting students to bring a tablet computer to class is a step towards addressing the digital divide by providing students with access to technology. However, it still requires students to have personal devices, which may not be accessible to all students.\n\nC. Providing a laptop or tablet computer to all students enrolled at the school is the most effective policy in addressing the digital divide. This ensures that every student has access to technology, regardless of their financial situation or home environment. It helps level the playing field by providing equal opportunities for all students to engage with digital resources and participate in online learning.\n\nD. Recommending that students purchase computers with high processing speeds is not a practical solution for all students, as it places an additional financial burden on families. It does not ensure that all students have access to the necessary technology.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the most effective policy to address the digital divide is:\n\nC. A school provides a laptop or tablet computer to all students enrolled at the school.",
