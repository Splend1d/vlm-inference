Voter turnout is lower in midterm elections than it is in presidential elections.\n- This statement is true. Midterm elections typically have lower voter turnout compared to presidential elections. This is because midterm elections often focus on local and state issues rather than national ones, which can be less engaging for voters.\n\nB. Voters lacking party affiliation tend to vote less regularly than those with strong party affiliation.\n- This statement is true. Voters who do not strongly identify with a political party may be less likely to vote in every election, as they may not feel a strong connection to the issues or candidates.\n\nC. Young adults are less likely to vote than senior citizens.\n- This statement is true. Younger voters often have lower voter turnout rates compared to older voters. This could be due to a variety of factors, including lower engagement with politics, less access to voting, or simply less interest in the issues.\n\nD. Individuals are more likely to vote when they believe they know which candidate will win an election.\n- This statement is false. Research suggests that individuals are more likely to vote when they believe their vote will make a difference, regardless of who they think will win. This is known as the \" turnout effect.\" Voters are motivated to participate when they feel their vote can influence the outcome, rather than when they think the election is already decided.\n\nTherefore, the statement that is least true is D. Individuals are more likely to vote when they believe they know which candidate will win an election.",
