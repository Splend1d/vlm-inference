It is a measure of the instrument's ability to resolve two closely spaced values.\n\nB. **Accuracy**: This is the closeness of a measured value to the true or accepted value. It does not necessarily indicate the smallest change the instrument can detect.\n\nC. **Precision**: This refers to the consistency of repeated measurements. It does not indicate the smallest change the instrument can detect.\n\nD. **Sensitivity**: This is the ability of an instrument to detect a small change in a measured variable. It is related to the instrument's response to changes but does not specifically address the smallest change the instrument can respond to.\n\nGiven these definitions, the smallest change in a measured variable that an instrument will respond to is best described by:\n\nA. **Resolution**.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.
