It lives in a newly colonized habitat.\n- This statement is not necessarily true. The habitat where the organism lives does not directly relate to the reproductive strategy of giving birth to a single offspring.\n\nB. It is an aquatic organism.\n- This statement is not necessarily true. The habitat of the organism does not directly relate to the reproductive strategy of giving birth to a single offspring.\n\nC. It requires relatively high parental care of offspring.\n- This statement is likely true. The organism gives birth to only one offspring at a time, which suggests that the offspring would require significant care to ensure its survival. This is a common trait in many species that produce a single offspring, as the parents invest more resources into the survival of their single offspring.\n\nD. The age at which the offspring themselves can give birth is relatively young.\n- This statement is not necessarily true. The age at which offspring can give birth is not directly related to the reproductive strategy of giving birth to a single offspring.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that is probably true is:\n\nC. It requires relatively high parental care of offspring.",
