            "content": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Artificial Selection**: This is a process where humans actively select and breed animals with desirable traits. Over time, this can lead to significant improvements in the quality of meat by selecting for traits such as leanness, marbling, and growth rate.\n\nB. **Directional Selection**: This occurs when a population is selectively bred to favor one extreme of a trait, leading to a shift in the population's phenotype distribution. While it can lead to improvements, it is not the primary method used by cattle breeders to improve meat quality.\n\nC. **Stabilizing Selection**: This involves selecting individuals that are closer to the average phenotype, reducing variation within the population. It is not typically used to improve meat quality.\n\nD. **A and B**: This option suggests that both artificial selection and directional selection are used. While artificial selection is a primary method, directional selection is less common in cattle breeding for meat quality.\n\nGiven this analysis, the most accurate answer is:\n\nA. **Artificial Selection**\n\nArtificial selection is the primary method used by cattle breeders to improve the quality of meat over the years.",
