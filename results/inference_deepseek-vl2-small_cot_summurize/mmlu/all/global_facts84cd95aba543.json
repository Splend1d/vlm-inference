According to the CDC, in 2016, approximately 39.6% of adults in the United States were classified as overweight.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. 10% - This is too low, as it does not reflect the significant portion of the population that was overweight according to the CDC data.\n\nB. 20% - This is also too low, as it does not match the CDC's reported percentage of overweight adults.\n\nC. 40% - This is a plausible option, but it is still lower than the CDC's reported percentage.\n\nD. 80% - This is significantly higher than the CDC's reported percentage, making it an unlikely answer.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 40%, as it is the closest to the CDC's reported percentage of overweight adults in 2016.",
