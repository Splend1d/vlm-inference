Confidentiality: This is a fundamental security property that ensures that sensitive information is only accessible to those who are authorized to have access. It prevents unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of sensitive information.\n\nB. Availability: This property ensures that authorized users can access the system or data when they need to. It is about the system's ability to be available to users, and it is a critical aspect of system reliability and performance.\n\nD. Integrity: This property ensures that data is accurate and has not been altered or tampered with. It is about maintaining the trustworthiness of data and ensuring that it remains unchanged and reliable.\n\nC. Correctness: This property is not a classic security property. Correctness is more related to the accuracy and reliability of the system's operation, rather than the security of the data or information it processes. It is about ensuring that the system performs its intended functions correctly and without errors.\n\nIn summary, the classic security properties are confidentiality, availability, and integrity, while correctness is not a classic security property.",
