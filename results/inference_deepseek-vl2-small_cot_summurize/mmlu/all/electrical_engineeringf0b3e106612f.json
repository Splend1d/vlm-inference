We need to convert this to m\\(^2\\) to match the units of the radius. Since 1 m\\(^2\\) = 10000 cm\\(^2\\), we have:\n\\[ A = \\frac{2400 \\text{ cm}^2}{10000} = 0.24 \\text{ m}^2 \\]\n\nNow, substitute the values into the formula for the solid angle:\n\\[ \\Omega = \\frac{0.24 \\text{ m}^2}{0.6^2} = \\frac{0.24}{0.36} = \\frac{2}{5} \\]\n\nSo, the solid angle is \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\).\n\nThe answer is:\n\\[ \\text{D} \\]",
