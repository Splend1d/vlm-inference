            "content": "To solve the problem, we need to evaluate the truth of two statements about group theory.\n\n**Statement 1: The external direct product of cyclic groups is cyclic.**\n\nLet's consider two cyclic groups \\( G = \\langle a \\rangle \\) and \\( H = \\langle b \\rangle \\). The external direct product \\( G \\times H \\) is defined as:\n\\[ G \\times H = \\{ (g, h) \\mid g \\in G, h \\in H \\} \\]\n\nThe group operation in \\( G \\times H \\) is given by:\n\\[ (g_1, h_1) \\cdot (g_2, h_2) = (g_1 g_2, h_1 h_2) \\]\n\nSince \\( G \\) and \\( H \\) are cyclic, we can write:\n\\[ a^n = e \\quad \\text{and} \\quad b^m = e \\]\nwhere \\( e \\) is the identity element.\n\nNow, consider the element \\( (a^k, b^l) \\) in \\( G \\times H \\). We need to show that \\( (a^k, b^l) \\) generates \\( G \\times H \\).\n\nFirst, compute \\( a^k \\cdot b^l \\):\n\\[ a^k \\cdot b^l = (a^k)^m \\cdot (b^l)^n = e^m \\cdot e^n = e \\]\n\nSince \\( a^k \\cdot b^l = e \\), the element \\( (a^k, b^l) \\) is the identity element in \\( G \\times H \\). Therefore, \\( G \\times H \\) is cyclic and generated by \\( (a^k, b^l) \\).\n\nThus, Statement 1 is true.\n\n**Statement 2: The external direct product of \\( D_3 \\) and \\( D_4 \\) is isomorphic to \\( D_{12} \\).**\n\nFirst, let's understand the groups \\( D_3 \\) and \\( D_4 \\):\n- \\( D_3 \\) is the dihedral group of order 6, which has 3 rotations and 3 reflections.\n- \\( D_4 \\) is the dihedral group of order 8, which has 4 rotations and 4 reflections.\n\nThe external direct product \\( D_3 \\times D_4 \\) is:\n\\[ D_3 \\times D_4 = \\{ (r, s) \\mid r \\in D_3, s \\in D_4 \\} \\]\n\nThe group operation in \\( D_3 \\times D_4 \\) is given by:\n\\[ (r_1, s_1) \\cdot (r_2, s_2) = (r_1 r_2, s_1 s_2) \\]\n\nWe need to show that \\( D_3 \\times D_4 \\) is isomorphic to \\( D_{12} \\), which is the dihedral group of order 12.\n\nConsider the elements of \\( D_{12} \\):\n- There are 6 rotations and 6 reflections.\n\nWe need to check if \\( D_3 \\times D_4 \\) has the same structure as \\( D_{12} \\).\n\n1. **Identity and Inverses:**\n   - The identity element in \\( D_3 \\times D_4 \\) is \\( (e, e) \\).\n   - The inverse of \\( (r, s) \\) in \\( D_3 \\times D_4 \\) is \\( (r^{-1}, s^{-1}) \\).\n\n2. **Composition:**\n   - The composition of rotations and reflections in \\( D_3 \\times D_4 \\) must match the composition in \\( D_{12} \\).\n\nAfter checking the structure and composition, we find that \\( D_3 \\times D_4 \\) does not have the same structure as \\( D_{12} \\). Therefore, Statement 2 is false.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]",
