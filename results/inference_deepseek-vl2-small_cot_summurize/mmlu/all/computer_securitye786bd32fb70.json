They are typically used for services that require incoming connections, such as HTTP, FTP, or SSH.\n\n2. **Closed Ports**: These are ports that are closed and not listening for incoming connections. They are often used for services that do not require incoming connections, such as certain types of firewalls or network protocols.\n\n3. **Filtered Ports**: These are ports that are open but are not actively listening for incoming connections. They are often used for services that are configured to listen but are not actively accepting connections, such as certain types of firewalls or network protocols.\n\n4. **Unfiltered Ports**: These are ports that are open and actively listening for incoming connections. They are typically used for services that require incoming connections, such as HTTP, FTP, or SSH.\n\nGiven this understanding, let's analyze each option:\n\n- **Option A: Active, inactive, standby** - This does not match the terminology used by Nmap.\n\n- **Option B: Open, half-open, closed** - This is not a standard term used by Nmap.\n\n- **Option C: Open, filtered, unfiltered** - This matches the Nmap terminology. Open ports are actively listening, filtered ports are open but not actively listening, and unfiltered ports are actively listening.\n\n- **Option D: Active, closed, unused** - This does not match the terminology used by Nmap.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **Option C: Open, filtered, unfiltered**.",
