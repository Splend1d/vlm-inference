            "content": "To determine which statement is true about rectal bleeding, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. A painful digital examination suggests an anal fissure.\n- An anal fissure is a small tear in the lining of the anus, often causing pain during bowel movements. A painful digital examination is a common symptom of an anal fissure. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\nB. Bright red blood on the finger usually signifies a caecal lesion.\n- Bright red blood on the finger is typically associated with lower gastrointestinal bleeding, such as from the rectum or anus, rather than a caecal lesion, which is related to the cecum. This statement is false.\n\nC. Proctoscopy is of no value in the assessment of rectal bleeding.\n- Proctoscopy is a procedure that allows a doctor to visually examine the rectum and can help identify the source of rectal bleeding. It is a valuable tool in diagnosing rectal bleeding. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nD. Rectal cancer is the commonest cause of rectal bleeding.\n- While rectal cancer can cause rectal bleeding, it is not the most common cause. Other conditions, such as hemorrhoids, diverticulosis, and inflammatory bowel disease, are more frequently associated with rectal bleeding. This statement is false.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the correct answer is:\n\nA. A painful digital examination suggests an anal fissure.",
