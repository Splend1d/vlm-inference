            "content": "Let's analyze each option to determine which statement is true about Systemic Sclerosis:\n\nA. It affects males more than females: Systemic Sclerosis, also known as scleroderma, is a connective tissue disease that can affect both males and females. However, it is more common in females, with a female-to-male ratio of about 3:1. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\nB. If telangiectasia are seen this clinches the diagnosis: Telangiectasia, or the presence of visible blood vessels on the skin, is a common feature of Systemic Sclerosis. However, the presence of telangiectasia alone is not sufficient to confirm the diagnosis. Other clinical features, such as Raynaud's phenomenon, interstitial lung disease, and gastrointestinal involvement, are also important diagnostic criteria. Thus, this statement is incorrect.\n\nC. Arachnodactyly is a feature of the disease: Arachnodactyly refers to the thickening and hardening of the skin and fingers, which is a characteristic feature of Systemic Sclerosis. This feature is due to the overproduction of collagen in the skin and other tissues, leading to the characteristic \"hardening\" appearance. Therefore, this statement is correct.\n\nD. Patients have a beaked shaped nose and waxy skin: While Systemic Sclerosis can cause changes in the skin, such as the \"waxy\" appearance of the skin, it does not typically cause a beaked nose. Beaked nose is more commonly associated with conditions like Marfan syndrome. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Arachnodactyly is a feature of the disease.",
