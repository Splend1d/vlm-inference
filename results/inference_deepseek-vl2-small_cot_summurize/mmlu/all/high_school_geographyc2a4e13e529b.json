Central place functions are locations that serve a larger area and provide more specialized services. They are typically categorized into different orders based on the number of services they offer and the size of the area they serve.\n\nA. Winn-Dixie grocery store: This is a primary place function because it serves a relatively small area and provides basic goods and services.\n\nB. Mercedes-Benz dealership: This is a secondary place function. It serves a larger area than a primary place function and provides specialized services, such as selling and servicing vehicles.\n\nC. Shoe store: This is a primary place function. It serves a small area and provides basic goods and services.\n\nD. Family doctor: This is a tertiary place function. It serves a larger area than primary and secondary place functions and provides specialized services, such as medical care.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Family doctor, as it is a tertiary place function that serves a larger area and provides specialized services.",
