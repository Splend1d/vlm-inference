            "content": "To determine which structural feature of kangaroo-rat kidneys would allow them to concentrate urine more effectively than human kidneys, we need to understand the role of each component in the nephron.\n\n1. **Thicker Walls (Option A)**: While thicker walls might help in retaining water, they are not the primary factor in concentrating urine. The primary function of thicker walls is to withstand the osmotic pressure of concentrated urine, not to facilitate water reabsorption.\n\n2. **Shorter Loops of Henle (Option B)**: The loops of Henle are responsible for the countercurrent exchange mechanism that allows for the reabsorption of water and salts. A shorter loop of Henle would reduce the surface area available for this exchange, making it less efficient at concentrating urine.\n\n3. **Longer Loops of Henle (Option C)**: A longer loop of Henle increases the surface area available for countercurrent exchange. This allows for more efficient reabsorption of water and salts, which is crucial for concentrating urine. The longer loop also allows for a greater gradient of solute concentration, which is essential for the kidney's ability to concentrate urine.\n\n4. **Shorter Collecting Ducts (Option D)**: The collecting ducts are responsible for the final concentration of urine. While they play a role in the final stages of urine concentration, the primary factor for concentration is the reabsorption process occurring in the nephrons.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is **C. longer loops of Henle**. The longer loops of Henle in kangaroo-rat kidneys allow for more efficient water and salt reabsorption, which is essential for their ability to concentrate urine.",
