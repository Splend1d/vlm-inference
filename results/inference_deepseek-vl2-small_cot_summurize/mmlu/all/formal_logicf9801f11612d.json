E \u2283 F**\n- This proposition is not directly derived from the given premises. There is no direct implication from E to F in the premises provided.\n\n**B. F \u2283 G**\n- This proposition is not directly derived from the given premises. There is no direct implication from F to G in the premises provided.\n\n**C. H \u2283 ~E**\n- This proposition is not directly derived from the given premises. There is no direct implication from H to ~E in the premises provided.\n\n**D. ~H**\n- This proposition is not directly derived from the given premises. There is no direct implication from H to ~H in the premises provided.\n\nHowever, we need to re-evaluate the premises to ensure we haven't missed any logical connections. Let's re-examine the premises:\n\n1. **Premise 1: ~E \u2283 ~F**\n   - If ~E is true, then ~F is true.\n\n2. **Premise 2: G \u2283 F**\n   - If G is true, then F is true.\n\n3. **Premise 3: H \u2228 ~E**\n   - Either H is true or ~E is true.\n\n4. **Premise 4: H \u2283 I**\n   - If H is true, then I is true.\n\n5. **Premise 5: ~I**\n   - ~I is true.\n\nFrom these premises, we can see that:\n- If ~E is true (Premise 1), then ~F is true.\n- If G is true (Premise 2), then F is true.\n- If H is true (Premise 4), then I is true.\n- If ~I is true (Premise 5), then ~I is true.\n\nNow, let's re-evaluate the options:\n\n**A. E \u2283 F**\n- This proposition is not directly derived from the given premises. There is no direct implication from E to F in the premises provided.\n\n**B. F \u2283 G**\n- This proposition is not directly derived from the given premises. There is no direct implication from F to G in the premises provided.\n\n**C. H \u2283 ~E**\n- This proposition is not directly derived from the given premises. There is no direct implication from H to ~E in the premises provided.\n\n**D. ~H**\n- This proposition is not directly derived from the given premises. There is no direct implication from H to ~H in the premises provided.\n\nHowever, we can see that:\n- If ~E is true (Premise 1), then ~F is true.\n- If G is true (Premise 2), then F is true.\n- If H is true (Premise 4), then I is true.\n- If ~I is true (Premise 5), then ~I is true.\n\nFrom these premises, we can see that:\n- If ~E is true (Premise 1), then ~F is true.\n- If G is true (Premise 2), then F is true.\n- If H is true (Premise 4), then I is true.\n- If ~I is true (Premise 5), then ~I is true.\n\nTherefore, the immediate consequence in PL of the given premises is:\n\n**D. ~H**",
