According to the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 2.4 million people die each year from water-related diseases. This figure is based on data from 2019, which highlights the severe consequences of inadequate access to clean water and sanitation.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. 1.2 million: This number is significantly lower than the actual figure. It suggests a much smaller impact, which is not consistent with the known statistics.\n\nB. 2.4 million: This is the correct answer. It aligns with the WHO's reported statistics, indicating the substantial health risks associated with unsafe water.\n\nC. 3.6 million: This number is higher than the actual figure and does not correspond to the data provided by the WHO.\n\nD. 4.8 million: This is the highest option and is not supported by the WHO's data. It suggests a much larger impact than what is documented.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 2.4 million, reflecting the significant health risks posed by unsafe water globally.",
