            "content": "To determine when the telescope was invented by Galileo, we need to consider the historical context and the timeline of scientific advancements.\n\n1. **Historical Context**: The telescope was invented during the early 17th century, a period marked by significant scientific discoveries and technological innovations.\n\n2. **Galileo's Contribution**: Galileo Galilei, an Italian astronomer, physicist, and engineer, is credited with the invention of the telescope. He improved the design of the existing refracting telescope, making it more practical for astronomical observations.\n\n3. **Timeline of Events**:\n   - **1609**: This is the year when Galileo is believed to have invented the telescope. He used a refracting telescope to observe celestial bodies, which provided evidence for the Copernican heliocentric model of the solar system.\n   - **1409**: This date is too early for the invention of the telescope, as the technology did not exist at that time.\n   - **1509**: This is also too early, as the telescope was not invented until the 17th century.\n   - **1709**: This date is too late, as Galileo's telescope was invented in 1609.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Based on the historical evidence and the timeline of events, the correct answer is C. 1609.\n\nTherefore, the telescope was invented by Galileo in 1609.",
