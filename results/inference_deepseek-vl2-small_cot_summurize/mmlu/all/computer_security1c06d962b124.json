            "content": "Let's evaluate each statement based on the information provided in the paper \"SoK: SSL and HTTPS: Revisiting past challenges and evaluating certificates trust model enhancements\".\n\nA. Valid DV certificates provide more confidence to a user that she is connecting to the intended party than valid EV certificates.\n- This statement is false. Domain Validated (DV) certificates are issued by a Certificate Authority (CA) that verifies only the domain ownership, not the identity of the entity. Extended Validation (EV) certificates, on the other hand, provide a higher level of validation, including identity verification, which can provide more confidence to users that they are connecting to the intended party.\n\nB. OCSP stapling allows a server to prove to a browser that its certificate hasn\u2019t been revoked.\n- This statement is true. OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol) stapling is a technique that allows a server to prove to a browser that its certificate has not been revoked by sending the certificate and its revocation status directly to the browser, rather than relying on the CA's OCSP server.\n\nC. DANE makes it difficult for an adversary to launch a SSL stripping attack.\n- This statement is true. DANE (DNSSEC-based Authentication of Named Entities) is a protocol that uses DNS to provide authentication of domain names, which can help prevent SSL stripping attacks by ensuring that the domain name is correctly resolved and authenticated.\n\nD. Server key-pinning makes it harder for an adversary to convince a CA to mint a certificate for a site and launch an MITM attack on that site.\n- This statement is true. Server key-pinning is a technique that allows a server to bind a specific key to a certificate, making it more difficult for an adversary to launch a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack by convincing a CA to mint a certificate for a site and then using that certificate to intercept communications.\n\nIn conclusion, the false statement is A. Valid DV certificates provide more confidence to a user that she is connecting to the intended party than valid EV certificates.",
