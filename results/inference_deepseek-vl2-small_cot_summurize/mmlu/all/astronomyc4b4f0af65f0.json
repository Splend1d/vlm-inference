Meteorites are primarily composed of rock and metal, and they do not provide direct evidence about the composition of the early solar system. The early solar system was primarily made up of hydrogen and helium gas, which is a fact known from other sources, such as the Big Bang theory and the study of stellar spectra.\n\nB. Meteorites are fragments of asteroids and comets that have broken apart and entered Earth's atmosphere. They are not older than the comets and planets. In fact, meteorites are remnants from the formation of the solar system, which is much older than the comets and planets.\n\nC. Meteorites contain minerals and elements that are similar to those found in the solar system's early material. By studying these meteorites, scientists can determine the age of the solar system. The isotopic dating of meteorites, particularly those with a high concentration of certain elements like lead-206, has provided evidence that the solar system is approximately 4.6 billion years old.\n\nD. The solar system currently has 8 planets, not 10. This option is incorrect.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the correct answer is:\n\nC. They reveal that the age of the solar system is approximately 4.6 billion years.",
