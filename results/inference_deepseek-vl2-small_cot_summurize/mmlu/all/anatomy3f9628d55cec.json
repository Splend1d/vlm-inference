It is a protective passageway that houses the spinal cord, which is a major component of the central nervous system.\n\n2. **Anatomical Directions**:\n   - **Caudal**: This term refers to the back or posterior side of the body.\n   - **Dorsal**: This term refers to the back or posterior side of the body, specifically the upper part.\n   - **Frontal**: This term refers to the front or anterior side of the body.\n   - **Transverse**: This term refers to a horizontal or side-to-side orientation.\n\n3. **Spinal Cord Orientation**: The spinal cord runs longitudinally through the vertebral column. It is positioned in the midline of the back, which corresponds to the dorsal side of the body.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Given the above understanding, the spinal canal is located on the dorsal side of the body.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. dorsal**.",
