However, as the industrial and service sectors grew, the share of GDP attributed to agriculture decreased.\n\n2. **Data Analysis**: According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), in 2015, agriculture accounted for approximately 1% of the total US GDP. This figure reflects the ongoing shift in the economy towards more service-oriented and industrial activities.\n\n3. **Economic Shifts**: Over the decades, the US economy has transitioned from a predominantly agricultural base to one that is more diversified, with significant contributions from technology, finance, and manufacturing.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Given the historical trends and the data from 2015, agriculture's share of GDP was about 1%.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 1%",
