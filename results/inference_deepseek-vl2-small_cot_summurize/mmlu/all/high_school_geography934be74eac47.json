It also experiences uneven economic development, with significant disparities between urban and rural areas. Additionally, Latin America has a history of rural-to-urban migration flows, as people move from rural areas to cities in search of better economic opportunities.\n\nGiven this analysis, the combination of Spanish colonial architecture, uneven economic development, and rural-to-urban migration flows is most commonly found in Latin America.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.
