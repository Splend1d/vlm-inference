            "content": "To determine which group of animals developed lung tissue adequate for respiratory support without supplementary gas exchange organs, we need to consider the evolutionary history and physiological adaptations of each group.\n\nA. **Amphibians**: Amphibians, such as frogs and salamanders, have lungs that are primarily used for respiration. However, they also have a secondary respiratory system involving their skin, which is particularly important for gas exchange in aquatic environments. This dual system allows them to extract oxygen from water, but it does not mean they developed lung tissue that is solely sufficient for respiratory needs without supplementary organs.\n\nB. **Reptiles**: Reptiles, including snakes, lizards, and turtles, have lungs that are adapted for terrestrial life. They have a more efficient respiratory system compared to amphibians, with a larger surface area for gas exchange. However, reptiles still rely on their skin for some gas exchange, especially in water, and do not have a fully independent lung system that can sustain life without supplementary organs.\n\nC. **Mammals**: Mammals, such as humans, dogs, and whales, have lungs that are highly efficient for extracting oxygen from the air. Unlike reptiles, mammals have a fully developed lung system that can sustain life without relying on supplementary organs like the skin for gas exchange. This is a significant evolutionary advancement, allowing mammals to thrive in a wide range of environments, including those where oxygen levels are low.\n\nD. **Trematoda (Flukes)**: Trematodes are parasitic flatworms, and they do not have lungs or a respiratory system. They rely on a simple diffusion process for gas exchange, which is not suitable for supporting life in environments with low oxygen levels.\n\nGiven this analysis, the group of animals that developed lung tissue adequate for respiratory support without supplementary gas exchange organs is:\n\nC. **Mammals**",
