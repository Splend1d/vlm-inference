The population refers to the entire set of individuals or items that are of interest for the study.\n\nB. The population can be infinite.\n- This statement is true. In many cases, the population can be infinite, such as all individuals in a country or all items in a universe.\n\nC. In theory, the sample could be larger than the population.\n- This statement is true. In theory, a sample can be larger than the population, especially if the sample is a subset of the population.\n\nD. A random sample is one where each individual item from the population is equally likely to be drawn.\n- This statement is false. A random sample is one where each individual item from the population has an equal chance of being selected. However, it does not mean that each item is equally likely to be drawn. The probability of selection depends on the sample size and the population size.\n\nTherefore, the false statement is D. A random sample is one where each individual item from the population is equally likely to be drawn.",
