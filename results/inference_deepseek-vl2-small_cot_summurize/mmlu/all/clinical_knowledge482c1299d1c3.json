            "content": "To determine the correct answer, we need to understand the characteristics of fast-twitch fibres. Fast-twitch fibres are a type of muscle fibre that are primarily involved in activities requiring quick, powerful bursts of energy. These fibres are essential for sports that require short, intense efforts, such as sprinting or weightlifting.\n\n1. **Mitochondria**: Fast-twitch fibres have a relatively small number of mitochondria. This is because they are designed for short, high-intensity activities. The mitochondria in fast-twitch fibres are highly efficient at producing ATP quickly, which is crucial for the rapid energy demands of these fibres.\n\n2. **ATPase Activity**: Fast-twitch fibres have high ATPase activity. ATPase is the enzyme responsible for breaking down ATP to ADP and inorganic phosphate, releasing energy that can be used by the muscle. High ATPase activity allows fast-twitch fibres to rapidly replenish ATP, which is essential for sustaining the quick bursts of energy required in their function.\n\nGiven these characteristics, the correct answer is:\n\nC. a relatively small number of mitochondria and high ATPase activity.",
