            "content": "To determine which traits are affected by more than one gene, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Heterozygous traits**: These traits are influenced by two different alleles at a single gene locus. For example, sickle cell anemia is a heterozygous trait, where one allele is normal and the other is the mutated allele causing the disease. Therefore, heterozygous traits are indeed affected by more than one gene.\n\nB. **Pleiotropic traits**: These traits are influenced by a single gene that affects multiple phenotypic traits. For example, the gene for Huntington's disease affects motor skills, cognitive abilities, and emotional stability. Since a single gene can influence multiple traits, pleiotropic traits are affected by more than one gene.\n\nC. **Polygenic traits**: These traits are influenced by multiple genes, each contributing a small effect to the overall phenotype. Examples include height, skin color, and eye color. Since multiple genes contribute to polygenic traits, they are indeed affected by more than one gene.\n\nD. **Blended alleles**: This term is not commonly used in genetics to describe traits affected by multiple genes. It might be a misunderstanding or a typo. Typically, blended alleles refer to alleles that combine different alleles from different genes, but this is not a standard term in genetics.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the traits that are affected by more than one gene are:\n\n- A. Heterozygous traits\n- B. Pleiotropic traits\n- C. Polygenic traits\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A, B, and C.",
