            "content": "Induction heating takes place in conducting materials which may be either magnetic or non-magnetic materials. This is because induction heating relies on the electromagnetic induction principle, where an alternating current (AC) is passed through a conductor, creating a changing magnetic field. This changing magnetic field induces an electric current in the conductor, which then generates heat through resistive heating. The key requirement for induction heating is that the material must be conductive, allowing the current to flow and the magnetic field to be generated.",
