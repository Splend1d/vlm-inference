This is because the derivative at a local maximum gives the slope of the tangent line, which is zero at the maximum point.\n- Therefore, if \\( f \\) has a local maximum, \\( f'(x) \\) must exist and equal 0 at that point.\n\nThus, Statement 1 is true.\n\n**Statement 2:** There exist non-constant continuous maps from \\( \\mathbb{R} \\) to \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\).\n\n- The set \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\) of rational numbers is countable, but \\( \\mathbb{R} \\) is uncountable.\n- A continuous map from an uncountable set to a countable set is impossible because the image of the map must be countable, but the codomain is uncountable.\n\nThus, Statement 2 is false.\n\nGiven the analysis:\n- Statement 1 is true.\n- Statement 2 is false.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nB.
