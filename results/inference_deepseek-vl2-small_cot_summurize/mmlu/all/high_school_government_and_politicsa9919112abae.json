The president's nominees must be approved by the Senate before taking office.\n- This is true. The Senate has the power to approve or reject presidential nominees, including those for the Supreme Court, federal courts, and executive positions.\n\nB. Two-thirds of the Senate must approve presidentially negotiated treaties.\n- This is true. The Senate has the power to ratify treaties, and a two-thirds majority is required for approval.\n\nC. The president can override a congressional veto and pass laws.\n- This is true. The president can veto legislation, but Congress can override the veto with a two-thirds majority in both the House and the Senate.\n\nD. Congress can override a presidential veto.\n- This is false. The president has the power to veto legislation, but Congress cannot override a presidential veto. The only way to override a veto is through a two-thirds majority vote in both the House and the Senate.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Congress cannot override a presidential veto.",
