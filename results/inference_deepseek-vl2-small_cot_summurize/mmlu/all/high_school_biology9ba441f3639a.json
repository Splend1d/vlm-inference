            "content": "To determine the type of speciation illustrated by this example, let's analyze the given information step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial Observation**: The researcher notices a new variant with a distinct phenotype after a few generations. This indicates that the new variant is genetically different from the original phenotype.\n\n2. **Breeding with Original Phenotype**: When the researcher attempts to breed the original phenotype with the new variant, no offspring are produced. This suggests that the new variant is not capable of producing offspring with the original phenotype, indicating a reproductive barrier.\n\n3. **Breeding of New Variants**: However, when the researcher breeds the new variants, offspring that look like the new variant are produced. This implies that the new variant can produce offspring with other new variants, indicating that the new variant is capable of interbreeding with other new variants.\n\n4. **Species Definition**: In the context of speciation, a species is typically defined as a group of organisms that can interbreed and produce fertile offspring. The fact that the new variant can produce offspring with other new variants but not with the original phenotype suggests that the new variant has become a separate species.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The scenario described is characteristic of sympatric speciation, where a new species evolves from a single ancestral species while inhabiting the same geographic area. The reproductive isolation between the new variant and the original phenotype, along with the ability to interbreed with other new variants, supports this conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.
