            "content": "To understand why jovian planets have a \"squashed\" appearance, we need to consider the forces acting on these massive planets.\n\nJovian planets, such as Jupiter and Saturn, are characterized by their large size and rapid rotation. The rapid rotation of these planets causes a centrifugal force that acts outward on the material near the equator. This centrifugal force is similar to the force that causes a figure skater to spin faster by pulling their arms inward.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Their large systems of moons and rings gravitationally attract the mass around the equator more.\n- While moons and rings can influence the planet's shape, they do not cause the equatorial bulge. The bulge is primarily due to the planet's rotation, not the gravitational pull of its moons or rings.\n\nB. They are much more massive than the terrestrial planets.\n- Mass does not directly cause the equatorial bulge. The bulge is a result of the planet's rotation, not its mass.\n\nC. Their rapid rotation flings the mass near the equator outward.\n- This is the correct explanation. The rapid rotation of jovian planets creates a centrifugal force that pushes the material outward at the equator, causing the planet to bulge.\n\nD. Their internal heat sources exert a pressure against the sides of the planets.\n- While internal heat can affect a planet's structure, it does not cause the equatorial bulge. The bulge is due to the planet's rotation, not internal heat.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Their rapid rotation flings the mass near the equator outward.",
