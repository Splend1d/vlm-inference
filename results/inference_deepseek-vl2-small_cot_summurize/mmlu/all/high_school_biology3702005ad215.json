            "content": "To determine which statement is NOT correct, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Innate immunity, also known as the adaptive immune response, relies on circulating phagocytes engulfing foreign substances.\n- This statement is incorrect. Innate immunity is the body's first line of defense and does not rely on circulating phagocytes. Instead, it involves physical barriers, such as the skin and mucous membranes, and cellular components like macrophages and neutrophils that recognize and destroy pathogens.\n\nB. Adaptive immunity is a slower response than innate immunity.\n- This statement is correct. Adaptive immunity, or the immune response, is slower than innate immunity because it involves the activation of specific immune cells and the production of antibodies, which take time to develop and respond to specific antigens.\n\nC. Innate immunity activates a humoral response.\n- This statement is incorrect. Innate immunity does not activate a humoral response. The humoral response is a component of adaptive immunity, where antibodies are produced by B cells to neutralize pathogens.\n\nD. Dendritic cells are antigen presenting cells.\n- This statement is correct. Dendritic cells are specialized cells that play a crucial role in the immune system by capturing antigens and presenting them to T cells, thus initiating the adaptive immune response.\n\nBased on the analysis, the incorrect statement is:\n\nA. Innate immunity, also known as the adaptive immune response, relies on circulating phagocytes engulfing foreign substances.",
