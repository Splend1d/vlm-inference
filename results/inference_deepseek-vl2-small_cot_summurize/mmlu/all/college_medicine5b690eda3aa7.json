            "content": "To determine the pKb of a very weak base, we need to understand the relationship between the pKb and the pOH of a solution.\n\n1. **Understanding pKb and pOH**:\n   - The pKb of a base is the negative logarithm of the base dissociation constant (Kb). It indicates the strength of the base; a lower pKb means a stronger base.\n   - The pOH of a solution is the negative logarithm of the hydroxide ion concentration (OH\u207b). It indicates the basicity of the solution.\n\n2. **Relationship between pKb and pOH**:\n   - For a weak base, the relationship between pKb and pOH is given by the equation:\n     \\[\n     \\text{pKb} + \\text{pOH} = 14\n     \\]\n   - This equation arises because the sum of the concentrations of the conjugate acid and base in a solution at equilibrium is 1.\n\n3. **Analyzing the options**:\n   - **Option A: Equal to the pOH** - This is incorrect because the pKb and pOH are related through the equation \\(\\text{pKb} + \\text{pOH} = 14\\).\n   - **Option B: Higher than the pOH** - This is incorrect because the pKb is always less than the pOH for a weak base.\n   - **Option C: Lower than the pOH** - This is correct because the pKb is always less than the pOH for a weak base.\n   - **Option D: Near 7 at 25\u00baC** - This is incorrect because the pKb is not typically near 7 for a weak base.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - For a very weak base, the pKb is lower than the pOH.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **C. Lower than the pOH**.",
