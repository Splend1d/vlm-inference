            "content": "To determine which statement about variation is true, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **All phenotypic variation is the result of genotypic variation.**\n\n   - This statement is incorrect. While genotypic variation can lead to phenotypic variation, not all phenotypic variation is due to genotypic variation. Phenotypic variation can also result from environmental factors, gene-gene interactions, and gene-environment interactions.\n\nB. **All genetic variation produces phenotypic variation.**\n\n   - This statement is incorrect. Genetic variation refers to the differences in DNA sequences among individuals. However, not all genetic variations result in phenotypic variation. Some genetic variations may be silent, meaning they do not affect the phenotype.\n\nC. **All nucleotide variability results in neutral variation.**\n\n   - This statement is incorrect. Neutral variation refers to changes in alleles that do not affect the organism's fitness. However, nucleotide variability can lead to both neutral and non-neutral variations. Non-neutral variations can affect fitness and may be subject to natural selection.\n\nD. **All new alleles are the result of nucleotide variability.**\n\n   - This statement is correct. New alleles arise due to mutations, which are changes in the nucleotide sequence of DNA. These mutations can occur spontaneously or be induced by environmental factors.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. All new alleles are the result of nucleotide variability.",
