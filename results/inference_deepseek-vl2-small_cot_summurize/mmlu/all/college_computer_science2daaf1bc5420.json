We can start by assuming that T(n) = an^2 + bn + c, where a, b, and c are constants.\n\nSubstituting this into the recurrence relation, we get:\n\nT(n + 1) = 3n + T(n)\na(n + 1)^2 + b(n + 1) + c = 3n + an^2 + bn + c\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\na(n^2 + 2n + 1) + b(n + 1) + c = 3n + an^2 + bn + c\nan^2 + 2an + a + bn + b + c = 3n + an^2 + bn + c\n\nComparing coefficients, we get:\n\na = 0\n2a + b = 3\nb + c = 0\n\nSolving these equations, we get:\n\na = 0\nb = 3\nc = 0\n\nSo, T(n) = 3n.\n\nNow, we can see that the order of growth of T(n) is O(n), since the coefficient of n is 3, which is a constant.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. \u0398(n)",
