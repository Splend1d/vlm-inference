            "content": "To determine the wavelength at which the thermal spectrum of a body with a surface temperature close to 300 K reaches a maximum, we need to understand the relationship between temperature and the peak wavelength of a blackbody spectrum.\n\n1. **Understanding Blackbody Radiation**: A blackbody is an idealized physical body that absorbs all incident electromagnetic radiation, regardless of frequency or angle of incidence. It then re-radiates energy perfectly according to its temperature. The spectrum of a blackbody is characterized by a peak wavelength, which is inversely proportional to its temperature.\n\n2. ** Wien's Displacement Law**: This law states that the peak wavelength (\\(\\lambda_{\\text{max}}\\)) of a blackbody's radiation is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\lambda_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{b}{T}\n   \\]\n   where \\(b\\) is Wien's displacement constant (\\(2.897 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{m K}\\)) and \\(T\\) is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n3. **Calculating the Peak Wavelength**: For a body with a temperature of 300 K:\n   \\[\n   \\lambda_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{2.897 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{m K}}{300 \\, \\text{K}} = 9.6567 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{m}\n   \\]\n   Converting meters to millimeters:\n   \\[\n   \\lambda_{\\text{max}} = 9.6567 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{m} \\times 1000 = 9.6567 \\times 10^{-4} \\, \\text{mm}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The peak wavelength of the thermal spectrum for a body with a surface temperature of 300 K is approximately 9.66 mm.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 10 mm",
