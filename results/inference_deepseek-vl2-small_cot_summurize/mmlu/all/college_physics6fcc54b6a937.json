The orbital velocity \\( v \\) is constant for both satellites, as it depends only on the distance from the Earth and not on the mass of the satellite.\n\nThe ratio of the angular momentum of A to the angular momentum of B is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{L_A}{L_B} = \\frac{m \\cdot 2vr}{m \\cdot vr} = \\frac{2v}{v} = 2 \\]\n\nSo, the ratio of the angular momentum of A to the angular momentum of B is 2.\n\nThe answer is:\n\\[ B \\]",
