Let's break down the information given and solve the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Total number of soccer balls**: Coach Wu has a total of 30 soccer balls.\n\n2. **Number of white soccer balls**: There are 9 white soccer balls.\n\n3. **Number of soccer balls of other colors**: The remaining soccer balls are one of three different colors: blue, pink, or green. Since there are 30 soccer balls in total and 9 are white, the number of soccer balls of other colors is:\n   \\[\n   30 - 9 = 21\n   \\]\n\n4. **Equal number of blue, pink, and green balls**: The remaining 21 soccer balls are divided equally among three colors: blue, pink, and green. Therefore, the number of soccer balls of each color is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{21}{3} = 7\n   \\]\n\n5. **Number of green soccer balls**: Since there are 7 soccer balls of each color and we are interested in the number of green soccer balls, the number of green soccer balls is:\n   \\[\n   7\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of green soccer balls that Coach Wu has is $\\boxed{7}$.",
