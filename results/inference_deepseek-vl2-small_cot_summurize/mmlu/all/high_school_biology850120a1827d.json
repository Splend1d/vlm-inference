The appendix can be surgically removed with no immediate ill effects.\n- This statement suggests that the appendix still has some functional role, as its removal does not cause immediate harm. This implies that the appendix might have some residual function, which contradicts the idea of it being completely vestigial.\n\nB. The appendix might have been larger in fossil hominids.\n- This statement suggests that the appendix might have had a functional role in the past, which could indicate that it was not completely vestigial. However, it does not directly challenge the idea that the appendix is currently non-functional.\n\nC. The appendix has a substantial amount of defensive lymphatic tissue.\n- This statement directly challenges the idea that the appendix is vestigial by suggesting that it still has a role in the immune system. The presence of lymphatic tissue indicates that the appendix might have some function, which contradicts the idea of it being completely non-functional.\n\nD. Individuals with a larger-than-average appendix leave fewer offspring than those with a below-average-sized appendix.\n- This statement suggests a correlation between appendix size and reproductive success, which could imply a functional role in reproduction. However, it does not directly challenge the idea that the appendix is completely vestigial.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the statement that most detracts from the claim that the human appendix is a completely vestigial organ is:\n\nC. The appendix has a substantial amount of defensive lymphatic tissue.",
