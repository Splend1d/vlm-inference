It does not apply to natural selection processes in wildlife.\n\nB. **Directional selection**: This occurs when one extreme phenotype is favored over others, leading to a shift in the population's phenotype distribution. In this case, the extreme is having fewer or more eggs than the average, which is not the focus of directional selection.\n\nC. **Stabilizing selection**: This type of selection favors the average phenotype, reducing the frequency of extreme phenotypes. In the context of the Swiss starling, stabilizing selection would favor the average clutch size of four to five eggs, as extreme clutch sizes (fewer or more) are less common and thus less fit.\n\nD. **Disruptive selection**: This occurs when two extreme phenotypes are favored over the average, leading to a split in the population. This does not apply to the scenario where the average clutch size is favored.\n\nGiven the analysis, the term that best describes the situation is **C. stabilizing selection**, as it favors the average clutch size, reducing the frequency of extreme clutch sizes.",
