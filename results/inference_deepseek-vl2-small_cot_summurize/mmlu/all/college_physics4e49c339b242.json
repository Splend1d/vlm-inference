            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to use Newton's second law of motion, which states that the force acting on an object is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by its acceleration. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n\n\\[ F = ma \\]\n\nwhere \\( F \\) is the force, \\( m \\) is the mass, and \\( a \\) is the acceleration.\n\nGiven:\n- The mass of object B is twice the mass of object A, so \\( m_B = 2m_A \\).\n- The acceleration of object B is twice that of object A, so \\( a_B = 2a_A \\).\n\nWe need to find the relationship between the forces \\( F_A \\) and \\( F_B \\).\n\nFirst, let's express the acceleration of object A in terms of \\( a_A \\):\n\\[ a_A = \\frac{F_A}{m_A} \\]\n\nSince \\( a_B = 2a_A \\), we can substitute \\( a_A \\) into the equation for \\( a_B \\):\n\\[ a_B = 2 \\left( \\frac{F_A}{m_A} \\right) = \\frac{2F_A}{m_A} \\]\n\nNow, using the relationship \\( m_B = 2m_A \\), we can substitute \\( m_B \\) into the equation for \\( a_B \\):\n\\[ a_B = \\frac{2F_A}{2m_A} = \\frac{F_A}{m_A} \\]\n\nThis shows that the acceleration of object B is the same as the acceleration of object A.\n\nNext, we need to find the relationship between the forces \\( F_A \\) and \\( F_B \\). Since \\( a_B = a_A \\), we can use the equation \\( F = ma \\) to find the relationship between \\( F_A \\) and \\( F_B \\).\n\nFor object A:\n\\[ F_A = m_A \\cdot a_A = m_A \\cdot \\frac{F_A}{m_A} = F_A \\]\n\nFor object B:\n\\[ F_B = m_B \\cdot a_B = 2m_A \\cdot \\frac{F_A}{m_A} = 2F_A \\]\n\nTherefore, the force \\( F_B \\) is twice the force \\( F_A \\).\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]",
