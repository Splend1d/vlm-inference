            "content": "To perform a polymerase chain reaction (P C R), the following are required:\n\nA. Reverse transcriptase: This enzyme is not required for P C R. Reverse transcriptase is used in reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR), which is a technique used to convert RNA into DNA. In P C R, DNA polymerase is used to synthesize new DNA strands from a DNA template.\n\nB. A vacuum chamber: A vacuum chamber is not required for P C R. P C R is typically performed in a thermal cycler, which is a device that can control the temperature and cycling of the reaction. The thermal cycler is used to denature the DNA, anneal primers, and extend the DNA strands.\n\nC. Primers complementary to certain portions of the DNA: This is a required component of P C R. Primers are short DNA sequences that are complementary to specific portions of the target DNA. They are used to initiate the synthesis of new DNA strands by providing a starting point for the DNA polymerase.\n\nD. DNA ligase: This enzyme is not required for P C R. DNA ligase is used to join DNA fragments together, which is not necessary in P C R. In P C R, the DNA polymerase synthesizes new DNA strands by adding nucleotides to the 3' end of the growing DNA strand.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Primers complementary to certain portions of the DNA.",
