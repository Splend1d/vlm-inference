However, the color of the petal is determined by the pigments it contains, not by absorbing light.\n\nB. **Reflects red**: This means the petal reflects red light. This is the correct answer because the color of the petal is determined by the pigments it contains, and these pigments reflect red light.\n\nC. **Emits red**: This means the petal emits red light. This is incorrect because the petal does not emit light; it reflects light.\n\nD. **Transmits red**: This means the petal transmits red light. This is incorrect because the petal does not transmit light; it reflects light.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. **reflects red**.",
