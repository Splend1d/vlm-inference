            "content": "To determine which statement is true about haemorrhoids, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Bleeding haemorrhoids lead to melaena per rectum (PR):**\n   - Melaena per rectum refers to black, tarry stools. This is typically associated with upper gastrointestinal bleeding, not haemorrhoids. Haemorrhoids usually cause bleeding that is bright red and occurs in the toilet. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\nB. **Pregnancy is a predisposing factor in causing haemorrhoids:**\n   - Pregnancy can increase pressure in the pelvic area, which may lead to the development of haemorrhoids. This is due to the increased blood volume and pressure on the rectal veins. Thus, this statement is true.\n\nC. **Bleeding from first degree haemorrhoids is associated with pain:**\n   - First degree haemorrhoids are usually painless. They are often identified by the presence of bright red blood on the toilet paper. Pain is more commonly associated with second degree or third degree haemorrhoids. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\nD. **Second degree haemorrhoids cannot be returned to the anal canal:**\n   - Second degree haemorrhoids are prolapsed, meaning they can be pushed back into the anal canal. They are not fixed in place and can be manually returned. This statement is incorrect.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Pregnancy is a predisposing factor in causing haemorrhoids.",
