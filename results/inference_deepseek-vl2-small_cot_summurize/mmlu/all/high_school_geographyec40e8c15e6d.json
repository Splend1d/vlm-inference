            "content": "To determine which crop began the Third Agricultural Revolution, we need to understand the historical context and the key crops involved in each agricultural revolution.\n\n1. **First Agricultural Revolution**: This began around 10,000 years ago and was characterized by the domestication of plants and animals. Crops like wheat, barley, and rice were domesticated, leading to the establishment of permanent settlements and the development of agriculture.\n\n2. **Second Agricultural Revolution**: This occurred around 1000 BCE and was marked by the use of iron tools and the development of the plow. This revolution allowed for more efficient farming and the cultivation of larger areas of land.\n\n3. **Third Agricultural Revolution**: This began in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It was characterized by the introduction of new technologies and scientific methods in agriculture. The Green Revolution, which began in the 1940s, was a significant part of this revolution.\n\n4. **Green Revolution**: This was a period of significant agricultural development that focused on increasing food production through the use of high-yield crop varieties, chemical fertilizers, and improved irrigation techniques. The Green Revolution was particularly notable for its impact on wheat production.\n\nGiven this context, the crop that began the Third Agricultural Revolution is the one that was significantly advanced during this period.\n\n- **A. Rice**: While rice was a major crop in the Green Revolution, it was not the primary crop that began this revolution.\n- **B. Wheat**: Wheat was a major crop during the Green Revolution and was significantly improved through this period.\n- **C. Barley**: Barley was also part of the Green Revolution, but it was not the primary crop.\n- **D. Millet**: Millet was not a major focus of the Green Revolution.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. Wheat**. The Green Revolution, which began in the late 19th century, was primarily driven by the development and widespread adoption of high-yield wheat varieties.",
