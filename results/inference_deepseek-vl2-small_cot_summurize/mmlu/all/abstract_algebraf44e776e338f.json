            "content": "To factor the polynomial \\(x^4 + 4\\) into linear factors in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_5[x]\\), we can use the following approach:\n\n1. Notice that \\(x^4 + 4\\) can be written as \\((x^2)^2 + 2^2\\).\n2. This resembles the form of a sum of squares, which can be factored using the difference of squares formula: \\(a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)\\).\n3. In this case, \\(a = x^2\\) and \\(b = 2\\).\n4. Applying the difference of squares formula, we get:\n\\[ x^4 + 4 = (x^2 - 2)(x^2 + 2) \\]\n\nNow, we need to factor \\(x^2 - 2\\) and \\(x^2 + 2\\) further.\n\n1. Notice that \\(x^2 - 2\\) can be written as \\((x - \\sqrt{2})(x + \\sqrt{2})\\).\n2. Similarly, \\(x^2 + 2\\) can be written as \\((x - i)(x + i)\\), where \\(i\\) is the imaginary unit.\n\nHowever, since we are working in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_5[x]\\), we need to consider the factors modulo 5.\n\n1. In \\(\\mathbb{Z}_5\\), the square root of 2 is not an integer, so we cannot factor \\(x^2 - 2\\) further.\n2. Similarly, the square root of 2 is not an integer in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_5\\), so we cannot factor \\(x^2 + 2\\) further.\n\nTherefore, the factorization of \\(x^4 + 4\\) in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_5[x]\\) is:\n\\[ (x - \\sqrt{2})(x + \\sqrt{2})(x - i)(x + i) \\]\n\nHowever, since we are working in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_5\\), we need to consider the factors modulo 5.\n\n1.
