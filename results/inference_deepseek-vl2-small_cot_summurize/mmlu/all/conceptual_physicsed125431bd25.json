            "content": "To determine which of these changes when light refracts in passing from one medium to another, we need to understand the concept of refraction. Refraction is the bending of light as it passes from one medium to another with a different density. This bending occurs because light travels at different speeds in different media.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Speed only: This option suggests that only the speed of light changes when it refracts. While it is true that the speed of light changes when it moves from one medium to another, this is not the only change that occurs.\n\nB. Wavelength only: This option suggests that only the wavelength of light changes. While the wavelength can change due to the change in speed, it is not the only change.\n\nC. Both speed and wavelength: This option suggests that both the speed and wavelength of light change when it refracts. This is correct. When light passes from one medium to another, its speed changes due to the difference in refractive indices, and its wavelength can also change if the medium has a different refractive index.\n\nD. Neither of these: This option suggests that neither speed nor wavelength changes. This is incorrect because both speed and wavelength can change when light refracts.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Both speed and wavelength.",
