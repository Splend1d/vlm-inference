(\u2203x)[(Ax \u2022 Cx) \u2022 (\u2203y)(Py \u2022 Nyx)]\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n- \"Some animals are neglected by cruel people\" can be translated into the statement that there exists at least one animal (Ax) that is neglected by at least one cruel person (Cx).\n- The statement also asserts that there exists at least one person (Py) who is cruel (Cx).\n- Therefore, the translation captures both the existence of neglected animals and the existence of cruel people.\n\nLet's break down the options:\n\nA. (\u2203x)[(Ax \u2022 Cx) \u2022 (\u2203y)(Py \u2022 Nyx)]\n   - This option correctly captures the statement by asserting the existence of at least one animal (Ax) that is neglected by at least one cruel person (Cx), and the existence of at least one cruel person (Py) who neglects an animal (Nyx).\n\nB. (\u2203x)[(Cx \u2022 Px) \u2022 (\u2203y)(Ay \u2022 Nxy)]\n   - This option is incorrect because it does not correctly capture the relationship between animals and cruel people. It suggests that there exists at least one cruel person (Cx) who is a person (Px), and at least one animal (Ay) that is neglected by an animal (Nxy). This does not align with the original statement.\n\nC. (\u2203x)[(Ax \u2022 Px) \u2022 (\u2203y)(Cy \u2022 Nxy)]\n   - This option is incorrect because it does not correctly capture the relationship between animals and cruel people. It suggests that there exists at least one animal (Ax) that is a person (Px), and at least one cruel person (Cy) who neglects an animal (Nxy). This does not align with the original statement.\n\nD. (\u2203x)(\u2203y){[(Ax \u2022 Cy) \u2022 Py] \u2022 Nxy)]}\n   - This option is incorrect because it does not correctly capture the relationship between animals and cruel people. It suggests that there exists at least one animal (Ax) that is a person (Py) who is cruel (Cy), and at least one animal (Nxy) that is neglected by an animal (Cy). This does not align with the original statement.\n\nTherefore, the best translation into predicate logic is option A.",
