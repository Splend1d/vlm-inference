This option is unlikely.\n\nB. The \"frost line\" is the distance from a star where temperatures are low enough for volatile compounds like water, ammonia, and methane to condense into solid ice. Gas giants beyond this line are more likely to form from the accumulation of these volatiles. This option is plausible.\n\nC. If hot Jupiters formed as dense rocky planets close to the star, they would likely be too hot to exist in their current orbits. This option is unlikely.\n\nD. If hot Jupiters formed as gas giants close to the star, they would not maintain their current orbits. This option is unlikely.\n\nConsidering these points, the most likely explanation is that hot Jupiters form as gas giants beyond the frost line and then migrate inwards. This process allows them to reach their current orbits while maintaining the necessary conditions for their formation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. They formed as gas giants beyond the frost line and then migrated inwards.",
