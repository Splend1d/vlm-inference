            "content": "Let's analyze each statement to determine which one is true.\n\nA. All revenue bills must originate in the Senate before moving to the House.\n- This statement is false. In the United States, revenue bills must originate in the House of Representatives, not the Senate. This is a constitutional requirement to ensure that the House, which is directly elected by the people, has the power to generate revenue.\n\nB. Representation in the House is allocated equally among the states, while representation in the Senate is allocated proportional to population.\n- This statement is true. The House of Representatives is apportioned based on the population of each state, with each state having at least one representative. The Senate, on the other hand, is divided equally among the states, with two senators representing each state regardless of population.\n\nC. The Speaker of the House wields less power than the president pro tempore of the Senate.\n- This statement is false. The Speaker of the House is the presiding officer of the House and is the most powerful figure in the House. The president pro tempore of the Senate is the presiding officer of the Senate and is second in line to the vice president, but the Speaker of the House holds more direct influence over legislative proceedings.\n\nD. The House has a Committee on Ways and Means, while the Senate does not.\n- This statement is false. Both the House and the Senate have committees that deal with financial matters. The House has the Committee on Ways and Means, which is responsible for revenue-raising and spending bills. The Senate has the Committee on Finance, which also deals with financial matters.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Representation in the House is allocated equally among the states, while representation in the Senate is allocated proportional to population.",
