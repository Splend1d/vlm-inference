            "content": "To determine the most probable values for the ionization energy and atomic radius of sodium, we need to consider the periodic trends and the given data for magnesium.\n\n1. **Atomic Radius**: \n   - Magnesium has an atomic radius of 160 pm. Sodium, being in the same group (Group 1) as magnesium, will have a similar atomic radius. Therefore, the atomic radius of sodium is likely to be around 160 pm.\n\n2. **Ionization Energy**:\n   - The ionization energy of magnesium is 737 kJ/mol. Ionization energy generally increases across a period and decreases down a group in the periodic table.\n   - Sodium is one period below magnesium, so its ionization energy will be lower than magnesium's.\n   - Considering the trend, the ionization energy of sodium is likely to be around 523 kJ/mol.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n- **Option A**: 186 pm, 496 kJ/mol\n  - The atomic radius is too small compared to the expected value.\n  - The ionization energy is too low compared to the expected value.\n\n- **Option B**: 186 pm, 898 kJ/mol\n  - The atomic radius is too small compared to the expected value.\n  - The ionization energy is too high compared to the expected value.\n\n- **Option C**: 135 pm, 523 kJ/mol\n  - The atomic radius is too small compared to the expected value.\n  - The ionization energy is correct.\n\n- **Option D**: 147 pm, 523 kJ/mol\n  - The atomic radius is close to the expected value.\n  - The ionization energy is correct.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most probable values for the ionization energy and atomic radius of sodium are 523 kJ/mol and 147 pm, respectively.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **D. 147 pm, 523 kJ/mol**.",
