            "content": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Doppler effect**: This refers to the change in frequency or wavelength of a wave in relation to an observer moving relative to the source of the wave. While the Doppler effect is important in astronomy for measuring the velocity of stars and galaxies, it is not directly used to identify elements in a star's outer layers.\n\nB. **Molecular structure**: This involves the arrangement of atoms in molecules. While molecular structure can provide information about the composition of a star, it is not the primary method used by astrophysicists to identify elements in the outer layers of a star.\n\nC. **Temperature**: The temperature of a star can give some clues about its composition, as different elements emit light at different temperatures. However, temperature alone is not sufficient to identify specific elements in the outer layers of a star.\n\nD. **Spectrum**: The spectrum of a star is the distribution of light emitted by the star, which can be analyzed to determine the elements present. Each element has a unique spectral line, which is a specific wavelength of light that the element emits or absorbs. By studying the spectrum, astrophysicists can identify the elements in the outer layers of a star.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nD. spectrum.",
