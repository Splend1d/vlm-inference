            "content": "A recent theory concerning an unusual rise in asthma attacks following a thunderstorm proposes that while pollen grains at 5 microns are too large to enter the airways, their exposure to water precipitates the release of starch granules as a result of osmotic shock. The starch granules are small enough to enter the lower airways and trigger an asthmatic attack. If this theory is true, which of the following is a correct statement?\n\nA. The interior of the pollen grains was hypotonic compared to the surrounding environment.\nB. The interior of the pollen grains had a higher osmotic pressure than did the surrounding environment.\nC. The pollen grains underwent plasmolysis prior to releasing their contents.\nD. The pollen grains underwent shrinking before they ruptured and released their contents.\n",

            "content": "To determine the correct statement, let's analyze the process described in the theory:\n\n1. **Understanding Osmotic Shock**: Osmotic shock occurs when there is a sudden change in osmotic pressure, leading to the movement of water into or out of a cell. In this case, the pollen grains are exposed to water, which causes the starch granules inside to be released.\n\n2. **Hypotonic vs. Hypertonic**: \n   - A hypotonic solution has a lower osmotic pressure than the cell's interior, causing water to move into the cell.\n   - A hypertonic solution has a higher osmotic pressure, causing water to move out of the cell.\n\n3. **Plasmolysis**: This is the process where the cell membrane pulls away from the cell wall due to water loss, typically in a hypertonic solution.\n\n4. **Shrinking and Rupture**: Shrinking occurs when water is lost from the cell, and rupture happens when the cell membrane cannot withstand the pressure, leading to the release of contents.\n\nGiven these points, let's evaluate each option:\n\n- **Option A**: The interior of the pollen grains was hypotonic compared to the surrounding environment.\n  - This is incorrect because the theory states that the interior of the pollen grains had a higher osmotic pressure than the surrounding environment, causing water to enter the grains.\n\n- **Option B**: The interior of the pollen grains had a higher osmotic pressure than did the surrounding environment.\n  - This is correct. The higher osmotic pressure inside the pollen grains causes water to enter, leading to the release of starch granules.\n\n- **Option C**: The pollen grains underwent plasmolysis prior to releasing their contents.\n  - This is incorrect. Plasmolysis is associated with water loss, not the release of contents.\n\n- **Option D**: The pollen grains underwent shrinking before they ruptured and released their contents.\n  - This is incorrect. Shrinking is a result of water loss, not the cause of the release of contents.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is **Option B**: The interior of the pollen grains had a higher osmotic pressure than did the surrounding environment.",
