            "content": "To determine the correct relationship between the federal and state judiciaries, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Federal courts are higher courts than state courts and may overturn state decisions on any grounds.\n- This statement is incorrect. While federal courts are generally higher in the hierarchy, they do not have the power to overturn state decisions on any grounds. Federal courts can only review state court decisions if they raise constitutional issues.\n\nB. The two are entirely autonomous, and neither ever hears cases that originate in the other.\n- This statement is incorrect. Federal and state courts do interact, especially when cases involve federal constitutional issues. Federal courts can review state court decisions under the doctrine of federal question jurisdiction.\n\nC. The two are generally autonomous, although federal courts may rule on the constitutionality of state court decisions.\n- This statement is correct. Federal and state courts operate independently, but federal courts have the authority to review state court decisions to ensure they comply with the U.S. Constitution. This is known as federal question jurisdiction.\n\nD. State courts are trial courts; federal courts are appeals courts.\n- This statement is incorrect. While it is true that state courts are trial courts, federal courts are both trial and appellate courts. Federal courts can hear cases at the trial level and also review decisions made by state courts.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. The two are generally autonomous, although federal courts may rule on the constitutionality of state court decisions.",
