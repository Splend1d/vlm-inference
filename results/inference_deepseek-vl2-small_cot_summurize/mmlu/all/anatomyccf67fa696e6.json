It is not typically involved in blunt trauma to the left upper abdomen.\n\n- **Gallbladder (B):** The gallbladder is situated in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen, near the liver. It is not usually affected by blunt trauma to the left upper abdomen.\n\n- **Spleen (C):** The spleen is located in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen, near the stomach. It is a common site for injury in blunt trauma to the left upper abdomen due to its proximity to the ribs and the diaphragm.\n\n- **Urinary bladder (D):** The urinary bladder is located in the pelvis and is not typically involved in blunt trauma to the upper abdomen.\n\nGiven the anatomical location and the common sites of injury in blunt trauma, the spleen is the organ most likely to be involved in this scenario.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Spleen.",
