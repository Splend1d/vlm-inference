For \\(x = 0\\):\n\\[0^3 + 2(0) + 2 = 2\\]\nThis is not equal to 0, so \\(x = 0\\) is not a zero.\n\n2. For \\(x = 1\\):\n\\[1^3 + 2(1) + 2 = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5\\]\nThis is not equal to 0, so \\(x = 1\\) is not a zero.\n\n3. For \\(x = 2\\):\n\\[2^3 + 2(2) + 2 = 8 + 4 + 2 = 14\\]\nThis is not equal to 0, so \\(x = 2\\) is not a zero.\n\n4. For \\(x = 3\\):\n\\[3^3 + 2(3) + 2 = 27 + 6 + 2 = 35\\]\nThis is not equal to 0, so \\(x = 3\\) is not a zero.\n\n5.

For \\(x = 5\\):\n\\[5^3 + 2(5) + 2 = 125 + 10 + 2 = 137\\]\nThis is not equal to 0, so \\(x = 5\\) is not a zero.\n\n7.

For \\(x = 0\\):\n\\[0^3 + 2(0) - 12 = -12\\]\nThis is not equal to 0, so \\(x = 0\\) is not a zero.\n\n2. For \\(x = 1\\):\n\\[1^3 + 2(1) - 12 = 1 + 2 - 12 = -9\\]\nThis is not equal to 0, so \\(x = 1\\) is not a zero.\n\n3. For \\(x = 2\\):\n\\[2^3 + 2(2) - 12 = 8 + 4 - 12 = 0\\]\nThis is equal to 0, so \\(x = 2\\) is a zero.\n\n4.
