Find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 4 and 32. The GCD of 4 and 32 is 4.\n2. Divide both numbers by their GCD:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{4}{4} = 1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{32}{4} = 8\n   \\]\n3. The simplified ratio is 1 : 8.\n\nNow, compare the simplified ratio 1 : 8 with the given options:\n\nA. 2 : 96; 2 : 16\nB. 12 : 96; 2 : 16\nC. 12 : 96; 12 : 16\nD. 2 : 96; 12 : 16\n\nWe need to check if any of these ratios can be simplified to 1 : 8.\n\n- For option A:\n  - 2 : 96 can be simplified to 1 : 48.\n  - 2 : 16 can be simplified to 1 : 8.\n  - Since 1 : 8 is not in option A, option A is incorrect.\n\n- For option B:\n  - 12 : 96 can be simplified to 1 : 8.\n  - 2 : 16 can be simplified to 1 : 8.\n  - Both ratios are 1 : 8, so option B is correct.\n\n- For option C:\n  - 12 : 96 can be simplified to 1 : 8.\n  - 12 : 16 can be simplified to 3 : 4.\n  - Since 3 : 4 is not 1 : 8, option C is incorrect.\n\n- For option D:\n  - 2 : 96 can be simplified to 1 : 48.\n  - 12 : 16 can be simplified to 3 : 4.\n  - Since 1 : 48 is not 1 : 8, option D is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option B: 12 : 96; 2 : 16.",
