            "content": "To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of points the basketball player scored in his second game, denoted as \\( p \\).\n\nWe are given the following information:\n- The player scored 18 points in his first game.\n- This is 4 points fewer than he scored in his second game.\n\nWe can set up the equation based on this information. Let \\( p \\) be the number of points scored in the second game. According to the problem, the number of points scored in the first game is 4 points fewer than the number of points scored in the second game. Therefore, we can write the equation as:\n\n\\[ 18 = p - 4 \\]\n\nThis equation states that the points scored in the first game (18) is equal to the points scored in the second game minus 4.\n\nNow, let's verify the options provided:\n\nA. \\( 18 = p - 4; 14 \\)\n- This option suggests that the points scored in the first game is 14, which is not correct.\n\nB. \\( 18 = p - 4; 22 \\)\n- This option suggests that the points scored in the first game is 22, which is not correct.\n\nC. \\( 18 - 4 = p; 14 \\)\n- This option suggests that the points scored in the first game is 14, which is not correct.\n\nD. \\( 18 - p = 4; 22 \\)\n- This option suggests that the points scored in the first game is 4, which is not correct.\n\nThe correct equation based on the problem statement is:\n\n\\[ 18 = p - 4 \\]\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]",
