            "content": "To determine which compound should be named using Roman numerals after the cation, we need to understand the naming conventions for ionic compounds.\n\n1. **Identify the Cation**: The cation is the positively charged ion that forms the compound. In the given options:\n   - CaCl2: The cation is Ca\u00b2\u207a.\n   - CuCl2: The cation is Cu\u00b2\u207a.\n   - AlBr3: The cation is Al\u00b3\u207a.\n   - K2Cr2O7: The cation is K\u207a.\n\n2. **Identify the Anion**: The anion is the negatively charged ion that forms the compound. In the given options:\n   - CaCl2: The anion is Cl\u207b.\n   - CuCl2: The anion is Cl\u207b.\n   - AlBr3: The anion is Br\u207b.\n   - K2Cr2O7: The anion is Cr\u2082O\u2087\u00b2\u207b.\n\n3. **Apply Roman Numerals**: Roman numerals are used to indicate the charge of the cation in the compound. The charge of the cation is the number of electrons lost or gained.\n\n   - For CaCl2, the cation is Ca\u00b2\u207a, so it is named as \"II\" (II for two).\n   - For CuCl2, the cation is Cu\u00b2\u207a, so it is named as \"II\" (II for two).\n   - For AlBr3, the cation is Al\u00b3\u207a, so it is named as \"III\" (III for three).\n   - For K2Cr2O7, the cation is K\u207a, so it is named as \"I\" (I for one).\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Based on the above analysis, the compound that should be named using Roman numerals after the cation is AlBr3, as the cation Al\u00b3\u207a is named as \"III\".\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **C. AlBr3**.",
