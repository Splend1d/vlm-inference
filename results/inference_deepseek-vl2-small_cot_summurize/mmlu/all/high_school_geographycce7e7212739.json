Sunni: Sunni Islam is the largest branch of Islam, comprising about 85-90% of Muslims worldwide. Sunnis believe in the first four caliphs (Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthman, and Ali) and do not recognize the concept of the Imams as infallible or divinely appointed.\n\nB. Shiite: Shiite Islam, on the other hand, is the second-largest branch, comprising about 10-15% of Muslims. Shiites believe in the Imams, who are considered infallible and divinely appointed successors to the Prophet Muhammad. They also believe in the concept of the Twelver Imams, who are believed to be the direct descendants of Ali, the cousin and son-in-law of the Prophet Muhammad.\n\nC. Imam: The term \"Imam\" refers to a leader or authority figure in Islam, but it is not a specific sect. It can be used to describe any respected religious leader.\n\nD. Untouchables: This term is not related to Islamic sects and is a social classification in India, not a religious group.\n\nGiven this analysis, the group that represents the Persian (Iranian) variation of Islam and believes in the infallibility and divine right to authority of the Imams descended from Ali is:\n\nB.
