It contains salivary glands that secrete saliva, which contains enzymes such as amylase. Amylase begins the process of breaking down carbohydrates into simpler sugars.\n\nB. **Stomach**: The stomach is a muscular organ that secretes gastric juices. These juices contain hydrochloric acid and pepsin, an enzyme that breaks down proteins into smaller peptides.\n\nC. **Gall Bladder**: The gall bladder stores bile, a digestive fluid produced by the liver. Bile contains bile salts and enzymes like lipase, which help in the digestion and absorption of fats.\n\nD. **Small Intestine**: The small intestine is the primary site for nutrient absorption. It does not secrete digestive enzymes; instead, it contains enzymes produced by the pancreas and the brush border of the intestinal lining.\n\nBy examining each option, we can conclude that the small intestine does not secrete digestive enzymes. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Small intestine",
