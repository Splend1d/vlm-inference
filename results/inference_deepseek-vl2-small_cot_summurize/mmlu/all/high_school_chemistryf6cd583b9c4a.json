While all bases can donate OH- ions, not all bases are strong bases. Weak bases do not fully dissociate in solution, so they do not donate OH- ions as readily as strong bases.\n\nB. Only strong bases create solutions in which OH- ions are present.\n- This statement is correct. Strong bases, such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and potassium hydroxide (KOH), dissociate completely in water, meaning they donate all their OH- ions to the solution. This results in a high concentration of OH- ions, making the solution basic.\n\nC. Only strong bases are good conductors when dissolved in solution.\n- This statement is incorrect. While strong bases are good conductors because they dissociate completely and provide a high concentration of ions, weak bases can also conduct electricity to some extent, though not as effectively as strong bases.\n\nD. For weak bases, the concentration of the OH-ions exceeds the concentration of the base in the solution.\n- This statement is incorrect. For weak bases, the concentration of the base is greater than the concentration of the OH- ions because they do not dissociate completely.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the correct answer is B. Only strong bases create solutions in which OH- ions are present.",
