            "content": "To determine which statement is true, we need to understand the nature of protons and neutrons and their angular momentum.\n\n1. **Protons and Neutrons**: Protons and neutrons are subatomic particles that make up the nucleus of an atom. They are both fermions, which means they follow the Pauli exclusion principle. This principle states that no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.\n\n2. **Angular Momentum**: Angular momentum is a measure of an object's tendency to keep rotating or revolving around a central point. It is a vector quantity, meaning it has both magnitude and direction.\n\n3. **Spin Angular Momentum**: Protons and neutrons have an intrinsic form of angular momentum known as spin angular momentum. This is a fundamental property of fermions and is responsible for their behavior in magnetic fields. The spin of a proton or neutron is 1/2, which means it can have two possible orientations: \"up\" or \"down.\"\n\n4. **Orbital Angular Momentum**: Orbital angular momentum is associated with the motion of particles around a nucleus or around a central point in space. It is not intrinsic to protons and neutrons but is related to the motion of electrons in an atom. Electrons have orbital angular momentum due to their motion around the nucleus.\n\n5. **Analysis of Options**:\n   - **Option A**: Incorrect. Protons and neutrons do not have orbital angular momentum.\n   - **Option B**: Correct. Protons have both spin and orbital angular momentum, while neutrons have only spin angular momentum.\n   - **Option C**: Incorrect. Protons and neutrons do not possess orbital angular momentum only.\n   - **Option D**: Incorrect. Protons and neutrons do not possess spin angular momentum only.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. Protons have orbital and spin angular momentum, neutrons have spin angular momentum.**",
