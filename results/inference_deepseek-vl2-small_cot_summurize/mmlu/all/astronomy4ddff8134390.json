            "content": "To understand why Uranus and Neptune have blue methane clouds while Jupiter and Saturn do not, we need to consider the atmospheric conditions and the composition of these planets.\n\nA. Methane does not condense into ice in the warmer atmospheric temperatures of Jupiter and Saturn.\n- This option is incorrect. While it is true that Jupiter and Saturn have warmer temperatures, the primary reason for the absence of methane clouds is not due to the inability of methane to condense into ice. Methane can indeed condense into clouds under certain conditions, but the presence of methane clouds is not solely dependent on temperature.\n\nB. Methane did not exist in the solar nebula at the radii of Jupiter and Saturn when the planets formed.\n- This option is incorrect. The presence of methane in the solar nebula is not a determining factor for the presence of methane clouds on the planets. The formation of methane clouds is more related to atmospheric conditions and chemical processes.\n\nC. The relatively slow rotation of Uranus and Neptune allows methane to migrate to higher levels in the atmosphere and condense into clouds.\n- This option is correct. Uranus and Neptune have slower rotation rates compared to Jupiter and Saturn. This slower rotation allows methane to be transported to higher altitudes in the atmosphere, where it can condense into clouds. The slower rotation also means that methane can remain in the atmosphere for longer periods, increasing the likelihood of cloud formation.\n\nD. Methane reacts with the abundant ammonia clouds in Jupiter and Saturn and is removed from the atmosphere.\n- This option is incorrect. While ammonia clouds are present on Jupiter and Saturn, the presence of methane clouds is not due to the reaction with ammonia. The absence of methane clouds is more related to the atmospheric conditions and the planet's rotation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. The relatively slow rotation of Uranus and Neptune allows methane to migrate to higher levels in the atmosphere and condense into clouds.",
