This is a critical period where the palatine processes begin to come together.\n   - **Ten Weeks Post-Fertilization**: The fusion continues, but the palatine processes are not yet fully fused.\n   - **Twelve Weeks Post-Fertilization**: At this stage, the palatine processes are almost completely fused, forming the primary palate.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Based on the developmental timeline, the palatine processes begin to fuse at eight weeks post-fertilization.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. eight weeks post-fertilization**.",
