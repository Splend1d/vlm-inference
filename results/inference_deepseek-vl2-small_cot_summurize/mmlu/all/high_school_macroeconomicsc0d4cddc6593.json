            "content": "Contractionary monetary policy is a tool used by central banks to reduce inflation and slow down an overheating economy. This policy involves increasing the discount rate, which is the interest rate at which commercial banks borrow money from the central bank.\n\n1. **Discount Rate**: When the central bank increases the discount rate, it becomes more expensive for commercial banks to borrow money from the central bank. This increase in borrowing costs can lead to a decrease in the money supply in the economy, as banks may be less inclined to lend money to businesses and consumers.\n\n2. **Nominal Interest Rate**: The nominal interest rate is the rate of interest charged on loans and savings accounts, not directly affected by the discount rate. However, the increase in the discount rate can lead to an increase in the nominal interest rate as banks pass on the higher borrowing costs to their customers.\n\n3. **Aggregate Demand**: Aggregate demand is the total demand for goods and services in an economy at a given overall price level and in a given time period. When the discount rate increases, the cost of borrowing for businesses and consumers increases, which can lead to a decrease in aggregate demand. This is because higher borrowing costs can reduce consumer spending and business investment, which are key components of aggregate demand.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC.
