Therefore, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Position of point B} = \\text{Position of point A} - 5 = -20 - 5 = -25\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the direction of point B relative to point A**: Since point B is located at -25 and point A is at -20, point B is to the left of point A on the numberline.\n\n4. **Combine the information**: Point B is located at -25 and is to the left of point A on the numberline.\n\nThus, the correct statement about point B is:\n\nC. It is located at -25 and is to the left of point A on the numberline.",
