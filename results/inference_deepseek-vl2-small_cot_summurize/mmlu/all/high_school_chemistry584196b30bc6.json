The temperature of the mixture rose to reach a final temperature of 35 \u00b0C. Which of the following can be concluded?\n\nA. The sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did; therefore the sample lost more heat energy than the water gained.\nB. The sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did, but the sample lost the same amount of heat energy as the water gained.\nC. The sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did; therefore the CP of the sample must be greater than the CP of the water.\nD. The final temperature is less than the average starting temperature of the sample and the water; therefore the total energy of the sample and water decreased.\n",

            "content": "To determine the correct conclusion, we need to analyze the heat transfer process using the principle of conservation of energy.\n\n1. **Initial Conditions**:\n   - The sample has a mass of 25 g and is initially at 100 \u00b0C.\n   - The water has a mass of 100 g and is initially at 22 \u00b0C.\n\n2. **Final Temperature**:\n   - The final temperature of the mixture is 35 \u00b0C.\n\n3. **Heat Transfer**:\n   - The heat lost by the sample is equal to the heat gained by the water. This is because the system is insulated, meaning no heat is lost to the surroundings.\n\n4. **Calculating Heat Transfer**:\n   - The heat lost by the sample can be calculated using the formula:\n     \\[\n     q_{\\text{sample}} = m_{\\text{sample}} \\cdot c_{\\text{sample}} \\cdot \\Delta T_{\\text{sample}}\n     \\]\n     where \\( m_{\\text{sample}} = 25 \\, \\text{g} \\), \\( c_{\\text{sample}} = 4.18 \\, \\text{J/g\u00b0C} \\) (specific heat capacity of water), and \\( \\Delta T_{\\text{sample}} = 100 - 35 = 65 \\, \\text{\u00b0C} \\).\n\n     \\[\n     q_{\\text{sample}} = 25 \\cdot 4.18 \\cdot 65 = 6875 \\, \\text{J}\n     \\]\n\n   - The heat gained by the water can be calculated using the formula:\n     \\[\n     q_{\\text{water}} = m_{\\text{water}} \\cdot c_{\\text{water}} \\cdot \\Delta T_{\\text{water}}\n     \\]\n     where \\( m_{\\text{water}} = 100 \\, \\text{g} \\), \\( c_{\\text{water}} = 4.18 \\, \\text{J/g\u00b0C} \\), and \\( \\Delta T_{\\text{water}} = 35 - 22 = 13 \\, \\text{\u00b0C} \\).\n\n     \\[\n     q_{\\text{water}} = 100 \\cdot 4.18 \\cdot 13 = 5414 \\, \\text{J}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the heat lost by the sample is equal to the heat gained by the water, the sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did.\n   - The heat lost by the sample is equal to the heat gained by the water, indicating that the specific heat capacity (CP) of the sample is not greater than that of the water.\n\nTherefore, the correct conclusion is:\n\nB. The sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did, but the sample lost the same amount of heat energy as the water gained.",
