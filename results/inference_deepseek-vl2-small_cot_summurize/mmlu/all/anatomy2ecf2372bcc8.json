            "content": "To determine which bone has a process that joins with the zygomatic bone to form the zygomatic arch, we need to understand the anatomy of the zygomatic arch and the role of the zygomatic bone.\n\nThe zygomatic arch is a bony arch formed by the zygomatic bone, which is the cheekbone, and the temporal bone. The zygomatic bone is a flat, triangular bone that forms the prominence of the cheek and the lateral wall of the orbit.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. The maxillary bone: The maxillary bone is located below the zygomatic bone and forms the upper jaw and the floor of the orbit. It does not contribute to the formation of the zygomatic arch.\n\nB. The temporal bone: The temporal bone is located on the side of the skull and forms part of the orbit and the base of the skull. It does not have a process that joins with the zygomatic bone to form the zygomatic arch.\n\nC. The sphenoid bone: The sphenoid bone is a complex bone located at the base of the skull. It has several processes, including the greater wing of the sphenoid, which extends forward and upward to join with the zygomatic bone, forming the zygomatic arch.\n\nD. The frontal bone: The frontal bone is located at the front of the skull and forms the forehead. It does not have a process that joins with the zygomatic bone to form the zygomatic arch.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is C. The sphenoid bone, as it has a process that joins with the zygomatic bone to form the zygomatic arch.",
