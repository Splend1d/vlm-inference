            "content": "To determine which of the given options is NOT a group, we need to recall the definition of a group in abstract algebra. A set \\( G \\) with a binary operation \\( \\cdot \\) is a group if it satisfies the following four properties:\n\n1. **Closure**: For all \\( a, b \\in G \\), the result of the operation \\( a \\cdot b \\) is also in \\( G \\).\n2. **Associativity**: For all \\( a, b, c \\in G \\), the equation \\( (a \\cdot b) \\cdot c = a \\cdot (b \\cdot c) \\) holds.\n3. **Identity element**: There exists an element \\( e \\in G \\) such that for all \\( a \\in G \\), \\( e \\cdot a = a \\cdot e = a \\).\n4. **Inverse element**: For each \\( a \\in G \\), there exists an element \\( b \\in G \\) such that \\( a \\cdot b = b \\cdot a = e \\).\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **The integers under addition**:\n   - The integers under addition form a group. This is because:\n     - **Closure**: The sum of any two integers is an integer.\n     - **Associativity**: The order of addition does not affect the result.\n     - **Identity element**: The integer 0 is the identity element because \\( a + 0 = a \\) for any integer \\( a \\).\n     - **Inverse element**: For any integer \\( a \\), the inverse is \\( -a \\) because \\( a + (-a) = 0 \\).\n\nB. **The nonzero integers under multiplication**:\n   - The nonzero integers under multiplication form a group. This is because:\n     - **Closure**: The product of any two nonzero integers is a nonzero integer.\n     - **Associativity**: The order of multiplication does not affect the result.\n     - **Identity element**: The integer 1 is the identity element because \\( a \\cdot 1 = a \\) for any nonzero integer \\( a \\).\n     - **Inverse element**: For any nonzero integer \\( a \\), the inverse is \\( \\frac{1}{a} \\) because \\( a \\cdot \\frac{1}{a} = 1 \\).\n\nC. **The nonzero real numbers under multiplication**:\n   - The nonzero real numbers under multiplication form a group. This is because:\n     - **Closure**: The product of any two nonzero real numbers is a nonzero real number.\n     - **Associativity**: The order of multiplication does not affect the result.\n     - **Identity element**: The real number 1 is the identity element because \\( a \\cdot 1 = a \\) for any nonzero real number \\( a \\).\n     - **Inverse element**: For any nonzero real number \\( a \\), the inverse is \\( \\frac{1}{a} \\) because \\( a \\cdot \\frac{1}{a} = 1 \\).\n\nD. **The complex numbers under addition**:\n   - The complex numbers under addition do not form a group. This is because:\n     - **Closure**: The sum of two complex numbers is not necessarily a complex number. For example, \\( i + 1 \\) is not a complex number.\n     - **Associativity**: The order of addition does not affect the result.\n     - **Identity element**: There is no identity element for complex numbers under addition because there is no element that, when added to any complex number, results in the complex number itself.\n     - **Inverse element**: There is no inverse element for complex numbers under addition because there is no element that, when added to any complex number, results in the complex number itself.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD.
