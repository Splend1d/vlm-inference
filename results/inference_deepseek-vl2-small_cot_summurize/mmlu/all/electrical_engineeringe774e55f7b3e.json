            "content": "To determine the one-cycle surge current rating of an SCR (Silicon Controlled Rectifier), we need to understand the concept of surge current and how it is calculated.\n\nThe surge current rating of an SCR is typically given for half-cycle conditions, meaning the current is measured over half of the AC cycle. For a 50 Hz supply, the period of the AC cycle is 20 milliseconds (1/50 Hz).\n\nGiven:\n- Half-cycle surge current rating = 3000 A\n\nTo find the one-cycle surge current rating, we need to double the half-cycle surge current rating because the surge current is measured over the full cycle.\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\text{One-cycle surge current rating} = 2 \\times \\text{Half-cycle surge current rating} \\]\n\\[ \\text{One-cycle surge current rating} = 2 \\times 3000 \\, \\text{A} \\]\n\\[ \\text{One-cycle surge current rating} = 6000 \\, \\text{A} \\]\n\nTherefore, the one-cycle surge current rating of the SCR is 6000 A.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nB. 6000 A.",
