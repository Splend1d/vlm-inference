            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the properties of a depth-first search (DFS) tree and the given conditions.\n\n1. **Understanding DFS Tree Properties:**\n   - In a DFS tree, the depth of a node is the number of edges from the root to that node.\n   - The preorder traversal of a DFS tree visits nodes in the order: root, left subtree, right subtree.\n   - The postorder traversal of a DFS tree visits nodes in the order: left subtree, right subtree, root.\n\n2. **Given Conditions:**\n   - \\( \\text{pre}(u) < \\text{pre}(v) \\)\n   - \\( (u, v) \\) is an edge in \\( G \\) that is not in \\( T \\).\n\n3. **Analyzing the Conditions:**\n   - Since \\( \\text{pre}(u) < \\text{pre}(v) \\), it means that \\( u \\) is visited before \\( v \\) in the DFS tree.\n   - This implies that \\( u \\) is not the root of the DFS tree, as the root would be visited before any other node.\n\n4. **Evaluating the Statements:**\n   - **Statement I: \\( \\text{post}(u) < \\text{post}(v) \\)**\n     - This statement is not necessarily true. The postorder traversal of a DFS tree visits nodes in the order: left subtree, right subtree, root. Since \\( u \\) is visited before \\( v \\), \\( \\text{post}(u) \\) could be equal to or greater than \\( \\text{post}(v) \\).\n\n   - **Statement II: \\( u \\) is an ancestor of \\( v \\) in \\( T \\)**\n     - This statement is not necessarily true. \\( u \\) could be an ancestor of \\( v \\) in \\( T \\) if \\( u \\) is a child of \\( v \\) in the DFS tree. However, since \\( u \\) is not the root, it is not guaranteed to be an ancestor of \\( v \\).\n\n   - **Statement III: If \\( w \\) is the lowest common ancestor of \\( u \\) and \\( v \\) in \\( T \\), then \\( w = u \\)**\n     - This statement is not necessarily true. The lowest common ancestor of \\( u \\) and \\( v \\) in \\( T \\) is a vertex \\( w \\) such that \\( w \\) is an ancestor of both \\( u \\) and \\( v \\), and no child of \\( w \\) is an ancestor of both \\( u \\) and \\( v \\). It is possible that \\( w \\) is not \\( u \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Based on the analysis, none of the statements I, II, or III must be true.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the correct answer based on the given options. Given the options, the closest statement that could be considered true based on the conditions is:\n\n- **Statement I: \\( \\text{post}(u) < \\text{post}(v) \\)**\n\nThis is because, in a DFS tree, the postorder traversal visits nodes in the order: left subtree, right subtree, root. Since \\( u \\) is visited before \\( v \\), \\( \\text{post}(u) \\) could be less than \\( \\text{post}(v) \\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. I only",
