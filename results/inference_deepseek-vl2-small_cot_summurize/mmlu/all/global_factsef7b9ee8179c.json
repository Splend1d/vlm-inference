It is a measure of the average economic output per person.\n\n2. **Identify the GDP values for 1950 and 2016**:\n   - For 1950, the GDP per capita in Japan was approximately $1,000.\n   - For 2016, the GDP per capita in Japan was approximately $20,000.\n\n3. **Calculate the increase**:\n   - The increase in GDP per capita is calculated by subtracting the 1950 value from the 2016 value:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Increase} = 20,000 - 1,000 = 19,000\n     \\]\n\n4. **Determine the fold increase**:\n   - To find the fold increase, divide the increase by the 1950 value:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Fold Increase} = \\frac{19,000}{1,000} = 19\n     \\]\n\n5. **Interpret the fold increase**:\n   - A fold increase of 19 means that the GDP per capita has increased by a factor of 19 from 1950 to 2016.\n\nGiven the options:\nA. by 5 fold\nB. by 10 fold\nC. by 15 fold\nD. by 20 fold\n\nThe correct answer is **D. by 20 fold**.",
