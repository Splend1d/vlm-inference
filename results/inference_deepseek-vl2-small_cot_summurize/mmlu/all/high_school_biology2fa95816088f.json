            "content": "To determine which statement is true, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. It is created by the direct action of natural selection.\n- This statement is incorrect. Genetic variation is not created by natural selection. Instead, natural selection acts on existing genetic variation to favor traits that enhance survival and reproduction.\n\nB. It arises in response to changes in the environment.\n- This statement is also incorrect. Genetic variation is not directly caused by environmental changes. Instead, it is a result of mutations and genetic recombination that occur over time, independent of environmental pressures.\n\nC. It must be present in a population before natural selection can act upon the population.\n- This statement is correct. Genetic variation is necessary for natural selection to act upon a population. Without variation, there would be no differences in traits to be selected for, and thus, no evolutionary change.\n\nD. It tends to be reduced by the processes involved when diploid organisms produce gametes.\n- This statement is incorrect. The processes involved in gamete production, such as meiosis, actually increase genetic variation. Meiosis introduces new combinations of alleles, which is a key source of genetic diversity.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Genetic variation must be present in a population before natural selection can act upon the population.",
