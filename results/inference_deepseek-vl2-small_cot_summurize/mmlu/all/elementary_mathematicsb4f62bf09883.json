This property states that a(b + c) = ab + ac.\n\nFirst, we can rewrite the expression as 2,816 x (7 + 0).\n\nNow, we can use the distributive property to expand the expression:\n\n2,816 x 7 + 2,816 x 0\n\nNext, we can calculate the value of each term:\n\n2,816 x 7 = 19,712\n2,816 x 0 = 0\n\nFinally, we can add the two values together:\n\n19,712 + 0 = 19,712\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression 2,816 x 7 is 19,712.\n\nThe correct answer is D. 19,712.\n\nThe final answer is: \\(19,712\\)",
