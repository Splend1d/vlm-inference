            "content": "To determine which theorist tried to explain the prices of farm products in relation to land use patterns, we need to analyze the contributions of each option:\n\nA. Rostow: W.W. Rostow was an American economist known for his work on economic development and growth. He is not primarily known for theories related to land use and farm product pricing.\n\nB. Ravenstein: Henry E. Ravenstein was an American sociologist and statistician who made significant contributions to the study of population and migration patterns. His work is not focused on agricultural economics or land use.\n\nC. Von Th\u00fcnen: Carl von Th\u00fcnen was a German-born American economist who is best known for his work on agricultural economics and the theory of land use. In his seminal work, \"The Isolated State,\" von Th\u00fcnen proposed a model that explains how different types of land use are influenced by the distance from the market. He suggested that the price of farm products is determined by the cost of transporting the product from the farm to the market, and this cost varies with the distance from the market. This theory is foundational in understanding how land use patterns affect agricultural economics.\n\nD. Burgess: Homer H. Burgess was an American geographer and urban planner known for his work on urban land use patterns. While his work is related to geography, it does not focus on agricultural economics or the pricing of farm products.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is C. Von Th\u00fcnen, as he is the theorist who developed the model explaining the relationship between land use patterns and the prices of farm products.",
