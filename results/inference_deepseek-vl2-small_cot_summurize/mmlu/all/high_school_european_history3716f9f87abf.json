Your Committee object to the words Household Suffrage since under any honest definition of the words\u2014they would exclude a large majority of the men of these kingdoms\u2014and because they have become reasonably obnoxious to the political portion of the working people.\n\u2014Excerpt of a letter from British social reformer Francis Place, written in 1842\nThe primary goal of the Chartist movement was which of the following?\n\nA. Universal suffrage\nB. Universal male suffrage\nC. Universal health care\nD. Social security and unemployment insurance\n",

            "content": "The primary goal of the Chartist movement was universal male suffrage. The movement, which was active in the 1830s and 1840s, aimed to secure the right to vote for all adult men, regardless of their social class or occupation. The movement was named after the Chartist newspaper, which was a key platform for the movement's ideas and demands.\n\nThe excerpt from Francis Place's letter, written in 1842, provides context for the movement's goals. Place criticizes the use of the term \"Household Suffrage,\" which he argues would exclude a large majority of men in the kingdom. He also mentions that the movement has become \"obnoxious to the political portion of the working people,\" suggesting that the movement's goals were not aligned with the interests of all working-class men.\n\nThe other options, such as universal health care, social security, and unemployment insurance, were not the primary goals of the Chartist movement. While these issues were important to the working class, the Chartist movement focused specifically on securing the right to vote for all adult men.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Universal male suffrage.",
