It is not the synthesis of glucose from lactate, glycerol, or amino acids.\n\nB. Glycolysis: This is the process of breaking down glucose into pyruvate, producing ATP and NADH. It is not the synthesis of glucose from lactate, glycerol, or amino acids.\n\nC. Lipolysis: This is the breakdown of fats into fatty acids and glycerol. It is not the synthesis of glucose from lactate, glycerol, or amino acids.\n\nD. Gluconeogenesis: This is the process of synthesizing glucose from non-carbohydrate sources such as lactate, glycerol, and amino acids. It is the correct answer.\n\nTherefore, the synthesis of glucose from lactate, glycerol, or amino acids is called gluconeogenesis.",
