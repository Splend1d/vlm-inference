            "content": "To determine which statement is true, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Grade 3/5 (MRC scale) represents movement of the arm only when gravity is eliminated**\n\n   - The Modified Rankin Scale (MRC) is used to assess motor function in patients with stroke or brain injury. A Grade 3/5 indicates that the patient can move the arm against gravity, but not without assistance. This means gravity is not eliminated, but the arm can still move. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\nB. **Flexion at the elbow is produced by the triceps muscle**\n\n   - The triceps muscle is primarily responsible for extending the elbow, not flexing it. Flexion at the elbow is primarily produced by the biceps brachii muscle. Thus, this statement is incorrect.\n\nC. **The root value of shoulder abduction is C5**\n\n   - The root value of a motor function is the level of the spinal cord or brainstem that is involved in the movement. In the case of shoulder abduction, the root value is C5, which is the level of the cervical spinal cord. This statement is correct.\n\nD. **Grade 1/5 power represents no movement or muscle contraction**\n\n   - A Grade 1/5 on the MRC scale indicates that the patient has no movement or muscle contraction. This is the most severe level of motor impairment. Therefore, this statement is correct.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the correct statements are:\n\n- C. The root value of shoulder abduction is C5\n- D. Grade 1/5 power represents no movement or muscle contraction",
