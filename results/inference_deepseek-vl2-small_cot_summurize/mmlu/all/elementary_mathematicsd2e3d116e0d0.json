            "content": "To determine the distance Lee threw the ball, we need to understand the relationship between the distances thrown by Jean and Lee.\n\n1. **Identify the given information:**\n   - Jean threw a softball a distance of 9 feet.\n   - Lee threw a softball 3 times as far as Jean.\n\n2. **Determine the distance Lee threw:**\n   - Since Lee threw 3 times as far as Jean, we can calculate Lee's distance as:\n     \\[\n     d = 3 \\times 9\n     \\]\n\n3. **Verify the options:**\n   - **Option A: \\( dx3 = 9 \\)**\n     - This equation suggests that the distance is multiplied by 3, which is incorrect. The correct relationship is that Lee's distance is 3 times Jean's distance.\n   - **Option B: \\( d + 3 = 9 \\)**\n     - This equation suggests that the distance is 3 more than 9, which is incorrect. The correct relationship is that Lee's distance is 3 times Jean's distance.\n   - **Option C: \\( 3 + 9 = d \\)**\n     - This equation suggests that the distance is the sum of 3 and 9, which is incorrect. The correct relationship is that Lee's distance is 3 times Jean's distance.\n   - **Option D: \\( 3 \\times 9 = d \\)**\n     - This equation correctly represents the relationship that Lee's distance is 3 times Jean's distance.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The correct equation to determine the distance Lee threw the ball is:\n     \\[\n     d = 3 \\times 9\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{D}\n\\]",
