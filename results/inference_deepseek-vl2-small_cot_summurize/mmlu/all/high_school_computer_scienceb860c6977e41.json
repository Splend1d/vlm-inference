            "content": "To determine the best use of Huffman coding, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Decryption: Decryption involves converting encrypted data back into its original form. Huffman coding is not used in decryption processes. It is a method of encoding data, not decoding it.\n\nB. Efficient sorting: Sorting algorithms are used to arrange data in a specific order. Huffman coding is not related to sorting processes. It is a method of encoding data, not a sorting technique.\n\nC. Lossless compression: Huffman coding is a lossless compression technique. It assigns shorter codes to more frequent data and longer codes to less frequent data, allowing the original data to be perfectly reconstructed from the encoded data. This makes it ideal for lossless compression, where the goal is to reduce the size of data without losing any information.\n\nD. Lossy compression: Lossy compression involves reducing the size of data by discarding some information, which can lead to a loss of quality. Huffman coding is not used for lossy compression, as it does not discard any information.\n\nBased on the analysis, the best use of Huffman coding is for lossless compression. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Lossless compression",
