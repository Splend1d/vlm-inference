            "content": "To determine which statement is true, we need to understand the concept of optical isomerism in coordination chemistry. Optical isomerism occurs when a molecule has two or more stereocenters and is not superimposable on its mirror image. In the context of complexes, this is often related to the arrangement of ligands around a central metal atom.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Square planar complexes can display optical isomerism only if all four ligands are identical.\n- Square planar complexes can indeed display optical isomerism, but this is not limited to having identical ligands. Optical isomerism can occur with different ligands as long as the arrangement around the central metal atom is chiral. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\nB. Tetrahedral complexes never display optical isomerism.\n- Tetrahedral complexes can display optical isomerism. For example, if the ligands are different, the arrangement can lead to chiral centers, resulting in optical isomerism. Thus, this statement is incorrect.\n\nC. Linear complexes can display optical isomerism when both ligands are different.\n- Linear complexes can indeed display optical isomerism if the ligands are different and the arrangement around the central metal atom is chiral. This is because the linear geometry can create a chiral environment, leading to optical isomerism. Therefore, this statement is correct.\n\nD. Octahedral complexes of monodentate ligands can display optical isomerism only when they have at least three different ligands.\n- Octahedral complexes can display optical isomerism with monodentate ligands as well. The presence of different ligands can create chiral centers, leading to optical isomerism. Thus, this statement is incorrect.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Linear complexes can display optical isomerism when both ligands are different.",
