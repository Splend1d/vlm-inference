            "content": "The question asks about the governmental reactions to complaints such as those seen in Source 2 before 1850. Source 2 is a Luddite song from around 1812, which reflects the sentiments of the Luddites, a group of textile workers who protested against the introduction of new machinery in the textile industry. The Luddites believed that the new machinery was leading to job losses and lower wages for workers.\n\nOption A suggests that governments did little to address problems of industrialization before 1850. This is a reasonable answer, as the Luddites' protests and the subsequent government response indicate that there were significant issues with industrialization that were not adequately addressed by the government.\n\nOption B suggests that reform movements led to the creation of regulations on work hours and ages and gender of workers. This is not directly related to the Luddites' protests, as the Luddites were primarily concerned with the impact of machinery on their jobs, not with regulations on work hours, ages, or gender.\n\nOption C suggests that the implementation of running water and sewers was begun in England. This is also not directly related to the Luddites' protests, as the Luddites were primarily concerned with the impact of machinery on their jobs, not with the implementation of running water and sewers.\n\nOption D suggests that the government created a national health-care system. This is not directly related to the Luddites' protests, as the Luddites were primarily concerned with the impact of machinery on their jobs, not with the creation of a national health-care system.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is option A. Governments did little to address problems of industrialization before 1850, as indicated by the Luddites' protests and the subsequent government response.\n\nSo, the final answer is $\\boxed{A}$.",
