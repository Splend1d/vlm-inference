            "content": "To understand how the greenhouse effect works, we need to consider the role of greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere. Greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and water vapor (H2O), are essential for maintaining the Earth's temperature.\n\n1. **Transmission of Visible Light**: Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere allow visible light from the Sun to pass through. This is crucial because visible light is the primary source of energy that heats the Earth's surface.\n\n2. **Absorption of Infrared Light**: Once the visible light reaches the Earth's surface, it is absorbed and re-emitted as infrared (IR) radiation. This IR radiation is a form of heat that is emitted back towards the atmosphere.\n\n3. **Trapping the Heat**: The greenhouse gases in the atmosphere absorb this IR radiation. They do not allow it to escape back into space, effectively trapping the heat near the Earth's surface. This process is known as the greenhouse effect.\n\n4. **Temperature Regulation**: By trapping heat, greenhouse gases help maintain the Earth's temperature, making it habitable. Without this effect, the Earth would be much colder, as the heat from the Sun would escape into space.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\n- **Option A**: Incorrect. Ozone does not transmit visible light; it absorbs UV light.\n- **Option B**: Correct. Greenhouse gases transmit visible light and absorb infrared light, trapping heat near the surface.\n- **Option C**: Incorrect. Greenhouse gases do not absorb infrared light from the Sun; they absorb heat emitted by the Earth's surface.\n- **Option D**: Incorrect. Greenhouse gases do not absorb X-rays and ultraviolet light; they absorb visible and infrared light.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B**: Greenhouse gases transmit visible light allowing it to heat the surface but then absorb infrared light from Earth trapping the heat near the surface.",
