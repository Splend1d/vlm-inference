            "content": "To find the difference in 13C NMR frequencies, we first need to determine the chemical shifts of benzene and chloroform in parts per million (ppm) on a 600 MHz spectrometer.\n\n1. **Convert ppm to Hz**:\n   - The frequency of the spectrometer is 600 MHz.\n   - 1 ppm is equivalent to 1000 Hz.\n   - Therefore, 1 ppm is equivalent to \\( \\frac{1000}{600} = \\frac{5}{3} \\) Hz.\n\n2. **Calculate the chemical shifts in Hz**:\n   - For benzene: \\( 128.4 \\text{ ppm} \\times \\frac{5}{3} \\text{ Hz/ppm} = 214 \\text{ Hz} \\).\n   - For chloroform: \\( 77.2 \\text{ ppm} \\times \\frac{5}{3} \\text{ Hz/ppm} = 128.67 \\text{ Hz} \\).\n\n3. **Find the difference in chemical shifts**:\n   - The difference is \\( 214 \\text{ Hz} - 128.67 \\text{ Hz} = 85.33 \\text{ Hz} \\).\n\n4. **Convert the difference to kHz**:\n   - 1 kHz = 1000 Hz.\n   - Therefore, \\( 85.33 \\text{ Hz} \\times \\frac{1}{1000} = 0.08533 \\text{ kHz} \\).\n\n5. **Round to the nearest whole number**:\n   - The closest option to 0.08533 kHz is 0.09 kHz.\n\nThus, the difference in the 13C NMR frequencies of benzene and chloroform on a 600 MHz spectrometer is approximately 91.6 kHz.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **C. 91.6 kHz**.",
