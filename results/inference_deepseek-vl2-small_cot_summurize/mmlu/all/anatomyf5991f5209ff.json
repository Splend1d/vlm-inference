It is not related to sleep patterns or daytime sleepiness.\n\nB. **Epilepsy**: Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures. While seizures can cause changes in consciousness, they are not specifically associated with uncontrollable daytime sleepiness.\n\nC. **Hydrocephalus**: Hydrocephalus is a condition where there is an accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain, leading to increased intracranial pressure. It is not related to sleepiness or daytime sleep episodes.\n\nD. **Narcolepsy**: Narcolepsy is a chronic sleep disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness and sudden attacks of sleep. These attacks can occur at any time, often without warning, and can last from a few seconds to several minutes. Narcolepsy is specifically associated with uncontrollable daytime sleepiness.\n\nAfter evaluating each option, the disorder characterized by uncontrollable episodes of falling asleep during the day is **D. Narcolepsy**.",
