            "content": "To determine which option is examined by looking at a goodness of fit statistic, let's first understand what a goodness of fit statistic is. A goodness of fit test is used to assess how well a statistical model explains the observed data. It helps in determining if the observed data fits the model well or not.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. How well the population regression function fits the data: This option refers to the overall fit of the population regression function to the entire dataset. It is not directly related to the goodness of fit statistic, which is used to evaluate the fit of a specific model to the data.\n\nB. How well the sample regression function fits the population regression function: This option is not a standard term in statistical analysis. It seems to be a confusion between the sample regression function and the population regression function. The goodness of fit statistic is not used to evaluate the fit of the sample regression function to the population regression function.\n\nC. How well the sample regression function fits the data: This option is the correct answer. The goodness of fit statistic is used to evaluate how well the sample regression function fits the data. It measures the difference between the observed data and the data predicted by the sample regression function. A smaller value of the goodness of fit statistic indicates a better fit.\n\nD. How well the population regression function fits the sample regression function: This option is not a standard term in statistical analysis. It seems to be a confusion between the population regression function and the sample regression function. The goodness of fit statistic is not used to evaluate the fit of the population regression function to the sample regression function.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. How well the sample regression function fits the data.",
