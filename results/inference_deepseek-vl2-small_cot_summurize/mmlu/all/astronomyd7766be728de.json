            "content": "To determine which phases of the Earth you would see if you lived on Venus, we need to consider the relative positions of the Earth and Venus in their orbits around the Sun.\n\n1. **Understanding the Orbits**:\n   - The Earth orbits the Sun in approximately 365.25 days.\n   - Venus orbits the Sun in approximately 224.7 days.\n\n2. **Relative Positions**:\n   - When the Earth is at a certain phase, Venus will be at a different phase relative to the Earth.\n   - For example, if the Earth is in the new moon phase, Venus will be in the new moon phase as well, but at a different position in its orbit.\n\n3. **Phases of Venus**:\n   - **New Moon**: Venus is between the Earth and the Sun.\n   - **Waxing Crescent**: Venus is moving away from the Sun.\n   - **First Quarter**: Venus is at a 90-degree angle to the Sun from the Earth.\n   - **Waxing Gibbous**: Venus is more than halfway through its orbit.\n   - **Full Moon**: Venus is on the opposite side of the Sun from the Earth.\n   - **Waning Gibbous**: Venus is moving towards the Sun.\n   - **Last Quarter**: Venus is at a 90-degree angle to the Sun from the Earth, but in the opposite direction.\n   - **Waning Crescent**: Venus is moving away from the Sun.\n\n4. **Analyzing the Options**:\n   - **Option A**: New first quarter full third quarter\n     - This sequence does not match the typical phases of Venus.\n   - **Option B**: Waning crescent New Waxing crescent\n     - This sequence does not match the typical phases of Venus.\n   - **Option C**: Waxing gibbous Full Waning gibbous\n     - This sequence does not match the typical phases of Venus.\n   - **Option D**: New only\n     - This sequence matches the typical phases of Venus.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **D. New only**.",
