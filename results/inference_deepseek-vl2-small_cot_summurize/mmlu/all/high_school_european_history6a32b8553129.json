One would find it hard to imagine how the laws of movement cause such frightful disasters in the best of possible worlds. A hundred thousand ants, our fellows, crushed all at once in our ant-hill, and half of them perishing, no doubt in unspeakable agony, beneath the wreckage from which they cannot be drawn. Families ruined all over Europe, the fortune of a hundred businessmen, your compatriots, swallowed up in the ruins of Lisbon. What a wretched gamble is the game of human life! What will the preachers say, especially if the palace of the Inquisition is still standing? I flatter myself that at least the reverend father inquisitors have been crushed like others. That ought to teach men not to persecute each other, for while a few holy scoundrels burn a few fanatics, the earth swallows up one and all.\n\u2014Voltaire, in a letter, 1755\nWhich of the following Enlightenment philosophes questioned reliance on reason and began the Romantic Movement for the rationale given?\n\nA. Jean-Jacques Rousseau because he thought society corrupted noble souls.\nB. Baron Montesquieu because he thought that governments were not capable of being fair.\nC. Mary Wollstonecraft because she railed against the subjugation of women emotionally.\nD. Adam Smith because he stated that reason could not be used to understand how another feels.\n",

            "content": "The quote provided is from Voltaire, a prominent Enlightenment philosopher. Voltaire was known for his skepticism towards the idea of absolute truth and his belief in the power of reason. He was also a critic of organized religion and the Inquisition. The quote reflects his view on the unpredictability of nature and the fragility of human life, which can be seen as a critique of the Enlightenment's reliance on reason to understand the world.\n\nHowever, the quote does not directly address the question of whether Voltaire questioned the reliance on reason or began the Romantic Movement. The Romantic Movement, which began in the late 18th century, was a reaction against the Enlightenment's emphasis on reason and science. It emphasized emotion, individualism, and the beauty of nature.\n\nAmong the options provided, Mary Wollstonecraft is the one who railed against the subjugation of women emotionally. She believed that women were not inferior to men, but were instead oppressed by society. Her ideas were a precursor to the Romantic Movement, which emphasized emotion and individualism.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Mary Wollstonecraft because she railed against the subjugation of women emotionally.\n\nSo, the final answer is $\\boxed{C}$.",
