            "content": "To determine the best explanation for the presence of gray-bodied, vestigial-winged flies among the progeny, we need to consider the genetic principles involved in Mendelian inheritance.\n\n1. **Understanding the Genotypes**:\n   - The female fruit fly has linked genes for a gray body and normal wings.\n   - The male fruit fly has linked genes for a black body and vestigial wings.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Phenotypes**:\n   - The female's phenotype is gray-bodied and normal-winged.\n   - The male's phenotype is black-bodied and vestigial-winged.\n\n3. **Genetic Linkage**:\n   - The genes for body color and wing structure are linked, meaning they are located close together on the same chromosome.\n   - This linkage means that the alleles for body color and wing structure are inherited together.\n\n4. **Crossing Over**:\n   - Crossing over occurs during meiosis, where homologous chromosomes exchange genetic material.\n   - This process can break the linkage between genes, allowing them to segregate independently during gamete formation.\n\n5. **Independent Assortment**:\n   - Independent assortment refers to the random orientation of chromosomes during meiosis.\n   - If crossing over occurs, it can lead to independent assortment, allowing the alleles for body color and wing structure to segregate independently.\n\n6. **Segregation of Alleles**:\n   - Segregation of alleles is the process by which alleles separate during gamete formation.\n   - If crossing over occurs, it can lead to segregation of alleles, resulting in a mix of phenotypes in the progeny.\n\n7. **Penetrance**:\n   - Penetrance refers to the proportion of individuals in a population that express a particular trait.\n   - It does not explain the presence of a new phenotype in the progeny.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the presence of gray-bodied, vestigial-winged flies among the progeny is best explained by:\n\nB. independent assortment\n\nIndependent assortment allows the alleles for body color and wing structure to segregate independently, leading to the formation of a new phenotype in the progeny.",
