            "content": "To determine which plant cell undergoes programmed cell death (PCD) to become functional, we need to understand the roles of each option:\n\nA. **Phloem sieve tube member**: Phloem sieve tube members are specialized cells in the phloem that transport nutrients throughout the plant. They do not undergo PCD; instead, they are continuously renewed by the activity of sieve elements and companion cells.\n\nB. **Xylem vessel member**: Xylem vessel members are responsible for the transport of water and dissolved minerals from the roots to the rest of the plant. Like phloem sieve tube members, they do not undergo PCD. They are also continuously renewed by the activity of tracheids and vessel elements.\n\nC. **Stomatal guard cell**: Stomatal guard cells control the opening and closing of stomata, which are small openings on the surface of leaves that facilitate gas exchange. These cells undergo PCD to allow the stomata to open and close as needed. This process is crucial for regulating gas exchange, transpiration, and water conservation.\n\nD. **Root cap cell**: Root cap cells are located at the tips of roots and protect the root as it grows through the soil. They do not undergo PCD; instead, they are continuously renewed by the activity of root cap cells.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Stomatal guard cell\n\nStomatal guard cells undergo programmed cell death to become functional, allowing them to regulate gas exchange and maintain the plant's water balance.",
