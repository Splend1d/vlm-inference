For it to be true, the antecedent (C) must be true, and the consequent (D \u2228 C) must also be true.\n   - From the truth table, we see that C \u2283 (D \u2228 C) is true in all cases where C is true.\n\n2. **C \u00b7 ~D**:\n   - This is a conjunction statement. For it to be true, both conjuncts (C and ~D) must be true.\n   - From the truth table, we see that C \u00b7 ~D is true only when C is true and ~D is false.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- **Logically Equivalent**: The two propositions are not logically equivalent because they do not have the same truth values in all cases.\n- **Contradictory**: The two propositions are not contradictory because they do not have opposite truth values in all cases.\n- **Neither logically equivalent nor contradictory, but consistent**: This is not applicable here because the propositions are not consistent.\n- **Inconsistent**: The two propositions are inconsistent because they do not have the same truth values in all cases.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD.
