This process requires three main components: light, carbon dioxide (CO2), and water (H2O).\n\n- **Light**: This is the energy source that drives the photosynthesis process. It is absorbed by chlorophyll and other pigments in the plant cells.\n- **Carbon dioxide (CO2)**: This is a key component of the carbon cycle and is absorbed from the atmosphere through the stomata (pores) on the leaves.\n- **Water (H2O)**: This is absorbed by the roots from the soil and transported to the leaves, where it is used in the photosynthesis process.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nB. light, CO2, water",
