A shorter workweek made time for a commute possible.  \n- Suburbanization often occurred because people could work from home or have flexible schedules, allowing them to live farther from their workplaces. A shorter workweek would not necessarily contribute to suburbanization, as it might encourage people to live closer to their jobs.\n\nB. Changes in the housing mortgage regulations made home ownership easier.  \n- Suburbanization was significantly influenced by the availability of mortgages, which allowed more people to afford homes in suburban areas. Easier mortgage regulations would indeed contribute to suburbanization.\n\nC. Fixed-route public transit routes increased in importance.  \n- As public transit became more reliable and accessible, it encouraged people to live farther from their workplaces, thus contributing to suburbanization.\n\nD. Improved automobiles made transportation easier and less limited.  \n- The widespread availability of automobiles made it easier for people to commute to work and travel longer distances, which was a major driver of suburbanization.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the statement that does NOT describe a factor contributing to suburbanization is:\n\nA. A shorter workweek made time for a commute possible.",
