This means that if the president or the executive branch passed a resolution, Congress could pass a concurrent resolution that would effectively nullify that resolution. This was a way for Congress to check the power of the executive branch and ensure that the legislative branch had the final say in the matter.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. Congress to nullify resolutions approved by the executive branch.",
