            "content": "To determine the best strategy for maintaining homeostasis of the plasma membrane in response to temperature changes, we need to consider how the fluidity of the membrane is affected by temperature.\n\n- **Option A: Increase the concentration of solutes in the cytosol.** Increasing solute concentration in the cytosol can affect the osmotic pressure, but it does not directly alter the fluidity of the plasma membrane itself. Therefore, this option is not effective for maintaining membrane fluidity.\n\n- **Option B: Change the ratio of phospholipids with double covalent bonds in their tails to those without double covalent bonds in their tails.** Phospholipids with double covalent bonds in their tails are more rigid and less fluid than those with single covalent bonds. By increasing the proportion of double-bonded phospholipids, the membrane becomes more rigid and less fluid, which is beneficial at lower temperatures. Conversely, reducing the proportion of double-bonded phospholipids increases fluidity at higher temperatures. This strategy allows the membrane to adjust its fluidity to match the environmental temperature, thus maintaining homeostasis.\n\n- **Option C: Replace phospholipids with glucose molecules.** Replacing phospholipids with glucose molecules is not a viable strategy because glucose is not a structural component of the membrane and cannot provide the necessary fluidity and structural integrity.\n\n- **Option D: Exchange phospholipids from one side of the plasma membrane to the other.** While this option might seem plausible, it is not a viable strategy because the plasma membrane is a continuous structure, and exchanging phospholipids from one side to the other would disrupt the membrane's integrity and function.\n\nAfter evaluating each option, the most effective strategy for maintaining homeostasis of the plasma membrane in response to temperature changes is:\n\n**B. Change the ratio of phospholipids with double covalent bonds in their tails to those without double covalent bonds in their tails.**",
