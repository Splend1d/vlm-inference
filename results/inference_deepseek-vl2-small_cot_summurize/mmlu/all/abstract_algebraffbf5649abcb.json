The statement is incorrect because it misrepresents the formula for the size of the product of two subgroups. The correct formula is:\n\n\\[ |HK| = |H||K| / |H \\cap K| \\]\n\nThis formula is derived from Lagrange's theorem, which states that the order of the product of two subgroups is the product of their orders divided by the order of their intersection. Therefore, the statement is false.\n\n**Statement 2:** A group of order \\( 2p \\) where \\( p \\) is an odd prime is cyclic or isomorphic to \\( D_p \\).\n\nTo determine the truth of this statement, we need to understand the properties of groups of order \\( 2p \\). \n\n- If \\( p \\) is an odd prime, then \\( 2p \\) is even. According to the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, every finite abelian group of order \\( 2p \\) is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order \\( p \\).\n- A cyclic group of order \\( 2p \\) is isomorphic to \\( \\mathbb{Z}_{2p} \\).\n- A group isomorphic to \\( D_p \\) (the dihedral group of order \\( 2p \\)) is also cyclic.\n\nTherefore, the statement is true.\n\nGiven the analysis:\n- Statement 1 is false.\n- Statement 2 is true.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nD.
