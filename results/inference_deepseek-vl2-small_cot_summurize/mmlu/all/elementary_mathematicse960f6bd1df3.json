The least common multiple of 2 and 5 is 10.\n   - Convert each fraction to have a denominator of 10:\n     - \\( \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1 \\times 5}{2 \\times 5} = \\frac{5}{10} \\)\n     - \\( \\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{2 \\times 2}{5 \\times 2} = \\frac{4}{10} \\)\n\n3. **Add the fractions:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{5}{10} + \\frac{4}{10} = \\frac{9}{10}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Interpret the result:**\n   - The fraction \\( \\frac{9}{10} \\) represents the proportion of the cans of soup that are either tomato or chicken noodle.\n\nTherefore, the fraction of the cans of soup in Rolando\u2019s cupboard that are either tomato or chicken noodle is \\( \\frac{9}{10} \\).\n\nThe correct answer is \\( \\boxed{A} \\).",
