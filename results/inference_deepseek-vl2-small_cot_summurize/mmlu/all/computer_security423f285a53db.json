This process ensures that the message has not been tampered with and that it indeed came from the sender.\n\n- **Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)**: This is the framework that uses public and private keys to secure communications. The public key is used to verify the signature, while the private key is used to create the signature.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Receiver\u2019s Public Key",
