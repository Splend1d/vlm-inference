            "content": "Let's analyze each statement one by one:\n\nA. Every equivalence relation is a partial-ordering relation.\n\nThis statement is false. An equivalence relation is a relation that is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. A partial-ordering relation is a relation that is reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive. While all equivalence relations are partial-orderings, not all partial-orderings are equivalence relations. For example, the relation \"is a subset of\" on a set of sets is a partial-ordering, but it is not an equivalence relation because it is not reflexive (a set is not a subset of itself).\n\nB. Number of relations form A = {x, y, z} to B= (1, 2), is 64.\n\nThis statement is false. The number of relations from a set of elements to another set is not 64. The number of relations from a set of elements to another set is the number of subsets of the first set, which is 2^n, where n is the number of elements in the first set. In this case, n = 3, so the number of relations is 2^3 = 8.\n\nC. Empty relation _ is reflexive\n\nThis statement is true. An empty relation is a relation that has no elements. Since there are no elements in an empty relation, it is reflexive (a relation is reflexive if it contains a pair (a, a) for every element a in the domain).\n\nD. Properties of a relation being symmetric and being un-symmetric are negative of each other.\n\nThis statement is false. Symmetry and antisymmetry are not negative of each other. Symmetry means that if a relation holds from x to y, then it also holds from y to x. Antisymmetry means that if a relation holds from x to y and from y to x, then it must hold from x to y and from y to x. These are not negative properties; they are distinct properties of a relation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.",
