The activity of a radioactive substance decreases over time according to the half-life, which is the time it takes for half of the substance to decay.\n\nGiven:\n- Initial activity = 150 mCi\n- Half-life = 6.0 hours\n\nWe need to find the activity after 24 hours.\n\n1. **Calculate the number of half-lives in 24 hours:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of half-lives} = \\frac{\\text{Total time}}{\\text{Half-life}} = \\frac{24 \\text{ hours}}{6.0 \\text{ hours/half-life}} = 4 \\text{ half-lives}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Apply the formula for radioactive decay:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Final activity} = \\text{Initial activity} \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{\\text{number of half-lives}}\n   \\]\n   Substituting the values:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Final activity} = 150 \\text{ mCi} \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^4\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^4\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^4 = \\frac{1}{16}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Multiply the initial activity by \\(\\frac{1}{16}\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Final activity} = 150 \\text{ mCi} \\times \\frac{1}{16} = 9.375 \\text{ mCi}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Round to the nearest whole number:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Final activity} \\approx 9.4 \\text{ mCi}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the activity remaining after 24 hours is approximately 9.4 mCi.\n\nThe correct answer is **D. 9.4 mCi**.",
