This is because the scale is designed to provide precise measurements, and 1 mmHg is the smallest unit that can be accurately measured and displayed.\n\n2. **Aneroid Sphygmomanometer**:\n   - Aneroid sphygmomanometers are mechanical devices that use a metal diaphragm to measure blood pressure.\n   - The smallest increment on an aneroid sphygmomanometer is usually 2 mmHg. This is because the mechanical nature of the device means that the smallest increment is determined by the mechanical resolution of the device itself.\n\nGiven this information, the smallest increments on a mercury and aneroid sphygmomanometer are:\n\n- Mercury: 1 mmHg\n- Aneroid: 2 mmHg\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 2 mmHg.",
