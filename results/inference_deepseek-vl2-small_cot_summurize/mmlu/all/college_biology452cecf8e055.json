            "content": "To understand how marine birds maintain their internal osmolarity, we need to consider the osmotic environment they live in. Seawater is hyperosmotic compared to the internal environment of the birds. This means that the concentration of solutes in seawater is higher than in the birds' blood.\n\nTo counteract this, marine birds have developed a unique physiological adaptation. They have specialized salt-exchange glands located in their nasal cavity. These glands are highly efficient at absorbing salts from the seawater they drink. This absorption process helps to dilute the salts in their blood, making it hypoosmotic compared to seawater.\n\nOnce the salts are absorbed, the birds excrete the excess salts through their nasal glands. This excretion process is crucial because it prevents the accumulation of excess salts in their bodies, which could lead to dehydration and other health issues.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. This option suggests that birds absorb water and produce dilute urine. While water absorption is part of their strategy, the focus is on salt absorption, not water.\n\nB. This option correctly describes the process: birds absorb salts from seawater and excrete concentrated urine. This is the correct explanation for how they maintain their internal osmolarity.\n\nC. This option suggests excreting salts and small volumes of urine, which is incorrect. The primary excretion method is through the nasal glands, not the kidneys.\n\nD. This option suggests excreting salts and nitrogenous wastes through nasal glands, which is incorrect. The primary focus is on salt excretion, not nitrogenous waste.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Marine birds absorb salts from the environment through specialized salt-exchange glands and produce large volumes of concentrated urine in the kidneys.",
