Decreased exploration when the mother is out of the room.\n- Exploration is a normal behavior for young children as they learn about their environment. A decrease in exploration could indicate anxiety or stress, but it is not necessarily concerning unless it is accompanied by other signs of distress.\n\nB. Crying and returning to the mother upon return.\n- Crying and seeking comfort from the mother upon her return is a common response to separation anxiety. This behavior is generally not concerning unless it is persistent or accompanied by other signs of distress.\n\nC. Avoiding the mother upon return.\n- Avoiding the mother upon her return could indicate a deeper issue, such as attachment problems or fear of the psychologist. This behavior is concerning because it suggests a lack of comfort or trust in the mother's presence.\n\nD. Exploring the room before the mother leaves.\n- Exploring the room before the mother leaves is a normal behavior as the child is trying to understand the environment and the mother's absence. This is not concerning unless it is accompanied by other signs of distress.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the most concerning sign would be:\n\nC. Avoiding the mother upon return.",
