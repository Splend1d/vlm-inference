Metallic element: Silicon is not typically found as a free metallic element in nature. It is more commonly found in compounds rather than in its elemental form.\n\nB. Sulfide: Silicon can form sulfides, such as silicon sulfide (SiS), but these are not the most common forms found in nature.\n\nC. Fluoride: Silicon does not typically form fluoride compounds in nature. Fluorine is a highly reactive element and does not commonly combine with silicon in stable compounds.\n\nD. Oxide: Silicon dioxide (SiO\u2082), commonly known as quartz, is the most common naturally-occurring form of silicon. It is abundant in the Earth's crust and is a major component of sand, granite, and other rocks.\n\nTherefore, the most common naturally-occurring form of silicon is:\n\nD. Oxide",
