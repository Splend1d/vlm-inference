            "content": "To determine the relationship between the concentrations of the conjugate acid and base in a solution, we need to understand the concept of pKa and the behavior of weak acids.\n\n1. **Understanding pKa**: The pKa of a weak acid is a measure of its strength. A lower pKa value indicates a stronger acid, meaning it dissociates more in solution.\n\n2. **Given pKa and pH**: The pKa of nitrous acid (HNO2) is 3.3. The pH of the solution is 4.2.\n\n3. **Relationship between pH and pKa**: The pH of a solution is related to the pKa of the acid by the equation:\n   \\[\n   \\text{pH} = \\text{pKa} + \\log \\left( \\frac{[\\text{A}^-]}{[\\text{HA}]} \\right)\n   \\]\n   where [A^-] is the concentration of the conjugate base and [HA] is the concentration of the weak acid.\n\n4. **Calculating the ratio**:\n   \\[\n   4.2 = 3.3 + \\log \\left( \\frac{[\\text{A}^-]}{[\\text{HA}]} \\right)\n   \\]\n   Solving for the ratio:\n   \\[\n   \\log \\left( \\frac{[\\text{A}^-]}{[\\text{HA}]} \\right) = 4.2 - 3.3 = 0.9\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\frac{[\\text{A}^-]}{[\\text{HA}]} = 10^{0.9}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Interpreting the ratio**: Since the ratio \\( \\frac{[\\text{A}^-]}{[\\text{HA}]} \\) is greater than 1, it indicates that the concentration of the conjugate base [A^-] is greater than the concentration of the weak acid [HA].\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. [NO2-] > [HNO2]\n\nThis means that the concentration of the nitrous acid (HNO2) is less than the concentration of its conjugate base (NO2-).",
