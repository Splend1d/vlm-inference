It is not a component of connective tissue; rather, it is a protein that plays a crucial role in hemostasis.\n\nB. **Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs)**: These are long, unbranched polysaccharides that are abundant in connective tissue. They provide structural support and help retain water, contributing to the tissue's resilience and elasticity.\n\nC. **Collagens**: Collagen is a major structural protein found in connective tissue. It provides tensile strength and is a key component of the extracellular matrix, making it essential for the structural integrity of tissues.\n\nD. **Fibroblasts**: Fibroblasts are cells that produce and maintain the extracellular matrix and collagen in connective tissue. They are integral to the synthesis and repair of connective tissue.\n\nGiven this analysis, thrombin is the only option that is not typically found in connective tissue. It is a protein involved in blood clotting, not a component of connective tissue.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. thrombin",
