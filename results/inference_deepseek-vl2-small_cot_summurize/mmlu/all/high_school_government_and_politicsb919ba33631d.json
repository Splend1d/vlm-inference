            "content": "The \"separate but equal\" doctrine was established in the Supreme Court decision of Plessy v. Ferguson.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Plessy v. Ferguson (1896)**: This case is the landmark decision where the Supreme Court ruled that \"separate but equal\" facilities were constitutional. The decision allowed for racial segregation in public facilities, such as schools and transportation, as long as the facilities were equal in quality. This doctrine was later declared unconstitutional by the Brown v. Board of Education decision in 1954.\n\nB. **McCulloch v. Maryland (1819)**: This case established the principle of state sovereignty and the concept of implied powers, but it did not address racial segregation.\n\nC. **Gibbons v. Ogden (1824)**: This case dealt with the regulation of interstate commerce, specifically the navigation of the Hudson River. It did not involve racial segregation.\n\nD. **Brown v. Board of Education (1954)**: This case was a landmark decision that declared state laws establishing separate public schools for black and white students to be unconstitutional. It effectively overturned the \"separate but equal\" doctrine established in Plessy v. Ferguson.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. Plessy v. Ferguson.",
