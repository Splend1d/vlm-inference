In this context, Mary's situation does not involve mutual benefit for all parties. She has convenience without privacy, which is not a situation where everyone is happy.\n\nB. **Trade-off**: This term describes a situation where one advantage is balanced against another. Mary's situation is a classic example of a trade-off because she gains the convenience of not needing a car (which is a significant advantage) but at the cost of reduced privacy. This is a common scenario where one benefit is offset by another.\n\nC. **Infill**: This term generally refers to the development of land within an existing urban area, often to increase density and reduce urban sprawl. Mary's situation does not relate to urban development patterns.\n\nD. **Leapfrog development**: This term describes a development pattern where infrastructure is built to a higher standard than necessary, often to avoid future upgrades. Mary's situation does not involve infrastructure planning or development.\n\nAfter evaluating each option, the correct answer is **B. trade-off**. Mary experiences a trade-off between the convenience of not needing a car and the lack of privacy, which is a common scenario in urban living.",
