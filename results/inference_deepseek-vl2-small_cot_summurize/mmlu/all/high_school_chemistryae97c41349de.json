            "content": "To determine which oxo acid is the strongest acid, we need to consider the acidity of the oxo group (the -O- group) in each compound. The acidity of an oxo acid is influenced by the electronegativity of the oxygen atom and the ability of the oxo group to stabilize the negative charge after deprotonation.\n\n1. **HBrO**: The oxo group in HBrO is bonded to a bromine atom. Bromine is less electronegative than oxygen, which means it is less effective at stabilizing the negative charge after deprotonation. Therefore, HBrO is a weaker acid compared to others with more electronegative oxygen atoms.\n\n2. **HClO**: The oxo group in HClO is bonded to a chlorine atom. Chlorine is more electronegative than bromine, which means it is more effective at stabilizing the negative charge after deprotonation. This makes HClO a stronger acid than HBrO.\n\n3. **HIO**: The oxo group in HIO is bonded to an iodine atom. Iodine is even more electronegative than chlorine, which means it is even more effective at stabilizing the negative charge after deprotonation. This makes HIO the strongest acid among the given options.\n\n4. **HClO3**: The oxo group in HClO3 is bonded to a chlorine atom. Although chlorine is more electronegative than bromine, it is less electronegative than iodine. Therefore, HClO3 is a weaker acid than HIO but stronger than HBrO.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the strongest acid among the given options is **HIO** because the iodine atom in the oxo group is the most electronegative, making it the most effective at stabilizing the negative charge after deprotonation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **C. HIO**.",
