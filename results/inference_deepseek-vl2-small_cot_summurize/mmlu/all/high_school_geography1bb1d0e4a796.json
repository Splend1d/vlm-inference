They require quick distribution to maintain freshness and quality. Therefore, dairy companies typically need to be close to their markets to ensure timely delivery and minimize spoilage.\n\nB. **Bulk-gaining products**: These products, such as grains and seeds, are often stored for long periods. While they may need to be transported over long distances, they do not require the same level of proximity to markets as perishable goods. Therefore, bulk-gaining products can often be transported from distant locations without significant impact on their quality.\n\nC. **Single-market products**: These products are typically manufactured and sold in a single geographic area. They do not require transportation to other markets, so they can be produced and sold locally without needing to be close to their markets.\n\nD. **Bulk-reducing products**: These products, such as sugar and salt, are often stored for long periods. While they may be transported over long distances, they do not need to be as close to their markets as perishable goods. However, they still benefit from being near their markets to ensure efficient distribution and minimize transportation costs.\n\nBased on this analysis, the industry that does NOT need to be close to its markets is:\n\nC. Single-market products",
