It seems there might be a mistake in the options or the question itself. If we assume that the question is asking for the speed of light in a nonmagnetic dielectric material with a dielectric constant of 4.0, the correct answer should be:\n\nv = 7.5 x 10^7 m/s\n\nBut since this is not an option, we cannot provide a correct answer based on the given options.",
