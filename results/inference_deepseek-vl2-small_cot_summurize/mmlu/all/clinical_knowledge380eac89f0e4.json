            "content": "To determine which factor does not influence success in sport, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Ability to tolerate heavy training without succumbing to illness or injury: This is a crucial factor in sport success. Athletes need to be physically fit and resilient to endure rigorous training schedules without getting sick or injured. This resilience ensures they can maintain their performance levels and avoid setbacks.\n\nB. Tactics: Tactics are essential in sports as they involve strategic planning and execution. Successful athletes often have a deep understanding of game strategies, which can give them a competitive edge. Tactics help in making quick decisions during the game, which can be the difference between winning and losing.\n\nC. The diet: Nutrition plays a significant role in an athlete's performance. A well-balanced diet provides the necessary energy, nutrients, and recovery support required for optimal performance. Poor nutrition can lead to fatigue, decreased performance, and increased risk of injury.\n\nD. Ingestion of carnitine during exercise: Carnitine is a supplement that athletes sometimes use to enhance endurance and reduce fatigue during exercise. However, its effectiveness in improving performance is debated, and its impact on success in sports is not universally accepted. Some studies suggest it may have benefits, while others do not. Therefore, its influence on success in sport is not as consistent or widely recognized as the other factors.\n\nBased on this analysis, the factor that does not influence success in sport is:\n\nD. Ingestion of carnitine during exercise.",
