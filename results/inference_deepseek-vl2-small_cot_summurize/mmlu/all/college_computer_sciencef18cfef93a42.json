A set of Boolean operators is complete if it can represent all possible Boolean expressions using only the operators in the set.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. {AND, NOT}\n- The set {AND, NOT} can represent all Boolean expressions because NOT can be used to negate any expression, and AND can be used to combine multiple expressions. For example, NOT(A AND B) is equivalent to (A OR NOT B), and NOT(A OR B) is equivalent to (A AND NOT B).\n\nB. {NOT, OR}\n- The set {NOT, OR} can also represent all Boolean expressions. NOT can be used to negate any expression, and OR can be used to combine multiple expressions. For example, NOT(A OR B) is equivalent to (A AND NOT B), and NOT(A AND B) is equivalent to (A OR NOT B).\n\nC. {AND, OR}\n- The set {AND, OR} is not complete because it cannot represent all Boolean expressions. For example, the expression NOT(A AND B) cannot be represented using only AND and OR.\n\nD. {NAND}\n- The set {NAND} is complete because NAND is a combination of NOT and AND, which can represent all Boolean expressions. For example, NOT(A AND B) is equivalent to (A OR NOT B), and NOT(A OR B) is equivalent to (A AND NOT B).\n\nTherefore, the set that is NOT complete is C. {AND, OR}.",
