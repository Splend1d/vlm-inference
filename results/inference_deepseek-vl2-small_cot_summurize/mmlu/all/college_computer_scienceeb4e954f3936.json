This ambiguity can lead to multiple possible parse trees for a given string, making it difficult to determine a single, unique parse tree.\n\nNow, let's consider the suitability of the grammar for top-down and bottom-up parsing.\n\nTop-down parsing is a method where the parser starts with the most general production rule and tries to match the input string against it. If the input string does not match the production rule, the parser moves to the next more specific production rule.\n\nBottom-up parsing, on the other hand, is a method where the parser starts with the most specific production rule and tries to match the input string against it. If the input string does not match the production rule, the parser moves to the next more general production rule.\n\nGiven the ambiguity in the grammar, it is not suitable for top-down parsing because the parser may not be able to determine a single parse tree. However, it is suitable for bottom-up parsing because the parser can start with the most specific production rule and try to match the input string against it.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nC.
