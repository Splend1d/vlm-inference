Therefore, ~O \u2283 P is true (T).\n  - When O is false (F), ~O is true (T), and P is true (T). Therefore, ~O \u2283 P is true (T).\n\n- For **O \u2228 P**:\n  - When O is true (T) and P is true (T), O \u2228 P is true (T).\n  - When O is true (T) and P is false (F), O \u2228 P is true (T).\n  - When O is false (F) and P is true (T), O \u2228 P is true (T).\n  - When O is false (F) and P is false (F), O \u2228 P is false (F).\n\nFrom the truth tables, we can see that:\n- **~O \u2283 P** is true in all cases.\n- **O \u2228 P** is true in all cases except when both O and P are false.\n\nSince both statements are true in all cases, they are **logically equivalent**.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA.
