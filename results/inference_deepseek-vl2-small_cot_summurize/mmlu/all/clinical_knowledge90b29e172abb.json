A high energy diet and large appetite: While nutrition is important for athletes, it is not the primary determinant of success. A balanced diet is crucial, but it is not the sole factor.\n\nB. High intelligence and motivation to succeed: Intelligence can be beneficial in understanding strategies and tactics, but it is not the primary factor. Motivation is important, but it is not the only factor.\n\nC. A good coach and the motivation to succeed: A good coach can provide guidance, strategies, and motivation, but without the innate ability and capacity to respond to training, success may not be achieved.\n\nD. Innate ability and the capacity to respond to the training stimulus: This option encompasses both the natural talent and the ability to improve through training. Innate ability provides a foundation, while the capacity to respond to training stimulus allows for growth and improvement.\n\nConsidering the analysis, the main factors determining success in sport are:\n\nD. innate ability and the capacity to respond to the training stimulus.",
