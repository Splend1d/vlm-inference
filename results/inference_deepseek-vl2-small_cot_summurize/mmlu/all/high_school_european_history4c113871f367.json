            "content": "The text describes the new arrangements made by Tsar Alexander II in 1861, which included the abolition of serfdom in Russia. The serfs were granted the full rights of free rural inhabitants, including the right to purchase their household plots and acquire full ownership of the arable lands and other properties for permanent use. They were also granted the right to purchase their household plots and, with the consent of the nobles, they may acquire in full ownership the arable lands and other properties which are allotted them for permanent use. Following such acquisition of full ownership of land, the peasants will be freed from their obligations to the nobles for the land thus purchased and will become free peasant landowners.\n\nThe text also mentions the organization of Peace Offices on the estates of the nobles, leaving the village communes as they are, and to open cantonal offices in the large villages and unite small village communes. It also mentions the formulation, verification, and confirmation in each village commune or estate a charter which will specify, on the basis of local conditions, the amount of land allotted to the peasants for permanent use, and the scope of their obligations to the nobleman for the land.\n\nFrom the above information, we can infer that the long-term effects of Tsar Alexander II's emancipation were that the former serfs were granted the right to purchase their household plots and acquire full ownership of the arable lands and other properties for permanent use. This would have led to the peasants becoming free peasant landowners, which would have had a positive impact on their economic status.\n\nTherefore, the best description of the long-term effects of Tsar Alexander II's emancipation is option A: Food production soared, which allowed Russians to export agricultural goods while investing the profits into their industrial sector.\n\nSo, the final answer is $\\boxed{A}$.",
