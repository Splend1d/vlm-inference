This law applies to all objects, regardless of their mass, and explains why the acceleration of free fall is the same for all masses.\n\nNewton's first law, also known as the law of inertia, states that an object at rest will remain at rest, and an object in motion will continue in its state of motion, unless acted upon by an external force. This law does not explain the acceleration of free fall.\n\nNewton's third law states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. This law applies to interactions between objects, but does not explain the acceleration of free fall.\n\nNewton's law of action-reaction is a specific application of Newton's third law, and does not explain the acceleration of free fall.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. second law.",
