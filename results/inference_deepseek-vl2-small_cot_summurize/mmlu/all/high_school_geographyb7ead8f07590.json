These cities were planned and built as new capitals for their respective countries, reflecting a forward-looking approach to urban development and governance.\n\n- **Ankara, Turkey**: Ankara was chosen as the capital of Turkey in 1923, replacing Istanbul, which had been the capital for centuries. The city was designed to be a modern, planned capital with wide boulevards, government buildings, and a central park.\n\n- **Islamabad, Pakistan**: Islamabad was established as the capital of Pakistan in 1960, replacing Karachi. The city was planned to be a modern, planned capital with a central axis, government buildings, and a green belt.\n\nThese cities were not old colonial capitals (Option C) or rival cities (Option D). They were not desert cities (Option A) either, as both cities have a temperate climate.",
