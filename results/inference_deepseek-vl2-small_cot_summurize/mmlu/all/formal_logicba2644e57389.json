The statement can be broken down as follows:\n\n1. \"All children\" can be represented as a universal quantifier over the set of children.\n2. \"go to some school\" can be represented as a conjunction of two conditions:\n   - \"x is a child\" (Cx)\n   - \"x goes to y\" (Gxy)\n\nThus, the statement can be translated into the following logical form:\n\n\\[\n\\forall x \\left( \\exists y (Cx \\land Gxy) \\right)\n\\]\n\nThis translates to:\n\n\\[\n\\forall x \\left( \\exists y (Cx \\land Gxy) \\right)\n\\]\n\nNow, let's evaluate each of the given options:\n\nA. \\((\\forall x)(\\exists y)[(Cx \\cdot Sy) \\cdot Gxy)\\)\n   - This option uses a conjunction of two conditions, which is not the correct logical form for the statement.\n\nB. \\((\\forall x)[Sx \\to (\\exists y)(Cy \\cdot Gxy)]\\)\n   - This option uses a conditional statement, which is not the correct logical form for the statement.\n\nC. \\((\\forall x)[Cx \\to (\\exists y)(Sy \\cdot Gxy)]\\)\n   - This option uses a conditional statement, which is not the correct logical form for the statement.\n\nD. \\((\\forall x)[Sx \\cdot (\\exists y)(Cy \\cdot Gxy)]\\)\n   - This option uses a conjunction of two conditions, which is not the correct logical form for the statement.\n\nThe correct translation of the statement \"All children go to some school\" into predicate logic is:\n\n\\[\n\\forall x \\left( \\exists y (Cx \\land Gxy) \\right)\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{A}\n\\]",
