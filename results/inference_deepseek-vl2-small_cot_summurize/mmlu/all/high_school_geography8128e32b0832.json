It is measured in degrees and is used to determine the position of a point on the Earth's surface relative to the equator. The equator itself is at 0 degrees latitude, and as you move north or south from the equator, the latitude increases or decreases, respectively.\n\nA. global grid system: This is not a specific measurement of distance.\nB. Prime Meridian: This is a line of longitude that runs from the North Pole to the South Pole and is at 0 degrees longitude.\nD. longitude: This is a measurement of distance east or west from the Prime Meridian, not north or south.",
