The statement is:\n\n48 m = Box mm\n\nThis can be written as:\n\n48 m = 48,000 mm\n\nNow, we need to find the number that makes this statement true. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 48:\n\n48,000 mm / 48 = Box mm\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n1,000 mm = Box mm\n\nTherefore, the number that makes the statement true is 1,000. However, this is not one of the options provided. Let's re-examine the options:\n\nA. 48,000\nB. 480\nC. 4,800\nD. 5\n\nThe correct answer is not listed among the options. However, if we consider the context of the problem, it seems that the statement is asking for the number that makes the conversion from meters to millimeters true. In that case, the correct answer would be:\n\nA. 48,000\n\nThis is because 48,000 mm is the correct conversion factor from meters to millimeters.",
