            "content": "To determine voter eligibility requirements, we need to understand the structure of the U.S. government and the role of each branch.\n\nThe U.S. Constitution outlines the framework of the federal government, dividing power among three branches: the legislative, executive, and judicial branches.\n\n1. **Legislative Branch**: This branch is responsible for making laws. Congress, which consists of the Senate and the House of Representatives, has the authority to pass laws, including those related to voting.\n\n2. **Executive Branch**: The President, as the head of the executive branch, can influence policy through executive orders and recommendations, but cannot unilaterally change laws.\n\n3. **Judicial Branch**: The Supreme Court and other federal courts interpret laws and can rule on their constitutionality.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **The President**: While the President can influence policy and may sign or veto legislation, they do not have the authority to set voter eligibility requirements.\n\nB. **Congress**: As the legislative branch, Congress has the power to enact laws, including those related to voting. This includes determining voter eligibility requirements.\n\nC. **State legislatures**: While states have some control over voting laws, the Constitution grants Congress the authority to set minimum standards for voting, such as requiring states to allow all citizens to vote who are at least 18 years old.\n\nD. **Federal administrative agencies**: These agencies are responsible for enforcing laws and regulations but do not have the authority to set voter eligibility requirements.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Congress\n\nCongress has the constitutional authority to set voter eligibility requirements, ensuring that states adhere to a standard set by the federal government.",
