            "content": "To determine which option is NOT a feature of continuously compounded returns, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **They can be interpreted as continuously compounded changes in the prices**: This is a fundamental feature of continuously compounded returns. The log-returns, which are used to calculate continuously compounded returns, represent the rate of change in the logarithm of the price over a period. This allows for the use of calculus to model and analyze financial instruments.\n\nB. **They can be added over time to give returns for longer time periods**: This is also true. The sum of continuously compounded returns over time can be used to calculate the total return over a period, which is a key concept in finance.\n\nC. **They can be added across a portfolio of assets to give portfolio returns**: This is another feature of continuously compounded returns. The returns on individual assets in a portfolio can be compounded continuously to find the overall portfolio return.\n\nD. **They are usually fat-tailed**: This statement is incorrect. Fat-tailed distributions are typically associated with returns that have extreme values, such as those seen in financial crises or market crashes. Continuous compounding returns are generally more stable and do not exhibit fat-tailed behavior.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. The returns from continuously compounded interest are not typically fat-tailed.",
