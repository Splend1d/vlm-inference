            "content": "To determine which half-reactions are reductions, we need to identify the species that is being reduced. Reduction involves the gain of electrons.\n\n1. **Cu2+ + e- \u2192 Cu+**:\n   - In this reaction, copper(II) ions (Cu2+) gain an electron to form copper ions (Cu+).\n   - This is a reduction process because the copper ions are gaining electrons.\n\n2. **Cu+ + e- \u2192 Cu0**:\n   - Here, copper ions (Cu+) gain an electron to form copper metal (Cu0).\n   - This is also a reduction process because the copper ions are gaining electrons.\n\n3. **Fe2+ \u2192 Fe3+ + e-**:\n   - In this reaction, iron(II) ions (Fe2+) lose an electron to form iron(III) ions (Fe3+).\n   - This is a oxidation process, not a reduction, because the iron ions are losing electrons.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n- **Option A**: 1 only because copper(II) ions are reduced.\n  - This is correct because only the first reaction involves copper ions gaining electrons, which is a reduction.\n\n- **Option B**: 3 only because the iron is reduced.\n  - This is incorrect because the third reaction is oxidation, not reduction.\n\n- **Option C**: 1 and 2 because they both reduce copper ions.\n  - This is correct because both reactions involve copper ions gaining electrons, which is a reduction.\n\n- **Option D**: 1 and 3 because they do not have insoluble ions.\n  - This is incorrect because the third reaction is oxidation, not reduction.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **C. 1 and 2 because they both reduce copper ions**.",
