            "content": "To understand how mutations can lead to a new phenotype, we need to consider the process of gene expression. Gene expression involves several steps: transcription, translation, and post-translational modifications.\n\n1. **Transcription**: This is the first step where the DNA sequence is transcribed into messenger RNA (mRNA). The sequence of the mRNA is complementary to the DNA template strand.\n\n2. **Translation**: The mRNA is then translated into a polypeptide, which is a chain of amino acids. The sequence of the mRNA determines the sequence of amino acids in the polypeptide.\n\n3. **Post-translational Modifications**: These can include folding, cleavage, and addition of chemical groups. These modifications can affect the final structure and function of the protein.\n\n4. **Phenotype**: The phenotype is the observable characteristic of an organism, which is determined by the protein's structure and function.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **A different polypeptide is produced**: This is the correct answer. A mutation can alter the sequence of the mRNA, leading to a different amino acid sequence in the polypeptide. This change in the protein can affect its structure and function, potentially resulting in a new phenotype.\n\nB. **The polarity of tRNA becomes the opposite of that of DNA**: This option is incorrect. The polarity of tRNA is determined by its structure and is not directly related to the polarity of DNA.\n\nC. **Nucleic acids are methylated**: Methylation is a post-translational modification that can affect gene expression but does not directly change the sequence of the mRNA or the resulting protein.\n\nD. **The gene is now read in the 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 direction**: This option is incorrect. The direction of reading is determined by the orientation of the mRNA and is not a mutation-related change.\n\nTherefore, the best explanation for how mutations can result in a new phenotype is that a different polypeptide is produced due to changes in the mRNA sequence.",
