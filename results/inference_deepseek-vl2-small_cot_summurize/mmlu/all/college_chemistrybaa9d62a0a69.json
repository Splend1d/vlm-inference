            "content": "To determine the number of lines in the EPR spectrum of a rigid nitronyl nitroxide diradical, we need to consider the coupling between the unpaired electron and the two equivalent nitrogen nuclei.\n\n1. **Understanding the Structure**: A nitronyl nitroxide diradical consists of a central carbon atom bonded to two nitroxide groups. Each nitroxide group contains a nitronyl group, which is a radical with an unpaired electron.\n\n2. **Coupling and Splitting**: The unpaired electron in the nitronyl group is coupled to two equivalent nitrogen nuclei. This coupling results in a splitting of the EPR signal into multiple lines.\n\n3. **Calculating the Number of Lines**: The number of lines in the EPR spectrum is given by the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of lines} = 2J + 1\n   \\]\n   where \\( J \\) is the coupling constant.\n\n4. **Given Condition**: The problem states that \\( J \\gg a \\), where \\( a \\) is the splitting constant. This implies that the coupling constant \\( J \\) is much larger than the splitting constant \\( a \\).\n\n5. **Application of the Formula**: Substituting \\( J \\gg a \\) into the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of lines} = 2J + 1\n   \\]\n   Since \\( J \\gg a \\), the term \\( 2J \\) dominates, and the number of lines approaches \\( 2J \\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Given that \\( J \\gg a \\), the number of lines in the EPR spectrum is approximately \\( 2J \\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 9 lines\n\nThis is because the number of lines is approximately \\( 2J \\), and with \\( J \\gg a \\), the number of lines is close to 9.",
