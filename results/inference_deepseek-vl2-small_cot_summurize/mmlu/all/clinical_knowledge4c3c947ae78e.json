            "content": "To determine which statement is true about Graves Disease, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. It is a cause of ophthalmoplegia: Ophthalmoplegia refers to paralysis or weakness of the eye muscles, which can lead to double vision or other eye movement problems. Graves Disease is known to cause ophthalmoplegia due to its autoimmune nature, where antibodies attack the muscles of the eye. This makes option A correct.\n\nB. It causes a large multi-nodular goitre: While Graves Disease does cause an enlargement of the thyroid gland, known as a goiter, it typically results in a diffuse, rather than a large, multi-nodular goiter. The goiter is usually more uniform in appearance. Therefore, option B is incorrect.\n\nC. It is commoner in males than females: Graves Disease is more common in females than males. This is a well-established fact in the medical literature. Thus, option C is incorrect.\n\nD. In the past, Grave's disease sometimes caused 'Derbyshire Neck': 'Derbyshire Neck' is a term used to describe a condition where the neck becomes swollen due to the accumulation of fluid in the tissues. This condition is not specifically associated with Graves Disease. Therefore, option D is incorrect.\n\nAfter evaluating each option, the correct answer is A. It is a cause of ophthalmoplegia.",
