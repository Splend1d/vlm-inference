            "content": "To determine which option completes the statement \"The right atrioventricular valve\u2026\", let's analyze each option:\n\nA. \"is a semilunar valve\"\n- Semilunar valves are found between the heart and the major arteries. The right atrioventricular valve, also known as the tricuspid valve, is not a semilunar valve. It is located between the right atrium and the right ventricle. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\nB. \"is prevented from everting by papillary muscles\"\n- Papillary muscles are small muscles attached to the valve leaflets. They contract during ventricular contraction, pulling on chordae tendineae, which are tendinous cords that anchor the valve leaflets to the papillary muscles. This action prevents the valve leaflets from inverting or prolapsing into the atrium during ventricular relaxation. This option accurately completes the statement.\n\nC. \"is open during systole\"\n- During systole, the ventricles contract, and the right atrioventricular valve closes to prevent backflow of blood into the atrium. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\nD. \"prevents blood returning from the pulmonary trunk as the heart relaxes\"\n- The right atrioventricular valve does not prevent blood from returning from the pulmonary trunk. The pulmonary valve is the valve that prevents blood from returning to the right ventricle from the pulmonary trunk. This option is incorrect.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the correct answer is:\n\nB. is prevented from everting by papillary muscles.",
