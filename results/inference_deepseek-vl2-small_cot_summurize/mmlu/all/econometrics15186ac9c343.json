            "content": "Let's analyze each statement:\n\n(i) Adjusted R-squared is an information criterion.\nAdjusted R-squared is not an information criterion. It is a measure of the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables, adjusted for the number of predictors in the model. Information criteria, such as AIC and BIC, are used to compare models and select the one that best balances goodness of fit and model complexity.\n\n(ii) If the residual sum of squares falls when an additional term is added, the value of the information criterion will fall.\nThis statement is true. The residual sum of squares (RSS) is a measure of the total deviation of the observed values from the predicted values. If adding an additional term to the model reduces the RSS, it indicates that the model is better at explaining the data, which is reflected in a lower value of the information criterion.\n\n(iii) Akaike's information criterion always leads to model orders that are at least as large as those of Schwarz's information criterion.\nThis statement is false. Akaike's information criterion (AIC) and Schwarz's information criterion (BIC) are both used to select the best model from a set of candidate models. However, AIC tends to favor models with fewer parameters, while BIC tends to favor models with more parameters. Therefore, the model order selected by AIC is not always at least as large as that selected by BIC.\n\n(iv) Akaike's information criterion is consistent.\nThis statement is true. Consistency in information criteria means that as the sample size increases, the value of the information criterion converges to the true value of the model. Akaike's information criterion is consistent, meaning that as the sample size increases, the value of AIC converges to the true value of the model.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nA.
