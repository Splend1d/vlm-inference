Ferguson (1896) was a legal doctrine that allowed racial segregation in public facilities as long as the facilities were equal. This doctrine was challenged by the landmark Supreme Court case Brown v. Board of Education (1954), which declared that racial segregation in public schools was unconstitutional.\n\nThe Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, ratified in 1868, guarantees equal protection under the law to all citizens. It states that no state shall \"deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\" The \"separate but equal\" doctrine was a direct violation of this amendment, as it allowed for unequal treatment based on race.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Fourteenth Amendment",
