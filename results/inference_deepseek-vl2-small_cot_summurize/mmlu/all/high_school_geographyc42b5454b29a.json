            "content": "To determine the primary reason the Green Revolution did not significantly benefit Africa, we need to consider the historical context and the specific challenges faced by African agriculture during that period.\n\nThe Green Revolution, which began in the 1960s, was characterized by the introduction of high-yield crop varieties, synthetic fertilizers, and improved irrigation techniques. These innovations were designed to increase food production in developing countries, particularly in Asia. However, Africa faced several unique challenges that hindered the widespread adoption and benefits of these technologies.\n\nA. It targeted crops Africans don't grow and eat.\n- This option is incorrect. The Green Revolution did not specifically target crops that Africans do not grow or eat. Instead, it focused on staple crops like wheat, rice, and maize, which are important in many African diets.\n\nB. It required sophisticated machinery.\n- This option is incorrect. While the Green Revolution did require some machinery, it was not the primary barrier. Many African countries had access to the necessary machinery, but the issue was more about the lack of infrastructure and resources to support its use effectively.\n\nC. Population growth has fallen so drastically that Africans don't need the increased food production.\n- This option is correct. During the Green Revolution, population growth in Africa was high, and the need for increased food production was significant. However, the population growth rate began to decline in the 1970s and 1980s, which reduced the urgency for increased food production. This demographic shift meant that the immediate need for the Green Revolution's benefits diminished.\n\nD. African agricultural production went up without its help.\n- This option is incorrect. While some African countries did experience increases in agricultural production, the Green Revolution was not the sole factor. Other factors, such as changes in agricultural policies and practices, also played a role.\n\nIn conclusion, the primary reason the Green Revolution did not help Africa much was due to the significant decline in population growth, which reduced the immediate need for increased food production. Therefore, the correct answer is C.",
