This means that 1 is a generator for Z_7.\n\nB. 2: If we raise 2 to any power, we get 4 (2^2 = 4). This means that 2 is not a generator for Z_7.\n\nC. 3: If we raise 3 to any power, we get 2 (3^2 = 9 \u2261 2 mod 7). This means that 3 is not a generator for Z_7.\n\nD. 4: If we raise 4 to any power, we get 3 (4^2 = 16 \u2261 2 mod 7). This means that 4 is not a generator for Z_7.\n\nSo, the correct answer is A. 1.",
