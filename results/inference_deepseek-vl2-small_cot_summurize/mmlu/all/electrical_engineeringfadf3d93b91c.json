This means that the system does not adjust its output based on the actual output or the difference between the desired and actual output.\n\nA. Inaccurate: This is a disadvantage of an open loop control system. Since the output is determined by a fixed relationship to the input, any changes in the input will result in a fixed output, which may not be accurate or precise.\n\nB. Unreliable: This is also a disadvantage of an open loop control system. Since the output is determined by a fixed relationship to the input, any changes in the input will result in a fixed output, which may not be reliable or consistent.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. both A and B.",
