It is not involved in returning blood to the heart.\n\nB. **Carotid arteries**: These arteries supply oxygenated blood to the brain. They are not involved in returning blood to the heart.\n\nC. **Inferior vena cava**: This large vein carries deoxygenated blood from the lower half of the body back to the heart. It is not involved in carrying oxygenated blood.\n\nD. **Pulmonary veins**: These veins carry oxygenated blood from the lungs to the left atrium of the heart. They are the only veins that carry oxygenated blood back to the heart.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Pulmonary veins\n\nThe pulmonary veins are responsible for transporting oxygen-rich blood from the lungs to the heart, where it is then pumped out to the rest of the body.",
