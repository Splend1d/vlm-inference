The degree of a polynomial \\( f(x) \\) in \\( R[x] \\) is defined as the highest power of \\( x \\) in \\( f(x) \\).\n\nConsider the polynomial \\( f(x) = x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x + 1 \\) and \\( g(x) = x^2 + x + 1 \\).\n\n- The degree of \\( f(x) \\) is 3.\n- The degree of \\( g(x) \\) is 2.\n\nNow, let's compute \\( f(x) + g(x) \\):\n\\[\nf(x) + g(x) = (x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x + 1) + (x^2 + x + 1) = x^3 + 3x^2 + 4x + 2\n\\]\n\nThe degree of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) is 3, which is the same as the degree of \\( f(x) \\). Therefore, the statement is true.\n\n**Statement 2:** If \\( F \\) is a field, then every ideal of \\( F[x] \\) is principal.\n\nTo determine the truth of this statement, we need to understand the structure of ideals in a polynomial ring over a field.\n\nConsider the polynomial ring \\( F[x] \\) over a field \\( F \\). An ideal \\( I \\) in \\( F[x] \\) is a subset of \\( F[x] \\) that is closed under addition and multiplication by elements of \\( F \\).\n\nA principal ideal is an ideal that can be generated by a single element. In the polynomial ring \\( F[x] \\), every ideal is a principal ideal if and only if it is generated by a single element.\n\nHowever, not all ideals in \\( F[x] \\) are generated by a single element. For example, the ideal generated by \\( x^2 + 1 \\) is not principal because it cannot be generated by a single element.\n\nTherefore, the statement is false.\n\nGiven the analysis:\n- Statement 1 is true.\n- Statement 2 is false.\n\nThe correct answer is \\( \\boxed{C} \\).",
