            "content": "To determine which structure closes and seals off the lower airway during swallowing, we need to understand the anatomy and function of each option:\n\nA. **Alveoli**: These are tiny air sacs in the lungs where gas exchange occurs. They are not involved in sealing the airway during swallowing.\n\nB. **Epiglottis**: This is a flap-like structure located at the top of the larynx. Its primary function is to cover the glottis (the opening of the larynx) during swallowing to prevent food and liquid from entering the trachea (windpipe). This action is crucial for preventing choking and ensuring that food travels down the esophagus instead of the airway.\n\nC. **Larynx**: Also known as the voice box, the larynx is a part of the respiratory system that houses the vocal cords and is involved in breathing, producing sound, and protecting the trachea against food aspiration. It is not primarily responsible for sealing the airway during swallowing.\n\nD. **Uvula**: This is a small, fleshy extension of the soft palate that hangs down into the throat. It does not play a role in sealing the airway during swallowing.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Epiglottis\n\nThe epiglottis is the structure that closes and seals off the lower airway during swallowing, preventing food and liquid from entering the trachea.",
