            "content": "To determine which option correctly describes a difference between animal and plant cells, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **A cell wall made of cellulose**: This is a characteristic of plant cells. Cellulose is a structural component that provides rigidity and support to plant cells. Animal cells do not have a cell wall made of cellulose.\n\nB. **Lysosomes**: Both animal and plant cells contain lysosomes, which are organelles that contain enzymes for breaking down waste materials and cellular debris. Therefore, lysosomes are not a distinguishing feature between animal and plant cells.\n\nC. **Large vacuoles that store water**: While plant cells often have large central vacuoles that store water and maintain turgor pressure, animal cells also have vacuoles, but they are generally smaller and not as prominent. This is not a defining characteristic of animal cells.\n\nD. **Centrioles within centrosomes**: Centrioles are cylindrical structures that play a crucial role in cell division. They are found in animal cells but are absent in plant cells. Centrosomes are organelles that contain centrioles and are involved in organizing microtubules during cell division. This feature is unique to animal cells.\n\nAfter evaluating each option, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Centrioles within centrosomes.",
