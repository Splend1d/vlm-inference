            "content": "To find all cosets of the subgroup 4Z of 2Z, we need to understand the structure of the group 2Z and the subgroup 4Z.\n\n1. **Structure of 2Z**: The group 2Z consists of all even integers, i.e., 0, 2, 4, 6, ...\n\n2. **Structure of 4Z**: The subgroup 4Z consists of all multiples of 4, i.e., 0, 4, 8, 12, ...\n\n3. **Cosets**: A coset of a subgroup H in a group G is a set of the form gH, where g is an element of G and H is the subgroup. In other words, a coset is a set of the form {gH | g \u2208 G}.\n\n4. **Finding cosets of 4Z in 2Z**:\n   - The identity element of 2Z is 0, which is in 4Z. So, 0 is in every coset of 4Z in 2Z.\n   - Any element of 2Z can be written as 2k, where k is an integer.\n   - Multiplying both sides by 4, we get 8k, which is also in 4Z. So, 2k is in every coset of 4Z in 2Z.\n   - Therefore, every element of 2Z can be written as 8k, where k is an integer. This means that every element of 2Z is in every coset of 4Z in 2Z.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since every element of 2Z is in every coset of 4Z in 2Z, the cosets of 4Z in 2Z are exactly 2Z.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 2Z",
