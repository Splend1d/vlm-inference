            "content": "The postcondition of the `nextIntInRange` method is that it should return a random integer in the range `low` to `high`, inclusive. This means that the returned value should be greater than or equal to `low` and less than or equal to `high`.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. `(int) (Math.random() * high) + low;`\n   - This expression generates a random number between 0 and `high` (inclusive) and then adds `low` to it.\n   - The result will always be greater than or equal to `low` and less than or equal to `high`.\n   - This satisfies the postcondition.\n\nB. `(int) (Math.random() * (high - low)) + low;`\n   - This expression generates a random number between 0 and `high - low` (exclusive) and then adds `low` to it.\n   - The result will always be greater than or equal to `low` and less than or equal to `high - 1`.\n   - This does not satisfy the postcondition.\n\nC. `(int) (Math.random() * (high - low + 1)) + low;`\n   - This expression generates a random number between 0 and `high - low` (inclusive) and then adds `low` to it.\n   - The result will always be greater than or equal to `low` and less than or equal to `high`.\n   - This satisfies the postcondition.\n\nD. `(int) (Math.random() * (high + low)) + low;`\n   - This expression generates a random number between `low` and `high + low` (inclusive) and then adds `low` to it.\n   - The result will always be greater than or equal to `low` and less than or equal to `2 * high`.\n   - This does not satisfy the postcondition.\n\nTherefore, the correct options are A and C. However, since the question asks for the expression that will always return a value that satisfies the postcondition, the most straightforward and correct answer is:\n\nA. `(int) (Math.random() * high) + low;`",
