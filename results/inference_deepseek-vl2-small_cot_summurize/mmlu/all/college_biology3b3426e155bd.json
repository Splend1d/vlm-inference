Gymnosperms, such as conifers, rely on wind to disperse their pollen.\n\nB. A dominant sporophyte life cycle: This is a characteristic of all land plants, including both angiosperms and gymnosperms. Both groups have a dominant sporophyte stage in their life cycle.\n\nC. Alteration of generations: This is a characteristic of all land plants, not just angiosperms. Both angiosperms and gymnosperms undergo an alternation of generations, which includes both a haploid gametophyte and a diploid sporophyte stage.\n\nD. Double fertilization: This is a unique characteristic of angiosperms. During double fertilization, one sperm cell fertilizes the egg cell, while the other sperm cell fuses with two polar nuclei to form the triploid endosperm, which provides nutrients to the developing embryo. This process is not found in gymnosperms.\n\nBased on this analysis, the characteristic unique to angiosperms is:\n\nD. Double fertilization.",
