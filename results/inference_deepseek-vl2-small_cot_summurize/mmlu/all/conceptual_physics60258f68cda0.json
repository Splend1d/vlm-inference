All of these.\n\nThe speed of sound in air is influenced by several factors, including:\n\n1. **Frequency**: Higher frequencies result in higher sound speeds because the molecules are closer together and can vibrate more rapidly.\n\n2. **Wavelength**: The wavelength of the sound wave affects the speed of sound. Longer wavelengths (lower frequencies) travel faster than shorter wavelengths (higher frequencies).\n\n3. **Air Temperature**: The speed of sound in air increases with temperature. This is because warmer air molecules move faster, allowing them to transmit sound waves more quickly.\n\nThese factors combined determine the speed of sound in air.",
