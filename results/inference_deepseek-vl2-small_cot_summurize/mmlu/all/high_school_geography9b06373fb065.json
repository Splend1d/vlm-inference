A map scale is a ratio that compares the distance on the map to the actual distance on the ground. A smaller map scale means that the map represents a smaller area in more detail.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. The world: A map of the world would cover a vast area, including continents, countries, and oceans. It would be very detailed but would cover a large area, which means it would have a larger map scale.\n\nB. Atlanta, Georgia: A map of Atlanta, Georgia, would cover a smaller area than a map of the world. It would be more detailed and would have a smaller map scale.\n\nC. Main Street, Small Town, Ohio: A map of Main Street in a small town in Ohio would cover an even smaller area than a map of Atlanta, Georgia. It would be more detailed and would have a smaller map scale.\n\nD. Pennsylvania: A map of Pennsylvania would cover a larger area than a map of Atlanta, Georgia or a map of Main Street in a small town in Ohio. It would be less detailed and would have a larger map scale.\n\nBased on this analysis, the map of Main Street, Small Town, Ohio (Option C) would have the smallest map scale because it covers the smallest area and is the most detailed.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Main Street, Small Town, Ohio.",
