Titan, the largest moon of Saturn, has a thick atmosphere composed mainly of nitrogen and methane. It is the only moon in the outer solar system with a substantial atmosphere.\n\nB. Titan is the only outer solar system moon with evidence for recent geologic activity.\n- This statement is also true. Titan has features that suggest recent geologic activity, such as the presence of methane lakes and rivers, which are thought to be relatively young.\n\nC. Titan's atmosphere is composed mostly of hydrocarbons.\n- This statement is true. Titan's atmosphere is primarily composed of nitrogen and methane, which are both hydrocarbons.\n\nD. A and D.\n- This statement is true because both statements A and D are correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. A and D.",
