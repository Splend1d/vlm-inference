If num1 is less than or equal to num2 and num1 is less than or equal to num3, then the condition num1 > num2 || num1 > num3 will be false, and the loop will not execute.\n\nOption A is not sufficient because it only checks if num1 is less than num2, but it does not check if num1 is less than num3.\n\nOption B is not sufficient because it only checks if num1 is less than num3, but it does not check if num1 is greater than num2.\n\nOption D is not sufficient because it only checks if num1 is less than num2 and num1 is less than num3, but it does not check if num1 is greater than num2 and num1 is greater than num3.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. num1 > num2 && num1 > num3.",
