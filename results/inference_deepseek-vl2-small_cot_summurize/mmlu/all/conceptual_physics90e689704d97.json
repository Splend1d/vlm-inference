This is because electrons exhibit wave-like behavior, particularly in the context of quantum mechanics. The wave-like nature of electrons is described by the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, which is a fundamental equation in quantum mechanics.\n\nIn the Bohr model of the atom, electrons are thought to orbit the nucleus in fixed, circular paths, similar to planets orbiting the sun. However, this model is not entirely accurate, as it does not take into account the wave-like behavior of electrons.\n\nThe wave-like behavior of electrons is most accurately described by the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, which is a partial differential equation that describes the quantum state of a physical system. The solutions to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation are called wave functions, which describe the probability of finding an electron at a given point in space.\n\nThe wave functions of electrons in atoms are often represented as standing waves, which are solutions to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation that describe the probability of finding an electron at a given point in space. These standing waves are discrete, meaning that they have specific frequencies and amplitudes, and they are localized around the nucleus of the atom.\n\nIn summary, the discrete orbits of electrons are best understood when modeled by waves, specifically the wave functions of electrons in atoms.",
