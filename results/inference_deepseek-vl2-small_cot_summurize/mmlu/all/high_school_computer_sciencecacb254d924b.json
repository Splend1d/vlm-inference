The goal of the attack: Both DDoS and DoS attacks aim to overwhelm a network or server with traffic, causing it to become unavailable to legitimate users. The primary goal is to disrupt service, not to achieve a specific objective beyond that.\n\nB. The number of computers being attacked: In a DDoS attack, multiple computers (often referred to as bots or zombies) are compromised and used to send traffic to the target. In contrast, a DoS attack typically involves a single computer or a small group of computers. Thus, the number of computers being attacked is a key distinguishing factor.\n\nC. The number of computers launching the attack: This option is not relevant to the distinction between DDoS and DoS attacks. The number of computers launching the attack is not a defining characteristic of either type of attack.\n\nD. The time period in which the attack occurs: Both DDoS and DoS attacks can occur at any time, and the duration of the attack is not a distinguishing feature.\n\nAfter evaluating each option, the primary difference between a DDoS attack and a DoS attack is the number of computers being attacked. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. The number of computers being attacked.",
