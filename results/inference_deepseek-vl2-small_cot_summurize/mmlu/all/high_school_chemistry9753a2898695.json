            "content": "To determine the vapor pressure of a mixture of solvents A and B, we can use Raoult's Law. Raoult's Law states that the vapor pressure of a solution is equal to the sum of the vapor pressures of the individual components multiplied by their mole fractions.\n\nGiven:\n- Vapor pressure of solvent A (PA) = 345 torr\n- Vapor pressure of solvent B (PB) = 213 torr\n- Mole fraction of A (XA) = 0.285\n\nUsing Raoult's Law, the vapor pressure of the mixture (PM) is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[ PM = XA \\times PA + XB \\times PB \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( XA \\) is the mole fraction of solvent A.\n- \\( PB \\) is the vapor pressure of solvent B.\n\nSubstitute the given values into the equation:\n\n\\[ PM = 0.285 \\times 345 + 0.715 \\times 213 \\]\n\nCalculate each term:\n\n1. \\( 0.285 \\times 345 = 98.275 \\)\n2. \\( 0.715 \\times 213 = 152.295 \\)\n\nAdd these values to find the total vapor pressure of the mixture:\n\n\\[ PM = 98.275 + 152.295 = 250.570 \\, \\text{torr} \\]\n\nThus, the vapor pressure of the mixture is approximately 251 torr.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 251 torr",
