            "content": "To determine which isomer of C6H14 has lines with five distinct chemical shifts in its 13C NMR spectrum, we need to analyze the structure of each option.\n\nA. **Hexane**: Hexane is a straight-chain alkane with the formula C6H14. Its structure is CH3-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. In 13C NMR, each carbon in a straight-chain alkane typically shows one peak, corresponding to the unique environments of the carbon atoms. Therefore, hexane would have one peak, not five.\n\nB. **2-methylpentane**: This isomer has the structure CH3-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3. The methyl group (CH3) attached to the second carbon creates a unique environment, resulting in one peak. The other carbons in the chain are in similar environments, leading to one peak as well.\n\nC. **3-methylpentane**: The structure is CH3-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. The methyl group attached to the third carbon creates a unique environment, resulting in one peak. The other carbons in the chain are in similar environments, leading to one peak as well.\n\nD. **2,3-dimethylbutane**: This isomer has the structure CH3-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. The two methyl groups create two unique environments, resulting in two peaks. The remaining carbons are in similar environments, leading to one peak each.\n\nUpon analyzing the structures, we find that 2,3-dimethylbutane is the only isomer with two distinct environments due to the two methyl groups, resulting in two peaks.\n\nTherefore, the isomer of C6H14 that has lines with five distinct chemical shifts is **D. 2,3-dimethylbutane**.",
