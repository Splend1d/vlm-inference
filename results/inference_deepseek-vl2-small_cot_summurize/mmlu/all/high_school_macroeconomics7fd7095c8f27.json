            "content": "The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is a key component of the Federal Reserve System, which is the central banking system of the United States. The FOMC is responsible for setting monetary policy, which includes decisions on interest rates and the buying and selling of government securities.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Advises the President of the United States.**\n   - This statement is incorrect. The Federal Reserve System is an independent agency of the U.S. government, and the FOMC does not directly advise the President. Instead, the Federal Reserve provides independent oversight and policy recommendations to the President and Congress.\n\nB. **Is part of the Federal Reserve System.**\n   - This statement is correct. The FOMC is a committee within the Federal Reserve System, which is the central bank of the United States. The Federal Reserve System is composed of the Federal Reserve Board, 12 Federal Reserve Banks, and the FOMC.\n\nC. **Has seven members.**\n   - This statement is incorrect. The FOMC currently has 12 members, including the seven members of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and four other Federal Reserve Bank presidents who serve on a rotating basis.\n\nD. **Promotes free trade.**\n   - This statement is incorrect. The primary role of the Federal Reserve, including the FOMC, is to manage monetary policy and maintain financial stability, not to promote free trade. Free trade is typically a function of international economic policies and agreements.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. is part of the Federal Reserve System.**",
