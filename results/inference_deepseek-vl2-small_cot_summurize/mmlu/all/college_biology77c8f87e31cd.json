            "content": "To determine the correct answer, we need to understand the role of cytochalasin B in the process of nerve outgrowth and the structure of the growth cone.\n\n1. **Understanding the Growth Cone**: The growth cone is a dynamic structure at the tip of the axon that plays a crucial role in guiding the axon's growth. It is composed of microtubules, microfilaments, and other proteins.\n\n2. **Role of Cytochalasin B**: Cytochalasin B is a drug that inhibits the polymerization of actin filaments. In the context of the growth cone, this means it affects the microfilaments, which are part of the cytoskeleton.\n\n3. **Effect on Microtubules**: Microtubules are not affected by cytochalasin B because they are composed of tubulin and are not polymerized actin filaments. Therefore, microtubules do not undergo any change in their structure or function when exposed to cytochalasin B.\n\n4. **Effect on Microspikes**: Microspikes are extensions of the growth cone that extend and retract to help the growth cone move forward. These microspikes are composed of microfilaments.\n\n5. **Cytochalasin B's Impact on Microspikes**: When cytochalasin B is applied, it causes the microfilaments in the microspikes to undergo irreversible depolymerization. This means that the microspikes cannot retract properly, hindering the growth cone's ability to move forward.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nD. microfilaments in the microspike to undergo irreversible depolymerization.",
