            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of relative motion and the time dilation effect.\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**:\n   - Observer O is at rest between two light sources at x = 0 and x = 10 m.\n   - Both sources flash simultaneously for O.\n   - Observer O' is moving at a constant speed parallel to the x-axis.\n   - One source flashes 13 ns before the other for O'.\n\n2. **Time Dilation**:\n   - Time dilation is a relativistic effect where time appears to pass slower for an observer in motion relative to a stationary observer.\n   - The time dilation factor is given by the Lorentz factor, \\(\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\\), where \\(v\\) is the relative velocity and \\(c\\) is the speed of light.\n\n3. **Calculating the Time Difference**:\n   - Let \\(t_0\\) be the time it takes for light to travel from the source at x = 0 to O.\n   - Let \\(t_1\\) be the time it takes for light to travel from the source at x = 10 m to O.\n   - For O, both times are equal, \\(t_0 = t_1\\).\n   - For O', one source flashes 13 ns before the other, so \\(t_1 - t_0 = 13\\) ns.\n\n4. **Relating Time and Distance**:\n   - The speed of light is constant, so the distance traveled by light is directly proportional to the time it takes.\n   - Therefore, \\(t_0 = \\frac{d}{c}\\) and \\(t_1 = \\frac{d}{c} + \\frac{13}{c}\\).\n\n5. **Using Time Dilation**:\n   - For O', the time dilation factor is \\(\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\\).\n   - Substituting the time difference, we get:\n     \\[\n     \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{13^2}{c^2}}}\n     \\]\n   - Solving for \\(v\\), we get:\n     \\[\n     \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{169}{c^2}}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\frac{c^2 - 169}{c^2}}} = \\frac{c}{\\sqrt{c^2 - 169}}\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying, we find:\n     \\[\n     \\gamma = \\frac{c}{\\sqrt{c^2 - 169}} = \\frac{c}{\\sqrt{c^2 - 169}} \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{c^2 - 169}}{\\sqrt{c^2 - 169}} = \\frac{c\\sqrt{c^2 - 169}}{c^2 - 169}\n     \\]\n\n6. **Calculating the Speed**:\n   - The speed \\(v\\) is given by \\(v = \\frac{c}{\\gamma}\\).\n   - Substituting \\(\\gamma\\), we get:\n     \\[\n     v = \\frac{c}{\\frac{c\\sqrt{c^2 - 169}}{c^2 - 169}} = \\frac{c^2 - 169}{c\\sqrt{c^2 - 169}}\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying, we find:\n     \\[\n     v = \\frac{c^2 - 169}{c\\sqrt{c^2 - 169}} = \\frac{c^2 - 169}{c\\sqrt{c^2 - 169}} \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{c^2 - 169}}{\\sqrt{c^2 - 169}} = \\frac{c^2 - 169}{c(c^2 - 169)} = \\frac{c^2 - 169}{c^3 - 169c}\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying further, we find:\n     \\[\n     v = \\frac{c^2 - 169}{c^3 - 169c} = \\frac{c^2 - 169}{c(c^2 - 169)} = \\frac{c^2 - 169}{c^3 - 16",
