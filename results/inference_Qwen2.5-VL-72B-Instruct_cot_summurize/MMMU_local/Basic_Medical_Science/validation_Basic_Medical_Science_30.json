The middle cerebral arteries are prominently displayed in red, branching out to supply different regions of the cerebral hemispheres.\n\nIn the majority of people, the areas involved in speech (such as Broca's area and Wernicke's area) are located in the left hemisphere of the brain. Therefore, the vessel that primarily serves these areas is the left middle cerebral artery.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Left middle cerebral artery."
