However, the image alone does not provide enough specific information to definitively determine if it is depicting lower motor neurons or their axons terminating on skeletal muscle fibers.\n\nLower motor neurons (LMNs) are indeed the neurons whose axons directly innervate skeletal muscle fibers. They are responsible for transmitting signals from the central nervous system to the muscles, leading to muscle contraction. The statement in question is a general fact about lower motor neurons and is not dependent on the specific image provided.\n\nTherefore, based on the general knowledge about lower motor neurons:\n\nA. true"
