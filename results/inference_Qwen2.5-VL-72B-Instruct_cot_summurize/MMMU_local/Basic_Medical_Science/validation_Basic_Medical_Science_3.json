Prokaryotic cells do not have a true nucleus; their genetic material is not enclosed within a nuclear membrane.\n\nGiven these observations:\n\n- Option A is incorrect because the cell does have a nucleus.\n- Option B is correct because the cell has both a cell wall and a nucleus, which are characteristics of eukaryotic cells.\n- Option C is incorrect because the cell does have a nucleus.\n- Option D is incorrect because having a cell wall alone does not make a cell prokaryotic; the absence of a nucleus is the key distinguishing factor.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. It is a eukaryotic cell because it has a cell wall and a nucleus**."
