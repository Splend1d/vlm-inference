Patients show motor abnormalities, personality changes, a gradual loss of higher brain functions, and eventually die. Below <image 1> is a family pedigree and an accompanying Southern blot that was obtained with genomic DNA that was probed with a DNA complementary to the gene for the Huntingtin protein. Based on the linked image above, which statement is most likely to be CORRECT?\n\nA. HD is an autosomal recessive disease\nB. The huntingtin gene is likely to be located on the X-chromosome\nC. A likely cause of HD is an unstable triplet repeat in the HD gene\nD. The pattern of bands in the blot is indicative of abnormal splicing of the HD mRNA\nE. In most individuals, the region of the HD gene detected by the DNA probe is distributed on six different restriction fragments\n"

                    "text": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the given information step by step:\n\n1. **Family Pedigree Analysis:**\n   - The pedigree shows that the disease is passed from one generation to another.\n   - Both males and females are affected, suggesting it is not sex-linked (i.e., not on the X-chromosome).\n   - The presence of the disease in multiple generations suggests it is likely dominant.\n\n2. **Southern Blot Analysis:**\n   - The Southern blot shows multiple bands, indicating variability in the size of the DNA fragments.\n   - The presence of additional bands in affected individuals compared to unaffected ones suggests an expansion or alteration in the DNA sequence.\n\nGiven these points, let's evaluate each option:\n\n**A. HD is an autosomal recessive disease**\n- This is unlikely because the pedigree shows a dominant pattern of inheritance where affected individuals have at least one affected parent.\n\n**B. The huntingtin gene is likely to be located on the X-chromosome**\n- This is unlikely because both males and females are equally affected, indicating it is not sex-linked.\n\n**C. A likely cause of HD is an unstable triplet repeat in the HD gene**\n- This is plausible. Huntington's disease is known to be caused by an expansion of CAG repeats in the huntingtin gene, leading to an unstable triplet repeat. The Southern blot showing variable band sizes supports this idea as it indicates differences in the length of the repeated sequences.\n\n**D. The pattern of bands in the blot is indicative of abnormal splicing of the HD mRNA**\n- This is less likely. The Southern blot detects DNA, not RNA, so it does not provide information about mRNA splicing.\n\n**E. In most individuals, the region of the HD gene detected by the DNA probe is distributed on six different restriction fragments**\n- While the blot shows multiple bands, it does not necessarily mean there are six distinct restriction fragments. The bands could represent variations in repeat lengths rather than distinct fragments.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most likely correct statement is:\n\n**C. A likely cause of HD is an unstable triplet repeat in the HD gene**"
