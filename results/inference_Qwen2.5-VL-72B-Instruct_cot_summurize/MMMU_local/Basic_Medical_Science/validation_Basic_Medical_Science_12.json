However, based on the question, we can discuss the correct pathway.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n**A. Dorsal column.**\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Dorsal Column:** The dorsal column-medial lemniscus pathway is responsible for transmitting fine touch, vibration, and proprioceptive sensations from the skin, including the nipples, to the brain. When the nipple is stimulated, sensory neurons in the skin send signals through the dorsal roots into the spinal cord. These signals then travel up the dorsal columns (specifically the gracile and cuneate tracts) to the medulla oblongata, where they synapse in the gracile and cuneate nuclei. From there, secondary neurons cross over and ascend as the medial lemniscus to the thalamus, and finally to the somatosensory cortex in the brain.\n\n- **Spinoreticular Pathways:** These pathways are involved in pain and temperature sensation and do not play a primary role in the transmission of touch and pressure from the nipple.\n\n- **Solitary Tract:** This tract is primarily involved in the transmission of visceral sensory information related to taste and some aspects of cardiovascular and respiratory control. It is not involved in somatic sensory information from the skin.\n\n- **Dentatorubrothalamic Tract:** This tract is part of the cerebellar output system and is involved in motor coordination. It does not play a role in sensory transmission from the skin.\n\nTherefore, the dorsal column is the correct pathway for the transmission of touch and pressure sensations from the nipple to the brain."
