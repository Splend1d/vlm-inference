A tract carrying releasing hormones.\n\nThis tract connects the hypothalamus to the anterior pituitary (adenohypophysis) and carries releasing hormones that regulate the secretion of hormones from the anterior pituitary. These hormones include thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), and others. The other options do not accurately describe the function of the tuberoinfundibular tract."
