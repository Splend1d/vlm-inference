                    "text": "To determine if the pedigree in Figure 1 could show the pattern for the transmission of colorblindness, we need to understand the inheritance pattern of colorblindness. Colorblindness is typically an X-linked recessive trait. This means:\n\n1. Males have only one X chromosome, so if they inherit the recessive allele (X^c), they will be colorblind.\n2. Females have two X chromosomes, so they need to inherit two recessive alleles (X^cX^c) to be colorblind. If they inherit one recessive allele and one normal allele (X^CX^c), they will be carriers but not colorblind.\n\nLet's analyze the pedigree step by step:\n\n1. **Individual 1 (Female, Carrier)**: She has one normal allele (X^C) and one recessive allele (X^c). She can pass either allele to her offspring.\n2. **Individual 2 (Male, Afflicted)**: He has the recessive allele (X^cY) and is colorblind.\n3. **Offspring Analysis**:\n   - **Individual 3 (Male, Afflicted)**: He must have inherited the recessive allele (X^c) from his mother (Individual 1) and the Y chromosome from his father (Individual 2).\n   - **Individual 4 (Female, Carrier)**: She must have inherited the recessive allele (X^c) from her father (Individual 2) and the normal allele (X^C) from her mother (Individual 1).\n   - **Individual 5 (Female, Normal)**: She must have inherited the normal allele (X^C) from her mother (Individual 1) and the normal allele (X^C) from her father (Individual 2).\n   - **Individual 6 (Male, Afflicted)**: He must have inherited the recessive allele (X^c) from his mother (Individual 1) and the Y chromosome from his father (Individual 2).\n   - **Individual 7 (Male, Normal)**: He must have inherited the normal allele (X^C) from his mother (Individual 1) and the Y chromosome from his father (Individual 2).\n   - **Individual 8 (Female, Carrier)**: She must have inherited the recessive allele (X^c) from her father (Individual 2) and the normal allele (X^C) from her mother (Individual 1).\n   - **Individual 9 (Male, Normal)**: He must have inherited the normal allele (X^C) from his mother (Individual 8) and the Y chromosome from his father (not shown).\n\nThe pedigree shows that the trait is passed down in a manner consistent with X-linked recessive inheritance. Therefore, the pedigree could indeed show the pattern for the transmission of colorblindness.\n\nThe answer is: \\boxed{A}"
