This appearance is characteristic of corpora amylacea.\n\nCorpora amylacea are spherical or ovoid structures composed of concentric layers of glycoprotein and mucopolysaccharides. They are often found in the brain and other organs and are considered to be age-related degenerative changes.\n\nGiven the options provided:\n\nA. Alzheimer's type II astrocyte - These are enlarged astrocytes with a pale, swollen nucleus and are typically seen in association with metabolic disorders affecting the liver.\nB. Bergmann gliosis - This refers to reactive gliosis involving Bergmann glia in the cerebellum, which is not depicted here.\nC. Corpora amylacea - This matches the description and appearance of the structure in the image.\nD. Eosinophilic granular body - These are typically smaller and more granular, and do not have the concentric layering seen here.\nE. Eosinophilic granular body - This is a repetition of option D and does not fit the image.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Corpora amylacea"
