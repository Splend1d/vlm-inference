The DMNV is a cranial nerve nucleus that gives rise to preganglionic parasympathetic fibers.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\nA. **Muscles of pharynx and larynx**: These muscles are primarily innervated by the motor nucleus of the glossopharyngeal nerve (IX) and the recurrent laryngeal branch of the vagus nerve (X), but not directly by the DMNV.\n\nB. **Postganglionic parasympathetic cell bodies**: The axons from the DMNV terminate at postganglionic parasympathetic cell bodies located in the walls of the organs they innervate. These postganglionic neurons then innervate the target organs.\n\nC. **Smooth muscle of viscera**: While the DMNV does ultimately influence the smooth muscle of viscera through its parasympathetic innervation, it does so indirectly via the postganglionic neurons mentioned in option B.\n\nGiven this information, the most accurate answer is:\n\n**B. Postganglionic parasympathetic cell bodies.**"
