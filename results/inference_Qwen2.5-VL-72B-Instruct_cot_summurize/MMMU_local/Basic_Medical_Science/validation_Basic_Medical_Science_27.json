The macula is located in the utricle and saccule and is responsible for detecting linear acceleration and the position of the head relative to gravity.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Signals angular acceleration.\n- This is incorrect. Angular acceleration is detected by the semicircular canals, not the macula.\n\nB. Is important for conjugate eye movements.\n- This is incorrect. Conjugate eye movements are controlled by the brainstem and related neural pathways, not directly by the macula.\n\nC. Signals orientation with respect to gravity.\n- This is correct. The macula detects the position of the head relative to gravity and linear acceleration.\n\nD. Is bathed with perilymph.\n- This is incorrect. The macula is bathed in endolymph, not perilymph.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nC. Signals orientation with respect to gravity."
