This can be determined by the presence of norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (E) as neurotransmitters, which are characteristic of adrenergic synapses. Additionally, the diagram shows the synthesis pathway for these neurotransmitters, starting from tyrosine and involving enzymes like tyrosine hydroxylase and phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT). The presence of adrenergic receptors (\u03b11, \u03b12, \u03b21, \u03b22) on the post-synaptic cell further supports this identification.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Adrenergic synapse"
