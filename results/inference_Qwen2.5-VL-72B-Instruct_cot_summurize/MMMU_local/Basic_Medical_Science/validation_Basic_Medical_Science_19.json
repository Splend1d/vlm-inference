In the context of the cerebellum, where Purkinje cells and granule cells interact, the orientation of the Purkinje cell dendrites with respect to the granule cell axons (parallel fibers) is:\n\nA. Perpendicular.\n\nPurkinje cell dendrites extend radially from the cell body, while the parallel fibers run perpendicular to these dendrites, forming synapses along their length. This perpendicular arrangement is crucial for the functional organization of the cerebellar cortex."
