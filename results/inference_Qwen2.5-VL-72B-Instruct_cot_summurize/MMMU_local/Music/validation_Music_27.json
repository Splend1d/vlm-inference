Let's analyze the melody step by step:\n\n1. The first measure contains the notes: B\u266d, A\u266d, G\u266d.\n2. The second measure contains the notes: A\u266d, G\u266d, F\u266d.\n3. The third measure contains the notes: F\u266d, E\u266d, D\u266d.\n4. The fourth measure contains the notes: D\u266d, C\u266d, B\u266d.\n5. The fifth measure contains the notes: B\u266d, A\u266d, G\u266d.\n6. The sixth measure contains the notes: G\u266d, F\u266d, E\u266d.\n7. The seventh measure contains the notes: E\u266d, D\u266d, C\u266d.\n8. The eighth measure contains the notes: C\u266d, B\u266d, A\u266d.\n\nNow, let's look for enharmonic modulations:\n- In the fourth measure, the note C\u266d is enharmonically equivalent to B\u266e.\n- In the seventh measure, the note C\u266d is enharmonically equivalent to B\u266e.\n\nSo, there are two instances of enharmonic modulation in the melody.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is \\boxed{C}."
