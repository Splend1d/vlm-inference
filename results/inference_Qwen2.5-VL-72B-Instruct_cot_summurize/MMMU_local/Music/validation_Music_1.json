We need to express this single eighth note as three dotted notes.\n\nA dotted note increases the duration of the original note by half its value. So, a dotted eighth note is equivalent to an eighth note plus a sixteenth note.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n- An eighth note is worth 1/8 of a whole note.\n- A dotted eighth note is worth 1/8 + 1/16 = 3/16 of a whole note.\n\nIf we have three dotted eighth notes, their total duration would be:\n\\[ 3 \\times \\frac{3}{16} = \\frac{9}{16} \\]\n\nNow, let's check the options:\n\nA. Three dotted eighth notes: This matches our calculation.\nB. Two dotted eighth notes and one eighth note: This would be \\( \\frac{3}{16} + \\frac{3}{16} + \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{3}{16} + \\frac{3}{16} + \\frac{2}{16} = \\frac{8}{16} = \\frac{1}{2} \\), which is not equal to \\(\\frac{9}{16}\\).\nC. One dotted eighth note and two eighth notes: This would be \\( \\frac{3}{16} + \\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{3}{16} + \\frac{2}{16} + \\frac{2}{16} = \\frac{7}{16} \\), which is not equal to \\(\\frac{9}{16}\\).\nD. Two eighth notes and one dotted eighth note: This would be \\( \\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{3}{16} = \\frac{2}{16} + \\frac{2}{16} + \\frac{3}{16} = \\frac{7}{16} \\), which is not equal to \\(\\frac{9}{16}\\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{A}\n\\]"
