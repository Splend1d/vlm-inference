III) is playing a note.\n   - The second violins (Vl. II) are also playing a note.\n\n2. **Locate the Notes on the Staff:**\n   - The third horn is in the bass clef.\n   - The second violins are in the treble clef.\n\n3. **Determine the Specific Notes:**\n   - From the sheet music, the third horn is playing a **G**.\n   - The second violins are playing a **D** above the G.\n\n4. **Calculate the Interval:**\n   - The interval between G and D is a **perfect 5th** when counting from G up to D.\n   - However, since the D is an octave higher, it becomes a **major 9th** or a **compound major 2nd**.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe correct answer is:\n\n**B. major 9th/ compound major 2nd**"
