The first measure has a quarter note (1 beat), a rest (1 beat), and another quarter note (1 beat). This adds up to 3 beats, which is incorrect for a 2/4 time signature.\n\nB. The first measure has an eighth note (1/2 beat), an eighth note (1/2 beat), a quarter note (1 beat), and a rest (1 beat). This adds up to 3 beats, which is incorrect for a 2/4 time signature.\n\nC. The first measure has a quarter note (1 beat) and another quarter note (1 beat). This adds up to 2 beats, which is correct for a 2/4 time signature.\n\nD. The first measure has an eighth note (1/2 beat), an eighth note (1/2 beat), an eighth note (1/2 beat), and an eighth note (1/2 beat). This adds up to 2 beats, which is correct for a 2/4 time signature.\n\nBoth options C and D are correct in terms of having exactly 2 beats per measure. However, since the question asks for \"the correct notation,\" and typically only one answer is expected, we should choose the simplest and most straightforward option, which is C.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is \\boxed{C}."
