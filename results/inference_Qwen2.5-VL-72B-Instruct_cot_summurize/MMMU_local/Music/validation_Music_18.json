If it were F# major, the notes would be F#, G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E#. This does not match our notes.\n\nB. **c melodic minor scale**: The c melodic minor scale has the notes: C, D, Eb, F, G, A, B. When ascending, it becomes C, D, Eb, F, G, A, B. This does not include F natural and G sharp.\n\nC. **b harmonic minor scale**: The b harmonic minor scale has the notes: Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, A. This does not include F natural and G sharp.\n\nD. **E melodic major scale**: The E melodic major scale (which is essentially the E major scale) has the notes: E, F#, G#, A, B, C#, D#. This includes both F# and G#, which matches our notes when considering enharmonic equivalents (F# is the same as Gb).\n\nGiven the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nD. E melodic major scale"
