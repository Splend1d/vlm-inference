The time signature in this score is \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\), which means each measure contains 3 quarter notes (or their equivalent).\n\nLet's break down the score bar by bar:\n\n1. The first bar contains:\n   - A dotted quarter note (which is equivalent to 1.5 quarter notes)\n   - A quarter note\n   - A quarter rest\n   Total: 1.5 + 1 + 0.5 = 3 quarter notes\n\n2. The second bar contains:\n   - A dotted quarter note (which is equivalent to 1.5 quarter notes)\n   - A quarter rest\n   - A dotted quarter note (which is equivalent to 1.5 quarter notes)\n   Total: 1.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 3 quarter notes\n\n3. The third bar contains:\n   - A half note (which is equivalent to 2 quarter notes)\n   - A quarter note\n   Total: 2 + 1 = 3 quarter notes\n\n4. The fourth bar contains:\n   - A quarter note\n   - A dotted quarter note (which is equivalent to 1.5 quarter notes)\n   - A quarter note\n   Total: 1 + 1.5 + 0.5 = 3 quarter notes\n\n5. The fifth bar contains:\n   - A half note (which is equivalent to 2 quarter notes)\n   - A quarter note\n   Total: 2 + 1 = 3 quarter notes\n\nEach of these bars contains exactly 3 quarter notes, which matches the time signature \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\). Therefore, there are 5 measures in the score.\n\nThe correct answer is \\(\\boxed{C}\\)."
