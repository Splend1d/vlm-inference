In compound time, each beat is divided into three parts. The equivalent simple time signature for 9/8 is 3/4, where each beat is divided into two parts.\n\nLet's analyze the given bar in 9/8:\n\n- The first note is a dotted quarter note (which is equivalent to three eighth notes).\n- The second note is an eighth note.\n- The third note is a quarter note (which is equivalent to two eighth notes).\n- The fourth note is a dotted quarter note (which is equivalent to three eighth notes).\n\nNow, let's rewrite this in 3/4 time:\n\n- The first note (dotted quarter note) becomes a dotted half note.\n- The second note (eighth note) becomes a quarter note.\n- The third note (quarter note) remains a quarter note.\n- The fourth note (dotted quarter note) becomes a dotted half note.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\n- Option A: This shows a different rhythm and does not match the original bar.\n- Option B: This shows the correct rhythm but in 3/4 time.\n- Option C: This shows a different rhythm and does not match the original bar.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. box 2"
