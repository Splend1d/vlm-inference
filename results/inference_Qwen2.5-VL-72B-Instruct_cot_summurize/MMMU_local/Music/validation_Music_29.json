It is not suitable for playing the high-pitched notes of the oboe part.\n\n2. **Double Bass**: The double bass is a string instrument with a very low range, typically playing in the bass register. It is also not suitable for playing the high-pitched notes of the oboe part.\n\n3. **Bassoon**: The bassoon is a woodwind instrument with a lower range, typically playing in the tenor and bass registers. While it can play higher notes, it is not as well-suited for the high-pitched notes of the oboe part as other instruments.\n\n4. **Violin**: The violin is a string instrument with a high range, similar to the oboe. It can easily play the high-pitched notes of the oboe part and is well-suited to match the pitch and range of the oboe.\n\nGiven this analysis, the best-suited instrument to play the oboe part at the same pitch is the violin.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nD. box4"
