So, there are 3 semitones.\n   - A major sixth interval would have 9 semitones, but since we are descending, we need to consider the inversion. The inversion of a major sixth is a minor third, which has 3 semitones.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The interval between G and E is a minor third.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. minor"
