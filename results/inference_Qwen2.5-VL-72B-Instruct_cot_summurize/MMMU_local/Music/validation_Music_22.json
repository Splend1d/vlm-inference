These notes are written in the order G# (bottom note), B, D, and F# (top note).\n\n3. **Determine the Root Note**: In a third inversion, the seventh of the chord is in the bass. Here, G# is the bottom note, so it is the seventh of the chord. To find the root, we need to identify the note that is a major seventh below G#. The note a major seventh below G# is A.\n\n4. **Identify the Chord Type**: \n   - The interval between A and C# is a major third.\n   - The interval between C# and E is a minor third.\n   - The interval between E and G# is a major third.\n   - The interval between A and G# is a major seventh.\n\n   Therefore, the chord is an A major seventh chord (A, C#, E, G#).\n\n5. **Determine the Inversion**: Since G# is the bottom note, it is the seventh of the chord, indicating that this is the third inversion of the A major seventh chord.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\nA. Major seventh in third inversion\n\nSo, the final answer is \\boxed{A}."
