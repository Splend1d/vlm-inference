Determine the number of semitones between them.\n3. Identify the interval based on the number of semitones.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Two Notes\n\nThe first note is an F (natural) and the second note is a D (flat).\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Number of Semitones Between Them\n\nLet's count the semitones from F to D flat:\n- F to F# (1 semitone)\n- F# to G (1 semitone)\n- G to G# (1 semitone)\n- G# to A (1 semitone)\n- A to A# (1 semitone)\n- A# to B (1 semitone)\n- B to C (1 semitone)\n- C to C# (1 semitone)\n- C# to D (1 semitone)\n- D to D flat (1 semitone)\n\nSo, there are 9 semitones between F and D flat.\n\n### Step 3: Identify the Interval Based on the Number of Semitones\n\nAn interval of 9 semitones is a minor 7th. This can be confirmed by knowing that a major 7th is 11 semitones, and a minor 7th is 10 semitones less one semitone, which is 9 semitones.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n\\boxed{B}"
