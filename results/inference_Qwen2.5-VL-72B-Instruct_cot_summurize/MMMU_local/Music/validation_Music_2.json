Starting from B\u266d, the correct sequence would be:\n\nB\u266d, B, C, C\u266f/D\u266d, D, D\u266f/E\u266d, E, F, F\u266f/G\u266d, G, G\u266f/A\u266d, A, A\u266f/B\u266d\n\nNow, let's compare this with the given sequence in the image:\n\nB\u266d, C, C\u266f/D\u266d, D, D\u266f/E\u266d, E, F, F\u266f/G\u266d, G, G\u266f/A\u266d, A, A\u266f/B\u266d\n\nWe can see that the sequence in the image is missing the note B after B\u266d. Therefore, the given sequence is not a correct chromatic scale starting on B\u266d.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\nB. False"
