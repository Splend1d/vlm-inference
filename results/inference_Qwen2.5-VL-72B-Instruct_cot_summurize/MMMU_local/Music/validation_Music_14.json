Identify the notes:\n   - The lower note is D.\n   - The upper note is F#.\n\n2. Determine the simple interval between D and F#:\n   - From D to F is a minor third.\n   - Adding the sharp to F makes it a major third (D to F#).\n\n3. Check if the interval is compound:\n   - A compound interval is an interval greater than an octave.\n   - The given interval is not greater than an octave, so it is a simple interval.\n\n4. Match the simple interval with the options:\n   - The interval D to F# is a major third.\n\nSince the interval is a simple major third and not a compound interval, none of the given options (which are all compound intervals) correctly describe the interval.\n\nHowever, if we were to choose the closest option based on the simple interval, it would be:\n\nB. box 2 (compound major 3rd)\n\nBut strictly speaking, the correct answer should be that none of the options fit, as they all refer to compound intervals."
