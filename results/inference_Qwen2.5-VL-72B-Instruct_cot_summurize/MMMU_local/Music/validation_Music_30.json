The melody includes Bb and C, which are part of C minor, but it also includes G, which is not a note in C minor. Therefore, C minor is not the correct key.\n\n2. **Eb major**: The notes in Eb major are Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, C, D. The melody includes all these notes (E, G, Bb, C, D), and they fit well within the Eb major scale. Therefore, Eb major is a strong candidate.\n\n3. **Ab major**: The notes in Ab major are Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G. The melody includes G, Bb, C, and D, but it does not include Ab or Db. Therefore, Ab major is not the correct key.\n\n4. **Db major**: The notes in Db major are Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C. The melody includes G, Bb, C, and D, but it does not include Db, Gb, or Ab. Therefore, Db major is not the correct key.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct key of the melody is Eb major.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\nB. circle the second option"
