However, it can be considered as an altered chord or a secondary dominant.\n\n4. **Consider the options:**\n   - A. Vb: This would imply a secondary dominant, but it doesn't fit here.\n   - B. Vc: This also implies a secondary dominant, which is not applicable.\n   - C. IIa: This suggests a secondary dominant, which is not fitting.\n   - D. IIb: This suggests a secondary dominant, which is not fitting.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most appropriate choice considering the context and the options provided is:\n\n**D. IIb**\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\nD. IIb"
