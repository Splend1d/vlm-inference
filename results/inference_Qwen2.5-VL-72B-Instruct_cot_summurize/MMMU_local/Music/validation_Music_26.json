Determine the notes in the F major scale.\n3. Identify the mediant (third degree) of the F major scale.\n4. Compare the identified mediant with the note shown in the image.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the key of F major\nThe key of F major has one flat, which is B-flat (B\u266d).\n\n### Step 2: Determine the notes in the F major scale\nThe F major scale is: F, G, A, B\u266d, C, D, E, F\n\n### Step 3: Identify the mediant (third degree) of the F major scale\nThe mediant is the third note in the scale. In the F major scale, the third note is A.\n\n### Step 4: Compare the identified mediant with the note shown in the image\nThe note shown in the image is A. This matches the mediant of the F major scale.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"This is the mediant in F major\" is true.\n\nThe answer is: \\boxed{A}"
