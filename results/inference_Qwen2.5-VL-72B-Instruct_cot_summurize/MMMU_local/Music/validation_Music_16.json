A compound dotted duration is one where a note or rest is extended by more than just a single dot (which typically adds half the value of the original note/rest).\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. The first image shows a series of rests with dots. Each dot extends the duration of the rest by half its value. This is a simple dotted duration, not a compound dotted duration.\n\nB. The second image shows a rest with two dots. The first dot extends the duration by half, and the second dot extends it by a quarter of the original value. This is a compound dotted duration.\n\nC. The third image shows a series of rests with dots. Each dot extends the duration of the rest by half its value. This is a simple dotted duration, not a compound dotted duration.\n\nD. The fourth image shows a rest with a single dot. This is a simple dotted duration, not a compound dotted duration.\n\nFrom the analysis, the rest that does not have a compound dotted duration is the one in option B, as it is the only one with two dots extending the duration in a compound manner.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is \\boxed{B}."
