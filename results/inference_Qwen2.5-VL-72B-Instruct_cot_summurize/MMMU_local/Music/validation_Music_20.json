Compound meters are those where the beats can be divided into three equal parts. Common examples of compound meters are 6/8, 9/8, and 12/8.\n\nLet's analyze each fragment:\n\n**Fragment A:**\n- The time signature is 6/8.\n- In 6/8 time, there are two beats per measure, and each beat is divided into three eighth notes.\n- This is a compound meter.\n\n**Fragment B:**\n- The time signature is 3/4.\n- In 3/4 time, there are three beats per measure, and each beat is divided into two quarter notes.\n- This is a simple meter, not a compound meter.\n\n**Fragment C:**\n- The time signature is 9/8.\n- In 9/8 time, there are three beats per measure, and each beat is divided into three eighth notes.\n- This is a compound meter.\n\n**Fragment D:**\n- The time signature is 12/8.\n- In 12/8 time, there are four beats per measure, and each beat is divided into three eighth notes.\n- This is a compound meter.\n\nBased on the analysis, the melody fragments that are in compound meters are A, C, and D.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is \\boxed{C}."
