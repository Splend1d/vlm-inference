In root position, it is represented as: Root - Major Third - Perfect Fifth - Minor Seventh.\n\nIn the first inversion, the third of the chord becomes the bass note. So, the chord will be arranged as: Major Third - Root - Perfect Fifth - Minor Seventh.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n**Option A:**\n- The chord is in root position (Root - Major Third - Perfect Fifth - Minor Seventh).\n\n**Option B:**\n- The chord is in first inversion (Major Third - Root - Perfect Fifth - Minor Seventh).\n\n**Option C:**\n- The chord is in second inversion (Perfect Fifth - Major Third - Root - Minor Seventh).\n\n**Option D:**\n- The chord is in third inversion (Minor Seventh - Perfect Fifth - Major Third - Root).\n\nFrom the analysis, we can see that Option B is in the first inversion of a major-minor seventh chord.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is \\boxed{B}."
