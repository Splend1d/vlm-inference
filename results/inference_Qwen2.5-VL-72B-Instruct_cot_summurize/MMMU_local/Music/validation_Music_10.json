In the bass clef, the second line from the top represents D.\n\n2. **Understand the key of E major**: The key of E major has four sharps: F#, C#, G#, and D#. The scale of E major is: E, F#, G#, A, B, C#, D#, E.\n\n3. **Determine the leading note**: The leading note in any major scale is the seventh note of the scale. For E major, the seventh note is D#.\n\n4. **Compare the note in the image with the leading note**: The note in the image is D, not D#. \n\nSince D is not the leading note (D#) in E major, the statement is false.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nB. False"
