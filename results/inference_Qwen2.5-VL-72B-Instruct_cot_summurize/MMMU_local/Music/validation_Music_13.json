The most common time signatures are:\n\n- 4/4 (common time)\n- 3/4 (waltz time)\n- 2/4\n- 6/8\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. 12/8: This is a compound meter and is not as common as the standard time signatures listed above.\nB. 12/8: Same as A, it is a compound meter.\nC. 7/8: This is an irregular meter and is not as common as the standard time signatures.\nD. 3/4: This is a standard time signature (waltz time).\n\nFrom the options given:\n- A and B both use 12/8, which is not a standard time signature.\n- C uses 7/8, which is not a standard time signature.\n- D uses 3/4, which is a standard time signature.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB.
