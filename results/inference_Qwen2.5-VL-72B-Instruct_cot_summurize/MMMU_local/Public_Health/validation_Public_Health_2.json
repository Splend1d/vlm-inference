The past alcohol consumption of the study subjects was investigated, along with variables such as age, sex, and body mass index (BMI>24 as overweight). Considering that body mass index may be a potential confounder when analysing the relationship between drinking alcohol and hypertension, it needs to be analysed and judged. The following table presents unstratified information on the relationship between the drinking alcohol and hypertensive disorders. <image 1> The cOR between the drinking alcohol and hypertensive is\n\nA. 1.70\nB. 2.50\nC. 3.20\nD. 4.80\n"
