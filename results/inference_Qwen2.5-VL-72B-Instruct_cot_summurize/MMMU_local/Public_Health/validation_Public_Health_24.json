Each line represents a case, and the onset of the disease is marked by a circle. Counting the circles, we find there are 10 new cases.\n\n2. **Determine the population at risk**: The population at the beginning of 2010 was given as 2,528. Since there were no births, deaths, in-migrants, or refusals to be examined during the period, the population remains constant at 2,528 throughout the year.\n\n3. **Calculate the incidence rate**: The incidence rate is the number of new cases divided by the population at risk, multiplied by 100 to get a percentage.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Incidence rate} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Number of new cases}}{\\text{Population at risk}} \\right) \\times 100 = \\left( \\frac{10}{2528} \\right) \\times 100\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Incidence rate} = \\left( \\frac{10}{2528} \\right) \\times 100 \\approx 0.3956\\%\n   \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the incidence rate is approximately 0.40%.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is \\boxed{B}."
