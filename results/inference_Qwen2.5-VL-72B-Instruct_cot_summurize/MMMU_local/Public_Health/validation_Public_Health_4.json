While nematodes can be ectoparasites, they are not classified as viruses, bacteria, or protozoa.\n\nGiven the options:\n\nA. Some viruses - Viruses are not ectoparasites; they are intracellular parasites.\nB. Some bacteria - Bacteria can be parasites, but they are not typically classified as ectoparasites.\nC. Some protozoa - Protozoa can be parasites, but they are not typically classified as ectoparasites.\nD. Some insects - Insects such as fleas and lice are examples of ectoparasites.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nD. Some insects"
