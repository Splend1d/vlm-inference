It is not suitable for comparing proportions or categorical data.\n  \n- **Fisher's Exact test**: This test is used to determine if there is a significant association between two categorical variables in a 2x2 contingency table. It is particularly useful when sample sizes are small. Given the relatively large sample sizes in this case, it could still be applicable but may not be the most powerful choice.\n\n- **Kappa**: This statistic measures the agreement between two raters who each classify items into mutually exclusive categories. It is not suitable for comparing proportions of outcomes between two groups.\n\n- **McNemar's test**: This test is used to analyze paired nominal data. It is typically used in before-and-after studies or matched pairs. Since the data here are not paired, this test is not appropriate.\n\nGiven the nature of the data (categorical with counts in a contingency table), the most appropriate test would be **Fisher's Exact test**. Although the sample size is relatively large, Fisher's Exact test remains a valid choice and is often preferred for its accuracy in handling categorical data.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is:\n**B. Fisher's Exact test**."
