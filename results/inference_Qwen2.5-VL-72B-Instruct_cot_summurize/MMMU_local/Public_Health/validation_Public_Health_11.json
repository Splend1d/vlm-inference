This information is not directly available from the table.\n2. **AR**: Requires the incidence rates in the exposed and unexposed groups. The table provides counts but not rates.\n3. **RR**: Can be calculated if we have the incidence rates or can estimate them from the provided counts.\n4. **OR**: Can be calculated directly from the counts provided in the table.\n\n### Calculating the Odds Ratio (OR):\nThe formula for the Odds Ratio is:\n\\[ \\text{OR} = \\frac{(a \\times d)}{(b \\times c)} \\]\nwhere:\n- \\( a \\) = Number of smokers with lung cancer = 150\n- \\( b \\) = Number of non-smokers with lung cancer = 100\n- \\( c \\) = Number of smokers without lung cancer = 50\n- \\( d \\) = Number of non-smokers without lung cancer = 200\n\nSubstitute the values into the formula:\n\\[ \\text{OR} = \\frac{(150 \\times 200)}{(100 \\times 50)} = \\frac{30000}{5000} = 6 \\]\n\nThus, the Odds Ratio (OR) can be calculated from the given data.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe correct answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{D}\n\\]"
