One of the studies was from Jiangsu Province, China, and the study design was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial (phase III trial), which included a total of 10,077 healthy children aged 6-35 months. The primary outcome indicator was the incidence of EV71-related hand, foot and mouth disease or herpangina, according to the 0- and 28-day immunisation schedule, using block (one group of 10 persons) randomisation, with a 1:1 allocation of study participants to EV71 vaccine or placebo, and follow-up monitoring for 12 months, and the results were shown in the table below.<image 1> The protective rate against all EV71 related diseases was\n\nA. 100%\nB. 94.8%\nC. 94.6%\nD. 88.1%\n"
