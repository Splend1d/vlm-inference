To investigate whether this association also exists in the Chinese population, the University of Oxford (UK), in collaboration with Professor Li Liming's group at the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (CAMS), recruited 512,891 adults aged 30-79 years from 10 different regions of China (including five cities and five villages) between June 2004 and July 2008, to investigate the association between the use of fresh fruits and major cardiovascular diseases in the Chinese population. The study investigated the relationship between fresh fruit use and major cardiovascular diseases in the Chinese population. Five frequency criteria were set for the main exposure factor \"fruit intake\": \"never eat fruit\", \"once a month\", \"1-3 times a week\", \"4-6 times a week\", \"every day \", which were filled in by the respondents themselves.The primary cardiovascular disease death was used as the outcome event in this study. Survival and health status of all subjects were regularly reported to the disease surveillance system of the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and their data were checked against the health insurance records of the investigated subjects' localities and confirmed by the street or village committees. Coding was based on the 10th edition of the International Classification of Diseases.After 3.2 million person-years of follow-up, a total of 451,665 subjects completed the follow-up after excluding lost and ineligible subjects. Those who consumed fresh fruit daily were found to have a mean reduction in systolic blood pressure of about 4 mmHg, a reduction in blood glucose of about 0.5 mmol/L, a 40% reduction in the risk of cardiovascular death, and a 34%, 25%, and 36% reduction in the risk of major coronary heart disease events, ischemic strokes, and cerebral hemorrhages, respectively, when compared with those who consumed very little fresh fruit. Their fruit intake and cardiovascular disease profiles were shown in the table below.<image 1>What indicators were appropriate for describing the risk of morbidity in various groups of the population?\n\nA. point prevalence and period prevalence\nB. mortality rate and case fatality rate\nC. cumulative incidence and incidence density\nD.

Point Prevalence and Period Prevalence\n- **Point Prevalence**: The proportion of a population that has a condition at a specific point in time.\n- **Period Prevalence**: The proportion of a population that has a condition over a specified period.\n\nThese measures describe the burden of disease at a particular time or over a period but do not directly measure the risk of developing the disease.\n\n### B. Mortality Rate and Case Fatality Rate\n- **Mortality Rate**: The number of deaths in a given time period divided by the size of the population at risk during the same time period.\n- **Case Fatality Rate**: The proportion of individuals diagnosed with a disease who die from that disease within a specified time period.\n\nWhile these rates provide information about deaths, they do not specifically describe the risk of developing the disease itself.\n\n### C. Cumulative Incidence and Incidence Density\n- **Cumulative Incidence**: The proportion of a population that develops a new case of a disease over a specified period.\n- **Incidence Density**: The number of new cases of a disease in a population over a specified period, taking into account the amount of time each individual was at risk.\n\nThese measures directly assess the risk of developing a disease, making them suitable for describing the risk of morbidity in various groups.\n\n### D. PYLL and DALY\n- **PYLL (Potential Years of Life Lost)**: A measure of premature mortality, representing the sum of the differences between an age at death and a reference age.\n- **DALY (Disability-Adjusted Life Year)**: A measure of overall disease burden, expressing the number of years lost due to ill-health, disability, or early death.\n\nThese measures quantify the impact of disease on life expectancy and quality of life but do not directly describe the risk of developing the disease.\n\nGiven the context of the study, which aims to investigate the association between fruit intake and the development of cardiovascular diseases, the most appropriate indicators for describing the risk of morbidity would be:\n\n**C. Cumulative Incidence and Incidence Density**\n\nThese measures will help in understanding how different levels of fruit intake affect the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases over time."
