Specificity is the proportion of true negatives (people without the disease who test negative) out of all the people who do not have the disease.\n\nFrom the given table:\n\n- \\( A \\): True positives (people with the disease who test positive)\n- \\( B \\): False positives (people without the disease who test positive)\n- \\( C \\): False negatives (people with the disease who test negative)\n- \\( D \\): True negatives (people without the disease who test negative)\n\nSpecificity is calculated as the number of true negatives divided by the total number of people without the disease. Mathematically, this is represented as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Specificity} = \\frac{\\text{True Negatives}}{\\text{Total without disease}} = \\frac{D}{B + D} \\]\n\nSo, the correct choice is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{D}\n\\]"
