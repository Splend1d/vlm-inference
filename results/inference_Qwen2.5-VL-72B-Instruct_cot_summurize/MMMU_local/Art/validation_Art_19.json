The figures and the path occupy most of the image, leaving relatively little negative space.\n- **Photo 2**: This photo shows a series of cylindrical objects with holes, emitting light. The dark background contrasts with the illuminated objects, creating a sense of negative space around the objects.\n- **Photo 3**: This photo shows two large brick structures against a clear sky. The sky provides a significant amount of negative space that contrasts with the solid structures.\n\nBoth Photo 2 and Photo 3 use negative space effectively, but Photo 3 has a more pronounced and expansive use of negative space due to the large area of sky.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Photos 2 & 3"
