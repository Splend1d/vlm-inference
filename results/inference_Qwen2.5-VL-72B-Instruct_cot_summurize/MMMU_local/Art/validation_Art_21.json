The specific version you have shown is by Artemisia Gentileschi, painted between 1612 and 1613.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Artemisia Gentileschi 1612-13\n\nArtemisia Gentileschi's rendition of this scene is notable for its intense emotion and dramatic use of light and shadow, characteristic of the Baroque style. The painting depicts the biblical story of Judith beheading Holofernes, a narrative that Gentileschi may have used to express her own experiences and emotions, especially in light of her personal trauma and the social context of her time."
