The story includes themes of transformation and underwater adventures.\n\n2. **The Little Mermaid by Hans Christian Andersen (1836)**: This well-known fairy tale tells the story of a young mermaid who wishes to become human and falls in love with a prince. It is a classic story about mermaids but focuses on a single character rather than a group.\n\n3. **Around the World in 80 Days by Jules Verne (1873)**: This novel is an adventure story about a man named Phileas Fogg who bets he can travel around the world in 80 days. It does not feature mermaids or significant underwater elements.\n\n4. **Moby-Dick by Herman Melville (1851)**: This novel is about a whaling voyage and the obsession of Captain Ahab with hunting the white whale Moby Dick. It does not prominently feature mermaids.\n\nGiven that the painting depicts multiple mermaids in a serene and mythological setting, it aligns more closely with the themes and imagery found in \"The Water Babies,\" which includes various sea creatures and mermaids in its narrative.\n\nTherefore, the most likely source of inspiration for the painting is:\n\n**A. The Water Babies by Charles Kingsley (1863)**."
