Among the options provided, Henry Moore is the most likely to have been influenced by these ancient sculptures.\n\nHenry Moore was particularly interested in the human form and often incorporated elements of ancient art into his work. His reclining figures bear a striking resemblance to the chacmool sculptures in terms of posture and form. Moore's sculptures frequently feature elongated, curvilinear forms that echo the fluid lines and dynamic poses found in Mayan art.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Henry Moore"
