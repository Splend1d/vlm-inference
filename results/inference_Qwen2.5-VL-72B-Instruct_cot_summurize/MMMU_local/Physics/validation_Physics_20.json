According to the photoelectric effect equation:\n\n\\[ E_{km} = hf - \\phi \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(E_{km}\\) is the maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectrons,\n- \\(h\\) is Planck's constant,\n- \\(f\\) is the frequency of the incident photons,\n- \\(\\phi\\) is the work function of the material.\n\nFrom the graph, we can see that the maximum kinetic energy \\(E_{km}\\) is zero when the frequency \\(f\\) is approximately \\(4 \\times 10^{14} \\, \\text{Hz}\\). This frequency is known as the threshold frequency \\(f_0\\), and at this frequency, the energy of the incident photon is just enough to overcome the work function of the material. Therefore, we can write:\n\n\\[ hf_0 = \\phi \\]\n\nFrom the graph, the threshold frequency \\(f_0\\) is approximately \\(4 \\times 10^{14} \\, \\text{Hz}\\). To find the work function \\(\\phi\\), we use the value of Planck's constant \\(h = 6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\, \\text{J} \\cdot \\text{s}\\):\n\n\\[ \\phi = h f_0 = 6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\, \\text{J} \\cdot \\text{s} \\times 4 \\times 10^{14} \\, \\text{Hz} \\]\n\nConverting the work function from joules to electron volts (1 eV = \\(1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{J}\\)):\n\n\\[ \\phi = \\frac{6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\times 4 \\times 10^{14}}{1.602 \\times 10^{-19}} \\, \\text{eV} \\approx 1.65 \\, \\text{eV} \\]\n\nHowever, the closest option to this value is 1.5 eV. Therefore, the approximate work function of the material is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1.5 \\, \\text{eV}}\n\\]"
