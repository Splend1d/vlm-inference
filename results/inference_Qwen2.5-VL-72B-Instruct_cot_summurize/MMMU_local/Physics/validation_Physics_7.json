It is always between 0 and 1 for ellipses.\n- A value less than zero is not possible for an ellipse.\n- Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n### Option B: The eccentricity of the orbit is greater than 1.\n- As mentioned, the eccentricity of an ellipse is always between 0 and 1.\n- A value greater than 1 would indicate a hyperbola, not an ellipse.\n- Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n### Option C: The sun might be at point C.\n- In an elliptical orbit, the Sun is located at one of the foci of the ellipse.\n- Point C appears to be near the center of the ellipse but not at a focus.\n- Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n### Option D: The sun might be at point D.\n- Point D is closer to the center of the ellipse but still not at a focus.\n- Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n### Option E: The sun might be at point B.\n- Point B is located at one of the foci of the ellipse.\n- According to Kepler's laws, the Sun must be at one of the foci of the elliptical orbit.\n- Therefore, this statement is true.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n\\boxed{E}"
