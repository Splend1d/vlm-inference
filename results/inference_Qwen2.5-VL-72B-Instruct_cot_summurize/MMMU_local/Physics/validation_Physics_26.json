The velocity of an object is the rate of change of its position with respect to time. When the velocity is zero, the object is not moving forward or backward; it is stationary.\n\nLet's examine each point on the graph:\n\n- Point A: The velocity is positive and increasing. This means the duck is moving forward and accelerating.\n- Point B: The velocity is at its maximum positive value. This means the duck is moving forward at its fastest speed.\n- Point C: The velocity is positive but decreasing. This means the duck is still moving forward but decelerating.\n- Point D: The velocity is zero. This means the duck is not moving forward or backward; it is stationary.\n\nTherefore, the duck stopped its forward motion at point D.\n\nThe correct answer is \\boxed{D}."
