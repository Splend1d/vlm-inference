This means that if the tractor exerts a force on the trailer, the trailer will exert an equal and opposite force on the tractor.\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the forces involved:**\n   - The tractor exerts a force on the trailer.\n   - The trailer exerts a force on the tractor.\n\n2. **Apply Newton's Third Law:**\n   - According to Newton's Third Law, the force exerted by the tractor on the trailer (action) is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to the force exerted by the trailer on the tractor (reaction).\n\n3. **Consider the masses:**\n   - The mass of the trailer is 4 times the mass of the tractor. However, the mass does not affect the equality of the forces according to Newton's Third Law. The forces are always equal and opposite regardless of the masses involved.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The force that the trailer applies on the tractor is equal to the force that the tractor applies on the trailer.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n\\boxed{C}"
