Use the formula for average speed: \\(\\text{average speed} = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{time}}\\).\n\nFrom the diagram:\n- At 3 seconds, the ball is at 9 cm.\n- At 4 seconds, the ball is at 16 cm.\n\nThe distance traveled between 3 and 4 seconds is:\n\\[ \\text{distance} = 16 \\, \\text{cm} - 9 \\, \\text{cm} = 7 \\, \\text{cm} \\]\n\nThe time interval between 3 and 4 seconds is:\n\\[ \\text{time} = 4 \\, \\text{s} - 3 \\, \\text{s} = 1 \\, \\text{s} \\]\n\nNow, we can calculate the average speed:\n\\[ \\text{average speed} = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{time}} = \\frac{7 \\, \\text{cm}}{1 \\, \\text{s}} = 7 \\, \\text{cm/s} \\]\n\nTherefore, the average speed of the ball between 3 and 4 seconds is \\(\\boxed{7.0 \\, \\text{cm/s}}\\).\n\nThe correct choice is \\(\\boxed{B}\\)."
