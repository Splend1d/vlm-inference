                    "text": "To determine the force exerted by the rope on the uniform rod, we need to analyze the torques acting on the rod about a suitable pivot point. The key is to choose a pivot point that simplifies the problem by eliminating some of the unknown forces.\n\nLet's consider the torques about each of the points given in the options:\n\n### Point 1:\nIf we take the pivot at point 1 (the top end of the rod), the torque due to the tension in the rope will be zero because the line of action of the tension passes through the pivot point. However, the weight of the rod will create a torque about this point, and we will also have to consider the reaction force at the wall, which complicates the problem.\n\n### Point 2:\nIf we take the pivot at point 2 (the bottom end of the rod where it touches the wall), the torque due to the reaction force at the wall will be zero. The weight of the rod and the tension in the rope will both create torques about this point. This setup allows us to write a simpler torque equation involving only the weight of the rod and the tension in the rope.\n\n### Point 3:\nIf we take the pivot at point 3 (somewhere along the rod), the torques due to the weight of the rod and the tension in the rope will both be non-zero, and we will also have to consider the reaction force at the wall, which complicates the problem.\n\n### Point 4:\nIf we take the pivot at point 4 (the point where the rod touches the horizontal surface), the torque due to the reaction force at the wall will be non-zero, and we will also have to consider the weight of the rod and the tension in the rope, which complicates the problem.\n\nFrom the above analysis, the simplest choice is to take the pivot at point 2, where the reaction force at the wall does not create a torque. Therefore, we can write a single equation for the force exerted by the rope by considering the torques about point 2.\n\nThe correct answer is: \\boxed{B}"
