Since the magnetic field is perpendicular to the plane of the loop (\\(\\theta = 0^\\circ\\)), \\(\\cos(0^\\circ) = 1\\).\n\nGiven:\n- \\(B = 0.4 \\, \\text{T}\\)\n- Side length of the square loop \\(s = 0.5 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n- Area \\(A = s^2 = (0.5 \\, \\text{m})^2 = 0.25 \\, \\text{m}^2\\)\n\nInitial magnetic flux \\(\\Phi_i\\):\n\\[\n\\Phi_i = B \\cdot A = 0.4 \\, \\text{T} \\cdot 0.25 \\, \\text{m}^2 = 0.1 \\, \\text{Wb}\n\\]\n\nFinal magnetic flux \\(\\Phi_f\\) when the field is reduced to zero:\n\\[\n\\Phi_f = 0 \\, \\text{Wb}\n\\]\n\nChange in magnetic flux \\(\\Delta \\Phi\\):\n\\[\n\\Delta \\Phi = \\Phi_f - \\Phi_i = 0 \\, \\text{Wb} - 0.1 \\, \\text{Wb} = -0.1 \\, \\text{Wb}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the induced emf using Faraday's Law\n\nFaraday's Law states that the induced emf \\(\\mathcal{E}\\) is given by:\n\\[\n\\mathcal{E} = -\\frac{\\Delta \\Phi}{\\Delta t}\n\\]\n\nGiven:\n- \\(\\Delta t = 2 \\, \\text{s}\\)\n\nInduced emf:\n\\[\n\\mathcal{E} = -\\frac{-0.1 \\, \\text{Wb}}{2 \\, \\text{s}} = 0.05 \\, \\text{V}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the induced current using Ohm's Law\n\nOhm's Law states that the current \\(I\\) is given by:\n\\[\nI = \\frac{\\mathcal{E}}{R}\n\\]\n\nGiven:\n- Resistance \\(R = 10^{-2} \\, \\Omega\\)\n\nInduced current:\n\\[\nI = \\frac{0.05 \\, \\text{V}}{10^{-2} \\, \\Omega} = 5 \\, \\text{A}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Determine the direction of the current using Lenz's Law\n\nLenz's Law states that the induced current will flow in such a direction as to oppose the change that produced it. Since the magnetic field is decreasing, the induced current will create a magnetic field that opposes this decrease, i.e., it will try to maintain the original magnetic field.\n\nUsing the right-hand rule, if you point your thumb in the direction of the original magnetic field (out of the page), your fingers will curl in the direction of the induced current. This gives a counterclockwise direction for the current.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe magnitude of the current is \\(5 \\, \\text{A}\\) and the direction is counterclockwise.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{B. 5 \\, \\text{A}, \\text{counterclockwise}}\n\\]"
