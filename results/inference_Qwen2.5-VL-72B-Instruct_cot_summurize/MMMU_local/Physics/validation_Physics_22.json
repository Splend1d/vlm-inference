Therefore, a higher frequency corresponds to a shorter wavelength.\n   - The speed of light \\( c \\) is constant in a vacuum and does not depend on the frequency or wavelength of the light.\n\n6. **Momentum:**\n   - The momentum of a photon is given by \\( p = \\frac{E}{c} \\). Since the energy of the photon is higher for the \\( n=3 \\) to \\( n=1 \\) transition, the momentum will also be greater.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n\\boxed{D}"
