Torque (\\(\\tau\\)) is defined as the product of the force (\\(F\\)) and the perpendicular distance (\\(r_{\\perp}\\)) from the pivot point to the line of action of the force. Mathematically, it is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\tau = F \\cdot r_{\\perp}\n\\]\n\nIn the given problem, the force \\(F\\) is applied at an angle \\(\\theta\\) to the rod. The perpendicular distance from the pivot point to the line of action of the force is \\(L \\sin \\theta\\). Therefore, the torque produced by the force \\(F\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\tau = F \\cdot L \\sin \\theta\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to find the distance \\(d\\) from the axis where the force \\(F\\) should be applied perpendicularly to produce the same torque. When the force is applied perpendicularly, the perpendicular distance is simply \\(d\\). So, the torque in this case is:\n\n\\[\n\\tau = F \\cdot d\n\\]\n\nSince we want the torque to be the same in both cases, we set the two expressions for torque equal to each other:\n\n\\[\nF \\cdot d = F \\cdot L \\sin \\theta\n\\]\n\nWe can cancel \\(F\\) from both sides of the equation (assuming \\(F \\neq 0\\)):\n\n\\[\nd = L \\sin \\theta\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the distance from the axis where the force \\(F\\) should be applied perpendicularly to produce the same torque is \\(L \\sin \\theta\\).\n\nThe correct answer is \\(\\boxed{A}\\)."
