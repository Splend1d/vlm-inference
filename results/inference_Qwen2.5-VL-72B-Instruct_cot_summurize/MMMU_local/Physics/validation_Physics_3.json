According to the right-hand rule, the magnetic field lines around this wire will be in the form of concentric circles in the plane of the page, directed counterclockwise when viewed from above.\n\n2. **Magnetic Field at the Position of the Right-Hand Wire:**\n   - At the position of the right-hand wire, which is a distance \\( d \\) away from the left-hand wire, the magnetic field due to the left-hand wire will be directed out of the page (since it's on the opposite side of the wire where the field lines are coming out).\n\n3. **Force on the Right-Hand Wire:**\n   - The right-hand wire also carries a current \\( i \\) into the page. The force on a current-carrying wire in a magnetic field is given by the Lorentz force law: \\( \\mathbf{F} = I \\mathbf{L} \\times \\mathbf{B} \\).\n   - Here, \\( \\mathbf{L} \\) is the length vector of the wire (directed into the page), and \\( \\mathbf{B} \\) is the magnetic field (directed out of the page).\n   - Using the right-hand rule for the cross product \\( \\mathbf{L} \\times \\mathbf{B} \\):\n     - Point your right-hand thumb in the direction of \\( \\mathbf{L} \\) (into the page).\n     - Point your fingers in the direction of \\( \\mathbf{B} \\) (out of the page).\n     - Your palm will point in the direction of the force \\( \\mathbf{F} \\), which is to the left.\n\nTherefore, the direction of the force on the right-hand wire due to the current in the left-hand wire is to the left.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nB. to the left"
