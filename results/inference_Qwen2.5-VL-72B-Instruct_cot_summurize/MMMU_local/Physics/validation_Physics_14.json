                    "text": "To determine the relationship between the speeds of light in the three media, we need to use Snell's Law and the fact that the speed of light is inversely proportional to the refractive index of the medium. Snell's Law states:\n\n\\[ n_1 \\sin \\theta_1 = n_2 \\sin \\theta_2 \\]\n\nwhere \\( n_1 \\) and \\( n_2 \\) are the refractive indices of the two media, and \\( \\theta_1 \\) and \\( \\theta_2 \\) are the angles of incidence and refraction, respectively.\n\nFrom the diagram, we can see that the light beam bends towards the normal when it goes from medium 1 to medium 2, and then it bends away from the normal when it goes from medium 2 to medium 3. This indicates the following relationships:\n\n1. When light goes from medium 1 to medium 2, it bends towards the normal, which means \\( n_2 > n_1 \\). Since the speed of light is inversely proportional to the refractive index, this implies \\( v_1 > v_2 \\).\n2. When light goes from medium 2 to medium 3, it bends away from the normal, which means \\( n_3 < n_2 \\). This implies \\( v_3 > v_2 \\).\n\nCombining these two pieces of information, we get:\n\n\\[ v_1 > v_2 \\]\n\\[ v_3 > v_2 \\]\n\nHowever, we also need to compare \\( v_1 \\) and \\( v_3 \\). From the diagram, we can infer that the angle of incidence in medium 1 is greater than the angle of refraction in medium 3, which suggests that \\( n_3 < n_1 \\). Therefore, \\( v_3 > v_1 \\).\n\nSo, the correct order of the speeds of light in the three media is:\n\n\\[ v_3 > v_1 > v_2 \\]\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n\\boxed{A}"
