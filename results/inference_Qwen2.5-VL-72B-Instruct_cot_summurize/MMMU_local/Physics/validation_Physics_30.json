However, we need to consider the possible interpretation of the problem.\n\n5. **Re-evaluate the problem with the given options:**\n   - The problem might be asking for the wavelength of one of the component traveling waves that form the standing wave.\n   - In a standing wave, the component traveling waves have half the wavelength of the standing wave.\n   - Therefore, the wavelength of one of the component traveling waves is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{\\lambda}{2} = \\frac{3 \\text{ meters}}{2} = 1.5 \\text{ meters}\n     \\]\n\nGiven the options, the closest match is:\n\n\\boxed{C}"
