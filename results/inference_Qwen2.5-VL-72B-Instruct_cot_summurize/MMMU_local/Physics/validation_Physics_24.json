Adding an alpha particle would increase both the mass number by 4 and the atomic number by 2, which does not match our requirements.\n   - **Electron (\\(e^-\\)):** Adding an electron does not change the mass number but can change the atomic number by 1 if it is captured by the nucleus. This also does not match our requirements.\n   - **Neutron (\\(n\\)):** A neutron has a mass number of 1 and an atomic number of 0. Adding a neutron increases the mass number by 1 and leaves the atomic number unchanged, which matches our requirements.\n   - **Proton (\\(p\\)):** A proton has a mass number of 1 and an atomic number of 1. Adding a proton increases both the mass number by 1 and the atomic number by 1, which does not match our requirements.\n\nSince adding a neutron is the only option that increases the mass number by 1 and keeps the atomic number the same, the \"?\" must represent a neutron.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{C}}\n\\]"
