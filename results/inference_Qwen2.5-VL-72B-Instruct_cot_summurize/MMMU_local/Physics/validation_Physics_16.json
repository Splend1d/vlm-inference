The average velocity is given by the displacement vector divided by the time taken.\n\n1. **Identify the initial and final positions:**\n   - The particle starts at point P.\n   - The particle ends at point Q, which is exactly halfway around the circle from point P.\n\n2. **Determine the displacement:**\n   - Since point Q is exactly halfway around the circle from point P, the displacement vector points directly from P to Q.\n   - In a circular path, if you move halfway around the circle, you end up on the opposite side of the circle. Therefore, the displacement vector will be a straight line passing through the center of the circle from P to Q.\n\n3. **Direction of the displacement vector:**\n   - If we assume the circle is centered at the origin and point P is on the right side of the circle, then point Q will be on the left side of the circle.\n   - The displacement vector from P to Q will point leftward.\n\n4. **Average velocity:**\n   - The average velocity is the displacement vector divided by the time taken. Since the displacement vector points leftward, the average velocity will also point leftward.\n\nTherefore, the direction of the average velocity during this time interval is \\boxed{B}."
