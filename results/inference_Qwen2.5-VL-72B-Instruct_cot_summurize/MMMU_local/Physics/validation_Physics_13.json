The area under the velocity-time graph represents the displacement of the object. When the object returns to its initial position, the total displacement will be zero.\n\nLet's break down the graph into segments and calculate the area for each segment:\n\n1. **From \\( t = 0 \\) to \\( t = 1 \\) second:**\n   - The velocity is negative and forms a triangle.\n   - The base of the triangle is 1 second.\n   - The height of the triangle is -1 m/s.\n   - Area = \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1 \\times (-1) = -0.5 \\) meters.\n\n2. **From \\( t = 1 \\) to \\( t = 2 \\) second:**\n   - The velocity increases linearly from -1 m/s to 2 m/s, forming a trapezoid.\n   - The area can be calculated as the sum of a triangle and a rectangle.\n   - Triangle area: \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times 1 \\times (2 - (-1)) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1 \\times 3 = 1.5 \\) meters.\n   - Rectangle area: \\(1 \\times 1 = 1 \\) meter.\n   - Total area = \\(1.5 + 1 = 2.5 \\) meters.\n\n3. **From \\( t = 2 \\) to \\( t = 3 \\) second:**\n   - The velocity is constant at 2 m/s.\n   - The area is a rectangle.\n   - Area = \\(1 \\times 2 = 2 \\) meters.\n\n4. **From \\( t = 3 \\) to \\( t = 4 \\) second:**\n   - The velocity decreases linearly from 2 m/s to 0 m/s, forming a triangle.\n   - The area is \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times 1 \\times 2 = 1 \\) meter.\n\nNow, let's sum up the areas to find the total displacement at different times:\n\n- At \\( t = 1 \\) second: Displacement = -0.5 meters.\n- At \\( t = 2 \\) second: Displacement = -0.5 + 2.5 = 2 meters.\n- At \\( t = 3 \\) second: Displacement = 2 + 2 = 4 meters.\n- At \\( t = 4 \\) second: Displacement = 4 + 1 = 5 meters.\n\nWe need to find when the displacement becomes zero. We see that the displacement is not zero at any of the integer seconds. Let's check between 1 and 2 seconds:\n\n- At \\( t = 1 \\) second: Displacement = -0.5 meters.\n- At \\( t = 2 \\) second: Displacement = 2 meters.\n\nThe displacement changes from negative to positive between 1 and 2 seconds. Therefore, the object must pass through its initial position between 1 and 2 seconds.\n\nThus, the correct answer is \\(\\boxed{B}\\)."
