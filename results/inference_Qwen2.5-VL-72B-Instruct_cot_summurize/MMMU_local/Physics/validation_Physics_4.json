We need to find the index of refraction of the plastic (\\( n_2 \\)).\n\nUsing Snell's Law:\n\\[ 1 \\cdot \\sin 37^\\circ = n_2 \\cdot \\sin 53^\\circ \\]\n\nWe know that:\n\\[ \\sin 37^\\circ \\approx 0.602 \\]\n\\[ \\sin 53^\\circ \\approx 0.799 \\]\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation:\n\\[ 1 \\cdot 0.602 = n_2 \\cdot 0.799 \\]\n\\[ 0.602 = n_2 \\cdot 0.799 \\]\n\nSolving for \\( n_2 \\):\n\\[ n_2 = \\frac{0.602}{0.799} \\approx 0.754 \\]\n\nThe speed of light in a medium is given by:\n\\[ v = \\frac{c}{n} \\]\n\nwhere \\( c \\) is the speed of light in vacuum (\\( 3 \\times 10^8 \\) m/s) and \\( n \\) is the index of refraction of the medium.\n\nSo, the speed of light in the plastic is:\n\\[ v = \\frac{3 \\times 10^8}{0.754} \\approx 3.98 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s} \\]\n\nHowever, the question asks for the speed of light in the plastic in units of \\( 10^8 \\) m/s. Therefore:\n\\[ v \\approx 3.98 \\]\n\nSince the closest option to 3.98 is 4.00, the correct answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{0.88} \\]"
