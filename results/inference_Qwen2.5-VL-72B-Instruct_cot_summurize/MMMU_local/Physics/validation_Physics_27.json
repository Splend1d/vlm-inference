Given that all resistors have the same resistance, the circuit can be simplified by recognizing its symmetry.\n\nLet's label the resistors as follows:\n- Top branch: \\( R_1 \\) (between T and W), \\( R_2 \\) (between W and U), \\( R_3 \\) (between U and P)\n- Bottom branch: \\( R_4 \\) (between T and S), \\( R_5 \\) (between S and Q), \\( R_6 \\) (between Q and P)\n\nSince all resistors are equal, let's denote their resistance as \\( R \\).\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Symmetry:**\n   The circuit is symmetric about the vertical line passing through points S and U. This means that the potential at point S is the same as the potential at point U.\n\n2. **Potential at Points:**\n   - Since the circuit is symmetric, the current splits equally at point T and recombines at point P.\n   - The potential difference across each resistor in the top branch will be the same as the potential difference across each resistor in the bottom branch.\n\n3. **Voltmeter Readings:**\n   - If the voltmeter is connected between points S and U, it will measure the potential difference between these two points.\n   - Due to the symmetry, the potential at point S is the same as the potential at point U. Therefore, the potential difference between S and U is zero.\n\nThus, the voltmeter will read zero when connected between points S and U.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{D}\n\\]"
