Therefore, the relationship between \\( P \\) and \\( I \\) is quadratic.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given graphs:\n\n- **Graph A**: This graph shows a curve that starts at the origin and increases rapidly as \\( I \\) increases. This is consistent with a quadratic relationship \\( P = I^2R \\).\n\n- **Graph B**: This graph shows a straight line that starts at the origin and decreases linearly as \\( I \\) increases. This does not match the quadratic relationship.\n\n- **Graph C**: This graph shows a straight line that starts at the origin and increases linearly as \\( I \\) increases. This does not match the quadratic relationship.\n\n- **Graph D**: This graph shows a curve that starts at the origin and decreases as \\( I \\) increases. This does not match the quadratic relationship.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct graph that shows how power dissipated \\( P \\) varies with current \\( I \\) in a component that obeys Ohm's law is Graph A.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{A}\n\\]"
