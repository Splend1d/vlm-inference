The maximum kinetic energy is attained as the sphere passes through its equilibrium position.**\n- For the mass-spring system: As \\( m_1 \\) passes through the equilibrium position, all the potential energy stored in the spring is converted into kinetic energy, making the kinetic energy maximum.\n- For the simple pendulum: As \\( m_2 \\) passes through the equilibrium position, all the gravitational potential energy is converted into kinetic energy, making the kinetic energy maximum.\n- This statement is true for both systems.\n\n**B. The minimum gravitational potential energy is attained as the sphere passes through its equilibrium position.**\n- For the mass-spring system: The gravitational potential energy depends on the height relative to some reference level. If we consider the reference level at the equilibrium position, the gravitational potential energy is not necessarily minimized there because the vertical displacement due to the spring's stretch/compression affects it.\n- For the simple pendulum: The gravitational potential energy is indeed minimized at the equilibrium position since it is the lowest point in the swing.\n- This statement is not universally true for both systems.\n\n**C. The maximum gravitational potential energy is attained when the sphere reaches its point of release.**\n- For the mass-spring system: The gravitational potential energy can be higher or lower depending on the initial displacement and the reference level chosen.\n- For the simple pendulum: The gravitational potential energy is maximized at the point of release since it is the highest point in the swing.\n- This statement is not universally true for both systems.\n\n**D. The maximum total energy is attained only as the sphere passes through its equilibrium position.**\n- For both systems: The total mechanical energy (kinetic + potential) is conserved and remains constant throughout the motion. It does not change as the sphere passes through any position.\n- This statement is false for both systems.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe correct answer is:\n**A. The maximum kinetic energy is attained as the sphere passes through its equilibrium position.**"
