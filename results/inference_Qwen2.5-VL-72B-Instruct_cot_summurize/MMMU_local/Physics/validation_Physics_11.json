The wavelength of the orange light in air is given as 600 nm.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Wavelength in Glass:**\n   The wavelength of light in a medium with refractive index \\( n \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\lambda_{\\text{glass}} = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{air}}}{n_{\\text{glass}}}\n   \\]\n   For orange light (\\(\\lambda_{\\text{air}} = 600 \\text{ nm}\\)) and glass (\\(n_{\\text{glass}} = 1.50\\)):\n   \\[\n   \\lambda_{\\text{glass}} = \\frac{600 \\text{ nm}}{1.50} = 400 \\text{ nm}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Condition for Constructive Interference:**\n   For constructive interference in the reflected light from a thin film, the path difference must be an integer multiple of the wavelength in the film. Since the light is incident normally, the path difference is twice the thickness \\( t \\) of the glass layer:\n   \\[\n   2t = m \\lambda_{\\text{glass}}\n   \\]\n   where \\( m \\) is an integer (1, 2, 3, ...).\n\n3. **Minimum Thickness:**\n   To find the minimum thickness, we set \\( m = 1 \\):\n   \\[\n   2t = 1 \\times 400 \\text{ nm}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   t = \\frac{400 \\text{ nm}}{2} = 200 \\text{ nm}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the minimum thickness of the glass that gives the reflected light an orange-like color is \\(\\boxed{200 \\text{ nm}}\\)."
