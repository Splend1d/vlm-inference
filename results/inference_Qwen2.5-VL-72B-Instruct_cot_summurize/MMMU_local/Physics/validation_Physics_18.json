                    "text": "To determine which bulbs become brighter when the switch is closed, we need to analyze the circuit step by step.\n\n1. **Initial State (Switch Open):**\n   - The circuit consists of three bulbs: #1, #2, and #3.\n   - Bulb #1 is in series with the parallel combination of bulbs #2 and #3.\n   - The current through bulb #1 will be the same as the total current through the parallel combination of bulbs #2 and #3.\n   - Since all bulbs are identical, the voltage across each bulb in the parallel combination will be the same, and the current through each will be half of the total current through the parallel combination.\n\n2. **State After Switch is Closed:**\n   - When the switch is closed, bulb #4 is added in parallel with bulb #3.\n   - Now, the circuit has bulb #1 in series with the parallel combination of bulbs #2, #3, and #4.\n   - The total resistance of the parallel combination of bulbs #2, #3, and #4 will decrease because adding another bulb in parallel reduces the overall resistance.\n   - As the total resistance of the parallel combination decreases, the current through bulb #1 will increase because the voltage across it remains the same (the emf of the battery).\n\n3. **Effect on Each Bulb:**\n   - **Bulb #1:** The current through bulb #1 increases because the total current through the parallel combination increases. Therefore, bulb #1 becomes brighter.\n   - **Bulb #2:** The voltage across the parallel combination remains the same, but the current through bulb #2 will increase slightly because the total current through the parallel combination increases. Therefore, bulb #2 becomes slightly brighter.\n   - **Bulb #3:** The voltage across the parallel combination remains the same, but the current through bulb #3 will decrease slightly because some of the current now goes through bulb #4. Therefore, bulb #3 becomes slightly dimmer.\n   - **Bulb #4:** Bulb #4 is newly illuminated and will have the same voltage as bulb #3, so it will be as bright as bulb #3 was initially.\n\nBased on this analysis, the bulbs that become brighter are bulbs #1 and #2.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\\boxed{B}"
