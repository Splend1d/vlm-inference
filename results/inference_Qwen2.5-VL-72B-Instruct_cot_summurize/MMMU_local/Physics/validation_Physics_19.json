The y-intercept of this line is \\(-\\phi\\), which means that when the frequency \\( \\nu \\) is zero, the kinetic energy \\( K \\) is \\(-\\phi\\). However, since kinetic energy cannot be negative, the graph will start at the point where \\( K = 0 \\) when \\( \\nu = \\frac{\\phi}{h} \\).\n\nLet's analyze the given graphs:\n\n(A) This graph shows a straight line passing through the origin. This would imply that the kinetic energy is zero when the frequency is zero, which is not correct because the work function \\(\\phi\\) must be overcome before any photoelectrons are emitted.\n\n(B) This graph shows a straight line with a negative slope. This is incorrect because the kinetic energy increases with increasing frequency, not decreases.\n\n(C) This graph shows a curve that starts at a positive value and increases rapidly. This is not a linear relationship and does not match the photoelectric effect equation.\n\n(D) This graph shows a curve that starts at a positive value and decreases. This is also not a linear relationship and does not match the photoelectric effect equation.\n\nThe correct graph is (A), which shows a straight line starting from the origin, indicating a linear relationship between the kinetic energy and the frequency of the incident light.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is \\boxed{A}."
