                    "text": "To calculate the Z-score for Seether, LLC, we need to use the Altman Z-score formula, which is specifically designed for private companies. The formula is:\n\n\\[ Z = 1.2A + 1.4B + 3.3C + 0.6D + 1.0E \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( A = \\frac{\\text{Working Capital}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\)\n- \\( B = \\frac{\\text{Retained Earnings}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\)\n- \\( C = \\frac{\\text{EBIT}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\)\n- \\( D = \\frac{\\text{Book Value of Equity}}{\\text{Total Liabilities}} \\)\n- \\( E = \\frac{\\text{Sales}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\)\n\nHowever, since sales data is not provided in the given information, we will assume that the sales data is not required for this calculation or it is not applicable here. Therefore, we will only use the available data.\n\nLet's calculate each component:\n\n1. **A: Working Capital / Total Assets**\n   \\[ \\text{Working Capital} = \\text{Net Working Capital} = 4,200 \\]\n   \\[ A = \\frac{4,200}{73,000} \\approx 0.0575 \\]\n\n2. **B: Retained Earnings / Total Assets**\n   \\[ \\text{Retained Earnings} = 16,000 \\]\n   \\[ B = \\frac{16,000}{73,000} \\approx 0.2192 \\]\n\n3. **C: EBIT / Total Assets**\n   \\[ \\text{EBIT} = 7,900 \\]\n   \\[ C = \\frac{7,900}{73,000} \\approx 0.1082 \\]\n\n4. **D: Book Value of Equity / Total Liabilities**\n   \\[ \\text{Book Value of Equity} = 18,000 \\]\n   \\[ \\text{Total Liabilities} = 64,000 \\]\n   \\[ D = \\frac{18,000}{64,000} \\approx 0.2812 \\]\n\nNow, substitute these values into the Z-score formula:\n\n\\[ Z = 1.2(0.0575) + 1.4(0.2192) + 3.3(0.1082) + 0.6(0.2812) \\]\n\nCalculate each term:\n\n\\[ 1.2 \\times 0.0575 = 0.069 \\]\n\\[ 1.4 \\times 0.2192 = 0.30688 \\]\n\\[ 3.3 \\times 0.1082 = 0.35706 \\]\n\\[ 0.6 \\times 0.2812 = 0.16872 \\]\n\nSum these values:\n\n\\[ Z = 0.069 + 0.30688 + 0.35706 + 0.16872 \\approx 0.90166 \\]\n\nSince the calculated Z-score does not match any of the provided options, it seems there might be an error in the problem setup or additional data needed. However, based on the given data and the standard formula, the closest option would be:\n\n**B. 3.096**\n\nBut please verify the problem setup and data again."
