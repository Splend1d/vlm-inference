In this case:\n\n- Call Option: Strike Price = $60, Price = $5\n- Put Option: Strike Price = $55, Price = $4\n\nThe cost of the long strangle strategy is the sum of the premiums paid for both options:\n\\[ \\text{Cost of Long Strangle} = \\text{Price of Call Option} + \\text{Price of Put Option} = \\$5 + \\$4 = \\$9 \\]\n\nThe maximum possible loss for a long strangle occurs if the stock price at expiration is between the two strike prices ($55 and $60). In this scenario, both the call and put options will expire worthless, and the investor will lose the entire premium paid.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible loss per share for the long strangle strategy is:\n\\[ \\text{Maximum Possible Loss} = \\$9 \\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\nA. $9.00"
