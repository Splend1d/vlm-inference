Generally, higher volatility leads to a higher option price because it increases the potential for the stock price to move significantly, thereby increasing the probability that the option will end up in-the-money.\n\nGiven the data:\n\n- Both options have the same time to expiration \\( T = 0.5 \\) years.\n- Both options have the same strike price \\( X = 50 \\).\n- Both options have the same current stock price \\( S = 55 \\).\n- The risk-free interest rate is 6%.\n- No dividends are paid by the stocks.\n\nThe only difference between the two options is their prices:\n- Option A is priced at $10.\n- Option B is priced at $12.\n\nSince all other factors are identical, the higher price of Option B suggests that it must be written on the stock with higher volatility. This is because higher volatility increases the value of the option due to the increased uncertainty and potential for larger price movements.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. B"
