This means for every 10 units sold, 5 are Junior, 4 are Adult, and 1 is Expert.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total sales revenue for each type of jet ski in the composite unit:\n\n1. **Junior:**\n   - Sales Price per Unit = $50\n   - Number of Units = 5\n   - Total Sales Revenue from Junior = 5 * $50 = $250\n\n2. **Adult:**\n   - Sales Price per Unit = $75\n   - Number of Units = 4\n   - Total Sales Revenue from Adult = 4 * $75 = $300\n\n3. **Expert:**\n   - Sales Price per Unit = $110\n   - Number of Units = 1\n   - Total Sales Revenue from Expert = 1 * $110 = $110\n\nNext, we sum up the total sales revenue from all types of jet skis in the composite unit:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Sales Revenue} = \\$250 + \\$300 + \\$110 = \\$660\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the sales price per composite unit is \\(\\boxed{A}\\)."
