These costs typically include direct labor and manufacturing overhead.\n\nFrom the given data:\n- Direct labor: $25,000\n- Factory depreciation expense: $45,000 (part of manufacturing overhead)\n- Factory utilities expense: $2,000 (part of manufacturing overhead)\n\nThe payroll staff's salary ($15,000) is not part of the conversion cost as it is an administrative expense.\n\nNow, let's calculate the conversion cost:\n\n\\[ \\text{Conversion Cost} = \\text{Direct Labor} + \\text{Factory Depreciation Expense} + \\text{Factory Utilities Expense} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Conversion Cost} = \\$25,000 + \\$45,000 + \\$2,000 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Conversion Cost} = \\$72,000 \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. $72,000"
