Therefore, the fixed costs remain the same:\n\\[ \\text{Fixed costs} = \\$265,000 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Variable Costs for 800 Clients\nVariable costs change proportionally with the number of clients. First, find the variable cost per client for 500 clients:\n\\[ \\text{Variable cost per client} = \\frac{\\$180,000}{500} = \\$360 \\]\n\nNow, calculate the total variable costs for 800 clients:\n\\[ \\text{Total variable costs for 800 clients} = 800 \\times \\$360 = \\$288,000 \\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Total Costs for 800 Clients\nAdd the fixed costs and the variable costs for 800 clients:\n\\[ \\text{Total costs for 800 clients} = \\$265,000 + \\$288,000 = \\$553,000 \\]\n\n### Step 4: Verify the Options\nThe calculated total cost for 800 clients is \\$553,000. However, none of the given options match this value exactly. It seems there might be an error in the options provided or in the interpretation of the problem. \n\nGiven the options:\nA. $712,000\nB. $632,000\nC. $288,000\nD. $424,000\n\nNone of these options match our calculated value of \\$553,000. If we must choose from the given options, the closest value would be:\n\n**B. $632,000**\n\nHowever, based on the calculations, the correct total cost per 800 clients should be **\\$553,000**."
