Let's recheck the calculations:\n\n- Starting Cash Balance: $4,250\n- Cash Inflows: $6,250\n- Cash Outflows: $4,585\n\nRechecking:\nEnding Cash Balance = $4,250 + $6,250 - $4,585 = $5,915\n\nGiven the options:\nA. $6,000\nB. $6,150\nC. $6,090\nD. $6,060\n\nNone of these match $5,915. Therefore, based on the provided data and calculations, the correct answer should be:\n\n**None of the given options match the calculated ending cash balance.**"
