A 10% increase would make it:\n\\[ \\text{New Sales Price} = \\$90 + (0.10 \\times \\$90) = \\$90 + \\$9 = \\$99 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the New Contribution Margin per Unit\nThe contribution margin per unit is the difference between the sales price per unit and the variable cost per unit. The variable cost per unit remains at $40.\n\\[ \\text{New Contribution Margin per Unit} = \\$99 - \\$40 = \\$59 \\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the New Break-Even Point in Units\nThe break-even point in units is calculated by dividing the fixed costs by the contribution margin per unit.\n\\[ \\text{New Break-Even Point (Units)} = \\frac{\\text{Fixed Costs}}{\\text{New Contribution Margin per Unit}} = \\frac{\\$20,650}{\\$59} \\approx 350.00 \\text{ units} \\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the New Break-Even Point in Dollars\nThe break-even point in dollars is calculated by multiplying the break-even point in units by the new sales price per unit.\n\\[ \\text{New Break-Even Point (Dollars)} = \\text{New Break-Even Point (Units)} \\times \\text{New Sales Price per Unit} = 350 \\times \\$99 = \\$34,650 \\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe new break-even point is approximately 350 units and $34,650.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n**A. 350 units and $34,647.65**"
