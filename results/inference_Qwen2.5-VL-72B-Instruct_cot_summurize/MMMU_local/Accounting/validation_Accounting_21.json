Assuming the firm has an equal investment in each project, the average beta is:\n\\[ \\beta_{\\text{firm}} = \\frac{0.80 + 0.95 + 1.15 + 1.45}{4} = \\frac{4.35}{4} = 1.0875 \\]\n\nNow, calculate the firm's overall cost of capital:\n\\[ \\text{Cost of Capital} = 3.5\\% + 1.0875 \\times (11\\% - 3.5\\%) \\]\n\\[ \\text{Cost of Capital} = 3.5\\% + 1.0875 \\times 7.5\\% \\]\n\\[ \\text{Cost of Capital} = 3.5\\% + 8.15625\\% \\]\n\\[ \\text{Cost of Capital} = 11.65625\\% \\]\n\nNext, compare this cost of capital with each project's IRR:\n\n- Project W: IRR = 9.4% (less than 11.65625%, should be rejected)\n- Project X: IRR = 10.9% (less than 11.65625%, should be rejected)\n- Project Y: IRR = 13.0% (greater than 11.65625%, should be accepted)\n- Project Z: IRR = 14.2% (greater than 11.65625%, should be accepted)\n\nIf the firm uses its overall cost of capital as a hurdle rate, it will reject Projects W and X correctly but might incorrectly accept Project Z because its beta is higher, indicating higher risk.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\nD. No project would be incorrectly rejected; Project Z would be incorrectly accepted."
