The NPV is calculated by discounting each future cash flow back to its present value and then summing these values.\n\nThe formula for the present value (PV) of a future cash flow is:\n\\[ PV = \\frac{CF}{(1 + r)^t} \\]\nwhere \\( CF \\) is the cash flow, \\( r \\) is the discount rate, and \\( t \\) is the time period.\n\nLet's calculate the present value of each cash flow:\n\n1. Year 0: The cash flow is $9,400 (this is already in present value terms).\n   \\[ PV_0 = 9400 \\]\n\n2. Year 1: The cash flow is $-4,500.\n   \\[ PV_1 = \\frac{-4500}{(1 + 0.10)^1} = \\frac{-4500}{1.10} = -4090.91 \\]\n\n3. Year 2: The cash flow is $-3,100.\n   \\[ PV_2 = \\frac{-3100}{(1 + 0.10)^2} = \\frac{-3100}{1.21} = -2561.98 \\]\n\n4. Year 3: The cash flow is $-2,400.\n   \\[ PV_3 = \\frac{-2400}{(1 + 0.10)^3} = \\frac{-2400}{1.331} = -1803.15 \\]\n\n5. Year 4: The cash flow is $-1,800.\n   \\[ PV_4 = \\frac{-1800}{(1 + 0.10)^4} = \\frac{-1800}{1.4641} = -1229.47 \\]\n\nNow, we sum all the present values to get the NPV:\n\\[ NPV = 9400 + (-4090.91) + (-2561.98) + (-1803.15) + (-1229.47) \\]\n\\[ NPV = 9400 - 4090.91 - 2561.98 - 1803.15 - 1229.47 \\]\n\\[ NPV = 9400 - 9685.51 \\]\n\\[ NPV = -285.51 \\]\n\nSince the NPV is negative, the offer should not be accepted.\n\nThe answer is: \\boxed{B}"
