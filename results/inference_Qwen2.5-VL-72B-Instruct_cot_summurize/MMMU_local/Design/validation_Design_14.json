The style, including the use of gold backgrounds, the halos around the figures, and the specific iconography, suggests that it was created during the Byzantine period.\n\nGiven the options:\n\nA. First or second century C.E. - This is too early for this style of iconography.\nB. Sixth or seventh century C.E. - This is possible but less likely as the style seems more developed.\nC. Tenth or eleventh century C.E. - This is a very plausible time frame for this type of Byzantine icon.\nD. Fourteenth or fifteenth century C.E. - This is also possible, but the style seems more consistent with earlier Byzantine art.\n\nThe most likely answer is:\n\nC. Tenth or eleventh century C.E."
