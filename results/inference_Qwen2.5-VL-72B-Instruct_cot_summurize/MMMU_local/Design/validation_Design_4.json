Josef Albers\n\nJosef Albers was an influential artist and educator who taught at various institutions, including Black Mountain College and Yale University. He is known for his abstract geometric compositions, particularly his \"Homage to the Square\" series, which includes the image you provided. Albers also had a significant impact on art education and theory. The details about serving as a tea server in 1925, having paintings at the George Eastman Hall of RIT, and working on the wall in Gosnell are likely specific to his involvement with those institutions."
