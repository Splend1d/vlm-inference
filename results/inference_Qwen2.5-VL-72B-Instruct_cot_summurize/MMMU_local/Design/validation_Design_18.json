By sketching multiple design ideas - This is typically an earlier step in the design process, not the final resolution.\nB. By conducting user testing - While important, this is usually done during the iterative stages of design development, not as the final step.\nC. By creating a presentation and developing the design into a publishable format that addresses all evaluation criteria - This option aligns well with the final steps of resolving a design, ensuring it meets all necessary standards and is ready for publication.\nD. By refining typography and layout - This is part of the design process but not necessarily the final step in resolving a design.\n\nThe most appropriate answer is:\n\nC. By creating a presentation and developing the design into a publishable format that addresses all evaluation criteria."
