Countertop landing area\n\nIn kitchen design, it is important to have adequate countertop space around the sink for various tasks such as food preparation and cleaning. The guidelines suggest having a minimum of 24 inches of countertop space on one side of the sink and 18 inches on the other side. This space is referred to as the \"countertop landing area\" and is crucial for efficient workflow in the kitchen.\n\nThe image shows that there is a 24-inch countertop space on one side of the sink and an 18-inch countertop space on the other side, which aligns with the recommended dimensions for a countertop landing area."
