Traffic\n\nThe image shows a kitchen layout with a \"work triangle\" and a \"traffic pattern.\" The work triangle connects the stove, sink, and refrigerator, which are the primary work areas in a kitchen. The traffic pattern is indicated by the blue dotted line, which shows the flow of movement around the kitchen. It is important that no major traffic should cross through the basic work triangle to avoid interference with cooking activities and to maintain efficiency in the kitchen."
