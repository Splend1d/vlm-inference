Proximity\n\nProximity refers to the grouping of elements that are close to each other, creating a sense of unity and balance. In the context of garment design, this can be seen in how patterns, colors, or shapes are arranged to create a harmonious and balanced look. The dress in the image shows a pattern where elements are closely grouped, contributing to an overall balanced appearance."
