Blue and green are adjacent to each other on the color wheel.\n\nGiven this information, we can evaluate the options:\n\nA. **Analogous Color Scheme**: This scheme uses colors that are next to each other on the color wheel. Since blue and green are adjacent, this is a strong possibility.\n\nB. **Complementary Color Scheme**: This scheme uses colors that are opposite each other on the color wheel. Blue and green are not opposites, so this is not correct.\n\nC. **Monochromatic Color Scheme**: This scheme uses different shades and tints of a single color. The image contains two distinct colors (blue and green), so this is not correct.\n\nD. **Triadic Color Scheme**: This scheme uses three colors that are evenly spaced around the color wheel. The image only shows two colors, so this is not correct.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Analogous Color Scheme"
