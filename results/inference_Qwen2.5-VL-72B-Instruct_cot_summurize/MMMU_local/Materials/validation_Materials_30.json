                    "text": "To determine the average normal strain \\(\\varepsilon_x\\) along the x-axis, we need to analyze the deformation of the triangular plate. The plate is fixed at its base, and the apex \\(A\\) is displaced horizontally by 5 mm. This displacement causes a change in the length of the sides of the triangle.\n\nFirst, let's identify the original dimensions and the new dimensions after the displacement. The original length of each side of the equilateral triangle is 800 mm. When the apex \\(A\\) is displaced horizontally by 5 mm, the new position of the apex is \\(A'\\), which is 5 mm to the right of \\(A\\).\n\nThe original length of the side along the x-axis (from the left vertex to the right vertex) is 800 mm. After the displacement, the new length of this side can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem in the small right triangle formed by the displacement and the vertical component of the side.\n\nThe vertical component of the side remains unchanged because the displacement is purely horizontal. The new length of the side is:\n\\[ \\sqrt{(800 - 5)^2 + 0^2} = 795 \\text{ mm} \\]\n\nHowever, since the displacement is very small compared to the original length, we can approximate the new length as:\n\\[ 800 \\text{ mm} + \\frac{5 \\text{ mm}}{\\cos(45^\\circ)} = 800 \\text{ mm} + 5 \\text{ mm} \\cdot \\sqrt{2} \\approx 800 \\text{ mm} + 7.07 \\text{ mm} = 807.07 \\text{ mm} \\]\n\nThe change in length \\(\\Delta L\\) is:\n\\[ \\Delta L = 807.07 \\text{ mm} - 800 \\text{ mm} = 7.07 \\text{ mm} \\]\n\nThe average normal strain \\(\\varepsilon_x\\) is given by the ratio of the change in length to the original length:\n\\[ \\varepsilon_x = \\frac{\\Delta L}{L} = \\frac{7.07 \\text{ mm}}{800 \\text{ mm}} = 0.00884 \\text{ mm/mm} \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{0.00884 \\text{ mm/mm}} \\]"
