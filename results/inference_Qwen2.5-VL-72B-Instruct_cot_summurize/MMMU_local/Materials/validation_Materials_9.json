                    "text": "To determine the average shear stress developed in the 6-mm diameter pin B, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the moment about point D:**\n   The force \\( P = 1500 \\) N is applied at point A, which is 450 mm from point D. The moment about point D due to this force is:\n   \\[\n   M_D = P \\times 450 \\text{ mm} = 1500 \\text{ N} \\times 0.45 \\text{ m} = 675 \\text{ Nm}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the force in the link BC:**\n   The link BC is connected to the bell crank at point C and is 300 mm from point D. The angle between the link BC and the horizontal is 45\u00b0. The force in the link BC can be found by equating the moment about point D due to the force in the link BC to the moment due to the force P.\n   \\[\n   F_{BC} \\times 300 \\text{ mm} \\times \\sin(45^\\circ) = 675 \\text{ Nm}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   F_{BC} \\times 0.3 \\text{ m} \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} = 675 \\text{ Nm}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   F_{BC} \\times 0.3 \\times 0.707 = 675\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   F_{BC} \\times 0.2121 = 675\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   F_{BC} = \\frac{675}{0.2121} \\approx 3182.4 \\text{ N}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the shear force in the pin B:**\n   Since the pin B is subjected to double shear, the shear force in each section of the pin is half of the force in the link BC.\n   \\[\n   F_{shear} = \\frac{F_{BC}}{2} = \\frac{3182.4}{2} = 1591.2 \\text{ N}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the cross-sectional area of the pin B:**\n   The diameter of the pin B is 6 mm, so the radius is 3 mm or 0.003 m. The cross-sectional area of the pin is:\n   \\[\n   A = \\pi r^2 = \\pi (0.003)^2 = \\pi \\times 0.000009 = 2.827 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ m}^2\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the average shear stress in the pin B:**\n   The average shear stress is given by the shear force divided by the cross-sectional area.\n   \\[\n   \\tau = \\frac{F_{shear}}{A} = \\frac{1591.2}{2.827 \\times 10^{-5}} \\approx 56280 \\text{ Pa} = 56.28 \\text{ MPa}\n   \\]\n\nSince the closest option to 56.28 MPa is 60.5 MPa, the correct answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{60.5 \\text{ MPa}}\n\\]"
