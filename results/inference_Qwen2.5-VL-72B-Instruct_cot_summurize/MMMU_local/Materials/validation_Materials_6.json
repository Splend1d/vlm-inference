For the direction \\((3, 2, 6)\\), the Miller indices are \\([3, 2, 6]\\).\n\n5. **Check if the direction is in the opposite direction:**\n   - If the direction is in the opposite direction, the indices will be negative. In this case, the direction is not in the opposite direction, so the indices remain positive.\n\nHowever, the problem asks for the indices of the direction represented by the vector, and the options provided are all negative. This suggests that the direction might be considered in the opposite direction.\n\n6. **Consider the opposite direction:**\n   - The opposite direction of \\((3, 2, 6)\\) is \\((-3, -2, -6)\\).\n\n7. **Simplify the indices:**\n   - Simplify \\((-3, -2, -6)\\) by dividing by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 1, which does not change the indices.\n\nThus, the correct indices for the direction represented by the vector are \\([-3, -2, -6]\\).\n\nGiven the options, the closest match is:\n\n**A. [-321]**\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is \\(\\boxed{A}\\)."
