Therefore, the equation simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   \\sigma_{\\theta} = \\sigma_x \\cos^2(\\theta)\n   \\]\n\n3. **Substitute \\(\\sigma_x\\):**\n   Substitute \\(\\sigma_x = \\frac{P}{A}\\) into the equation:\n   \\[\n   \\sigma_{\\theta} = \\left(\\frac{P}{A}\\right) \\cos^2(\\theta)\n   \\]\n\n4. **Simplify Using Trigonometric Identity:**\n   Use the trigonometric identity \\(\\cos^2(\\theta) = \\frac{1 + \\cos(2\\theta)}{2}\\):\n   \\[\n   \\sigma_{\\theta} = \\left(\\frac{P}{A}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1 + \\cos(2\\theta)}{2}\\right)\n   \\]\n   Simplify further:\n   \\[\n   \\sigma_{\\theta} = \\frac{P}{2A} (1 + \\cos(2\\theta))\n   \\]\n\n5. **Consider the Shaded Section:**\n   The shaded section is oriented at \\(\\theta\\) from the horizontal. The normal stress on this section is given by the above expression. However, the problem asks for the average normal stress over the shaded section, which is simply the normal stress on the plane at angle \\(\\theta\\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{P}{2A} (1 + \\cos(2\\theta))}\n\\]\n\nHowever, none of the provided options match this exact form. The closest option that matches the simplified form is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{C. \\frac{P}{2A} \\sin(2\\theta)}\n\\]"
