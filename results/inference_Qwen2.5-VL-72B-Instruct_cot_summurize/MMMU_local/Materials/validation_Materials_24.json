However, the specific distances given can help us distinguish between these.\n\n2. **Analyze the distances:**\n   - The distance between two adjacent atoms along one direction is \\(a\\sqrt{2}\\).\n   - The distance between two atoms along another direction is \\(a\\sqrt{3}\\).\n\n3. **Compare with known lattice parameters:**\n   - For an FCC lattice, the distance between two adjacent atoms along the [100] direction is \\(a\\), along the [110] direction is \\(a\\sqrt{2}\\), and along the [111] direction is \\(a\\sqrt{3}/2\\).\n   - For a BCC lattice, the distance between two adjacent atoms along the [100] direction is \\(a\\sqrt{3}/2\\), along the [110] direction is \\(a\\sqrt{6}/2\\), and along the [111] direction is \\(a\\sqrt{3}\\).\n\n4. **Match the distances:**\n   - The distance \\(a\\sqrt{2}\\) matches the [110] direction in an FCC lattice.\n   - The distance \\(a\\sqrt{3}\\) matches the [111] direction in an FCC lattice.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The unit cell plane depicted in the image is consistent with the [110] plane of an FCC lattice.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is \\(\\boxed{\\text{F}}\\)."
