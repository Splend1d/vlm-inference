                    "text": "To determine the shear strain \\(\\gamma_{xy}\\) at the corner B, we need to analyze the deformation of the plastic piece. Shear strain \\(\\gamma_{xy}\\) is defined as the change in angle between two originally perpendicular lines. In this case, we will consider the change in angle between the vertical and horizontal lines passing through point B.\n\nFrom the figure, we can see that the original right angle at point B has been distorted. The new angle between the vertical and horizontal lines can be found by considering the displacements of points B and C.\n\nThe vertical displacement of point B is 4 mm, and the horizontal displacement of point B is 5 mm. The original length of the side adjacent to point B is 300 mm (vertical) and 400 mm (horizontal).\n\nThe shear strain \\(\\gamma_{xy}\\) can be approximated by the ratio of the displacement to the original length of the side. Specifically, it is the sum of the horizontal displacement divided by the vertical length and the vertical displacement divided by the horizontal length:\n\n\\[\n\\gamma_{xy} = \\frac{\\text{horizontal displacement}}{\\text{vertical length}} + \\frac{\\text{vertical displacement}}{\\text{horizontal length}}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n\\[\n\\gamma_{xy} = \\frac{5 \\text{ mm}}{300 \\text{ mm}} + \\frac{4 \\text{ mm}}{400 \\text{ mm}} = \\frac{5}{300} + \\frac{4}{400} = \\frac{1}{60} + \\frac{1}{100}\n\\]\n\nTo add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 60 and 100 is 300:\n\n\\[\n\\gamma_{xy} = \\frac{5}{300} + \\frac{3}{300} = \\frac{8}{300} = \\frac{4}{150} = \\frac{2}{75} \\approx 0.0267 \\text{ rad}\n\\]\n\nConverting this to scientific notation:\n\n\\[\n\\gamma_{xy} \\approx 2.67 \\times 10^{-2} \\text{ rad}\n\\]\n\nHowever, the closest option to this value is:\n\n\\[\n\\gamma_{xy} \\approx 11.6 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ rad}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n\\boxed{A}"
