This distance is the sum of the vertical distances from A to B and from B to D.\n   - The vertical distance from A to B remains 400 mm (since the horizontal sides AB and CD remain unchanged).\n   - The vertical distance from B to D is the difference in the y-coordinates of points B and D after deformation. From the figure, we can see that point D has moved up by 3 mm.\n   Therefore, the new length of AD is \\(400 \\text{ mm} + 3 \\text{ mm} = 403 \\text{ mm}\\).\n\n3. **Calculate the change in length of AD:**\n   The change in length of AD is the new length minus the original length:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta L_{AD} = 403 \\text{ mm} - 400 \\text{ mm} = 3 \\text{ mm}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the average normal strain along AD:**\n   The average normal strain is given by the ratio of the change in length to the original length:\n   \\[\n   \\epsilon_{AD} = \\frac{\\Delta L_{AD}}{L_{AD}} = \\frac{3 \\text{ mm}}{400 \\text{ mm}} = 0.0075 \\text{ mm/mm}\n   \\]\n\nHowever, the closest option to this value is 0.00680 mm/mm, which suggests a possible rounding or approximation in the problem's context.
