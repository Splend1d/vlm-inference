The Hall-Petch relationship states that the yield stress (\\(\\sigma_y\\)) of a polycrystalline material is inversely proportional to the square root of the average grain size (\\(d\\)):\n\n\\[\n\\sigma_y = \\sigma_0 + k_d d^{-1/2}\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(\\sigma_0\\) is the friction stress,\n- \\(k_d\\) is the Hall-Petch constant,\n- \\(d\\) is the average grain size.\n\nFrom this relationship, it is clear that as the grain size decreases, the yield stress increases. Conversely, larger grain sizes result in lower yield stresses.\n\nNow, let's analyze the provided images:\n\n- **Image (a)**: This image shows the largest grain sizes among the four.\n- **Image (b)**: This image shows smaller grain sizes compared to (a), but still relatively large.\n- **Image (c)**: This image shows even smaller grain sizes than (b).\n- **Image (d)**: This image shows the smallest grain sizes among the four.\n\nGiven the Hall-Petch relationship, the structure with the largest grain sizes will have the lowest yield stress. Therefore, the structure in **Image (a)** is expected to provide the lowest yield stress.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n**A. Image (a)**"
