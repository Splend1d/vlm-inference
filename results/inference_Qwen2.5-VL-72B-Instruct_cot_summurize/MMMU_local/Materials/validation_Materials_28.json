                    "text": "To determine which schematic correctly depicts the phenomenon of dispersion within the glass, we need to understand the behavior of light as it passes through a medium like borosilicate glass. Dispersion occurs because different wavelengths (or colors) of light travel at different speeds in the same medium, leading to a change in their refractive indices.\n\nHere are the key points to consider:\n\n1. **Refractive Index and Wavelength**: The refractive index \\( n \\) of a material depends on the wavelength \\( \\lambda \\) of the light. Typically, the refractive index increases as the wavelength decreases. This means that blue light (shorter wavelength) has a higher refractive index than red light (longer wavelength).\n\n2. **Path Length in the Medium**: Due to the higher refractive index for shorter wavelengths, blue light will bend more than red light when entering the glass from vacuum. This results in a greater angle of refraction for blue light compared to red light.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\n- **Option A**: Shows green and red light with no blue light. Green light is shown bending more than red light, which is incorrect since blue light should bend more than both green and red light.\n  \n- **Option B**: Shows blue, red, and green light. Blue light is shown bending more than red light, which is correct. However, green light is shown bending less than red light, which is incorrect.\n\n- **Option C**: Shows green and red light with no blue light. Green light is shown bending more than red light, which is incorrect since blue light should bend more than both green and red light.\n\n- **Option D**: Shows green and blue light with no red light. Both green and blue light are shown bending, but there is no red light for comparison. Additionally, the paths do not clearly show the expected difference in bending between green and blue light.\n\nGiven these analyses, none of the options correctly depict the phenomenon of dispersion with all the necessary details. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**E. None of the options are qualitatively correct.**"
