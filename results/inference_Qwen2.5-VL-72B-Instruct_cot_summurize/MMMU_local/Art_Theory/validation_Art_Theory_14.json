Mannerism emerged in the late 16th century as a reaction to the balanced compositions and idealized forms of the High Renaissance. The figures in this painting exhibit exaggerated proportions and complex, often contorted postures, which are typical of Mannerist art.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Mannerist"
