The image shows an abstract, geometric sculpture with a metallic finish, which is characteristic of modernist art.\n\n- **1910's**: This period was marked by early modernist movements like Cubism, but the materials and techniques shown in the image do not align with that era.\n- **1940's**: Abstract art continued to evolve, but the specific style and finish seen here are more indicative of later periods.\n- **1960's**: This decade saw a significant rise in abstract and minimalist art, with a focus on industrial materials and geometric forms. The metallic finish and the abstract composition are consistent with works from this period.\n- **1990's**: While contemporary art often includes similar elements, the style and finish suggest an earlier period within the 20th century.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most likely decade for this work is the **1960's**.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\nC. 1960's"
