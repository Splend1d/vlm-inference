The central figure appears to be Christ in Majesty, a common theme in medieval art. The figures are depicted in a somewhat rigid and stylized manner, with less emphasis on naturalism and more on symbolic representation.\n\n2. **Details and Ornamentation**: The figures are adorned with detailed drapery and there is a sense of hierarchy in the composition, with the central figure being the most prominent. The smaller figures around the central figure are arranged in a structured manner, which is characteristic of Romanesque art.\n\n3. **Historical Context**: The Romanesque period (approximately 1000-1200 AD) is known for its use of tympana above doorways in churches, often depicting Christ in Majesty. The style is characterized by its heavy, solid forms and a lack of deep perspective, which matches the features seen in the image.\n\nGiven these observations, the work can be attributed to the Romanesque period.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nB. Romanesque"
