While this painting does have emotional intensity, it lacks the specific stylistic elements typical of Baroque art.\n   \n2. **Realism**: This movement (mid-19th century) focused on depicting subjects as they truly appeared, often focusing on everyday life and social issues. The painting, however, uses idealized figures and symbolic elements that go beyond mere realism.\n\n3. **Romanticism**: This period (late 18th to mid-19th century) emphasized emotion, individualism, and the glorification of nature and history. The painting features a highly emotional and symbolic representation of liberty, with dynamic composition and vibrant colors, all hallmarks of Romanticism.\n\n4. **Impressionism**: This movement (late 19th century) focused on capturing the fleeting effects of light and color, often with visible brushstrokes and an emphasis on outdoor scenes. The painting does not exhibit these characteristics.\n\n### Final Answer:\nC. Romanticism"
