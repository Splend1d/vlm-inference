This is not evident in the image.\n\n2. **Atmospheric Perspective (Option B)**: This is a technique used to create depth by making distant objects less distinct and lighter in color compared to closer objects. The image does show some depth with the trees and figures, but it is not a prominent feature.\n\n3. **Di sotto in s\u00f9 (Option C)**: This is an Italian term meaning \"from below upwards,\" referring to a painting technique where the subject is viewed from a low angle, looking up. The image does not appear to be painted from a low angle.\n\n4. **Tenebrism (Option D)**: This is a painting style characterized by the use of dramatic contrasts between light and dark, often creating a sense of drama and intensity. The image does not show strong contrasts of light and dark.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most fitting option is **B. Atmospheric Perspective**. The image does show some depth and layering that suggests the use of atmospheric perspective to create a sense of space.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nB. Atmospheric Perspective"
