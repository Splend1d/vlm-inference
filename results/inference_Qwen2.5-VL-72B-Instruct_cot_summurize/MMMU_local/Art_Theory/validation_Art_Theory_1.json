These sculptures were used to honor important figures in Kuba society, such as chiefs or other significant individuals.\n\n**Image 2:** This image depicts a traditional ceremony, possibly involving a chief or an important figure, surrounded by people and ceremonial objects. The attire and setting suggest a continuation of cultural practices.\n\nGiven this context:\n\n- **Option A:** There is no evidence in the images to suggest that the tradition disappeared with British occupation.\n- **Option B:** The second image suggests that similar traditions are still being practiced, indicating that the tradition is still active today.\n- **Option C:** While it is possible that some traditions may have evolved, there is no clear indication from the images that the original meaning has been lost.\n- **Option D:** The images do not provide enough information to conclude that the tradition is celebrated throughout Africa and wherever Africans have traveled.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most appropriate answer is:\n\n**B. is still active today**"
