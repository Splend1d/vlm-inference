The cross-section in Image 2 further supports this by showing a high central aisle (nave) flanked by lower side aisles, a feature typical of basilica architecture. Basilicas were originally Roman public buildings used for various civic purposes but were later adopted by the Christian Church for worship, leading to the development of the basilica-style church."
