Let's analyze each option:\n\nA. The Great Stupa at Sanchi: This is a large hemispherical dome built over the relics of Buddha. It does not have a spiral design and is not an earthwork.\n\nB. The Serpent Mound in Ohio: This is a prehistoric effigy mound located in Adams County, Ohio. It is a large, undulating earthwork in the shape of a serpent, which shares some visual similarities with the spiral structure in the image.\n\nC. Machu Picchu in Peru: This is an Incan city high in the Andes Mountains. It is known for its stone architecture and terraces but does not feature a spiral design.\n\nD. The ruins of the city of Pompeii: These are the remains of an ancient Roman city destroyed by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius. The ruins consist of buildings and streets but do not include a spiral earthwork.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most appropriate answer is:\n\nB. the Serpent Mound in Ohio"
