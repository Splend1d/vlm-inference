Instead, it appears to be a classical or mythological scene, possibly depicting a goddess or queen being transported by a group of figures, which could be interpreted as allegorical or symbolic.\n\nHowever, to answer the question about Stonehenge:\n\nStonehenge is a prehistoric monument in England consisting of a ring of standing stones. The use of stone in such structures like Stonehenge illustrates an architectural tradition that:\n\nA. employed a mortise and tenon system for supporting lintels - This is correct. Stonehenge features large horizontal stones (lintels) supported by vertical stones (posts), and these were often secured using a mortise and tenon joint system, where a projection on one piece fits into a cavity on another.\n\nSo, the correct answer is A."
