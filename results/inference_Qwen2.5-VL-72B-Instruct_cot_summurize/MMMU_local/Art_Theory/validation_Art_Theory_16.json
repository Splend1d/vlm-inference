The layout shows a large central space with smaller rooms or areas surrounding it. There are no clear indications of a vaulted ceiling, pedimental recesses, or radiating chapels in this floor plan. However, the central open area could suggest an atrium.\n\n**Image 2:** This is a cross-sectional view of the building. It shows a large central space with a high roof supported by columns. The roof structure does not appear to be vaulted but rather has a series of beams and supports. There are no visible pedimental recesses or radiating chapels. The central open space under the roof is consistent with an atrium.\n\nGiven the analysis of both images, the most accurate description of the building is that it had:\n\nD. an atrium\n\nThe central open space in both the floor plan and the cross-sectional view strongly suggests the presence of an atrium."
