Let's analyze each option to determine what is not exhibited in the painting:\n\nA. **Hierarchical scale**: This refers to the technique where important figures are depicted larger than others to emphasize their importance. In \"The Raft of the Medusa,\" there is no clear hierarchical scale; all figures are relatively similar in size, emphasizing the collective suffering rather than individual importance.\n\nB. **Graphic representation of horror and despair**: The painting vividly portrays the horror and despair of the survivors on the raft, with detailed expressions and postures that convey their suffering.\n\nC. **A sense of immediacy and drama**: The painting captures a moment of intense drama and urgency, with the figures actively engaged in a desperate attempt to signal for help.\n\nD. **Use of sharply contrasting light and shade**: The painting uses chiaroscuro (sharp contrasts between light and dark) to create depth and focus attention on the central figures.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nA. hierarchical scale"
