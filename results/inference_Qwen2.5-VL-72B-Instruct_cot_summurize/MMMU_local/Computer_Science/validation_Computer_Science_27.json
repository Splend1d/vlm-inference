This results in high bias and low variance.\n- In the context of SVM, underfitting can be identified if the decision boundary is too simplistic and does not separate the classes well.\n\n### Parameters in SVM with Gaussian Kernel:\n- **\\( C \\)**: The regularization parameter. A smaller \\( C \\) means more regularization, leading to a wider margin but potentially more misclassifications. A larger \\( C \\) means less regularization, allowing the model to fit the training data better but risking overfitting.\n- **\\( \\sigma^2 \\)**: The variance of the Gaussian kernel. A larger \\( \\sigma^2 \\) makes the kernel smoother, leading to a simpler decision boundary. A smaller \\( \\sigma^2 \\) makes the kernel more sensitive to individual data points, leading to a more complex decision boundary.\n\n### Analyzing the Decision Boundary:\n- The decision boundary in the image appears to be quite linear and simplistic, suggesting that the model might be underfitting the data.\n\n### Adjusting Parameters:\n1. **Increasing \\( C \\)**: This will reduce the regularization, allowing the model to fit the training data better and potentially capturing more complex patterns.\n2. **Decreasing \\( \\sigma^2 \\)**: This will make the Gaussian kernel more sensitive to individual data points, leading to a more complex decision boundary that can better separate the classes.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven that the SVM is suspected to be underfitting, we should try to make the model more complex by:\n- Increasing \\( C \\) to reduce regularization.\n- Decreasing \\( \\sigma^2 \\) to make the kernel more sensitive.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is:\n\n**C. It would be reasonable to try increasing \\( C \\). It would also be reasonable to try decreasing \\( \\sigma^2 \\).**"
