A leftist heap is a binary tree where each node has a value greater than or equal to its children, and it satisfies the leftist property: the rank of the left child is always greater than or equal to the rank of the right child.\n\nGiven the leftist heap:\n\n```\n        6\n       / \\\n     13   8\n    / \\   / \\\n   18  24 12 37\n      / \\ / \\\n     35 17 19\n    /\n   26\n```\n\nWe need to delete the minimum number, which is the root (6). After deleting the root, we need to restructure the heap by merging the two subtrees rooted at 13 and 8.\n\nLet's analyze the options after deleting the root:\n\nA. 8 is NOT the root\n- After deleting the root, the new root will be the smaller of the roots of the two subtrees, which is 8. So, this statement is false.\n\nB. 12 is the right child of 8\n- After merging the two subtrees, 12 will be the right child of 8 because 12 is less than 37 and the leftist property must be maintained. So, this statement is true.\n\nC. 24 is the left child of 13\n- In the original heap, 24 is the right child of 13. After restructuring, 24 will still be the right child of 13 because it is greater than 18. So, this statement is false.\n\nD. 35 is the right child of 24\n- In the original heap, 35 is the left child of 24. After restructuring, 35 will still be the left child of 24 because it is less than 17. So, this statement is false.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n\\boxed{B}"
