A DFA is minimal if and only if all its states are distinguishable.\n\nLet's analyze the states step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the states and their transitions:**\n   - \\( G_1 \\): Start state\n   - \\( G_6 \\): Transition from \\( G_1 \\) on 'a'\n   - \\( G_7 \\): Transition from \\( G_6 \\) on 'b'\n   - \\( G_4 \\): Transition from \\( G_7 \\) on 'a'\n   - \\( G_5 \\): Transition from \\( G_6 \\) on 'a'\n\n2. **Check for indistinguishable states:**\n   - States \\( G_6 \\) and \\( G_5 \\):\n     - Both have transitions on 'a' leading to different states (\\( G_6 \\) goes to \\( G_5 \\) and \\( G_5 \\) goes to \\( G_6 \\)).\n     - Both have transitions on 'b' leading to \\( G_7 \\).\n     - Since they have the same transitions on both 'a' and 'b', they are indistinguishable.\n\n3. **Merge indistinguishable states:**\n   - Merge \\( G_6 \\) and \\( G_5 \\) into a single state, say \\( G_{65} \\).\n\n4. **Update the DFA with the merged state:**\n   - The new DFA will have states \\( G_1 \\), \\( G_{65} \\), \\( G_7 \\), and \\( G_4 \\).\n   - Transitions:\n     - \\( G_1 \\) on 'a' goes to \\( G_{65} \\)\n     - \\( G_{65} \\) on 'a' goes to \\( G_{65} \\)\n     - \\( G_{65} \\) on 'b' goes to \\( G_7 \\)\n     - \\( G_7 \\) on 'a' goes to \\( G_4 \\)\n     - \\( G_7 \\) on 'b' goes to \\( G_{65} \\)\n\nSince we were able to merge states \\( G_6 \\) and \\( G_5 \\) without changing the language accepted by the DFA, the original DFA is not minimal.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{B}\n\\]"
