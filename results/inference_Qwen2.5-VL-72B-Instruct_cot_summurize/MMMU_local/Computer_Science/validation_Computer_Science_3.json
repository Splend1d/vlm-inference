It does not handle the movement of data across the network.\n- **Transport Layer**: This layer ensures reliable end-to-end communication and manages data transfer between hosts. While it does deal with data transfer, it primarily focuses on ensuring the data is delivered correctly and reliably, rather than routing it across the network.\n- **Network Layer**: This layer is responsible for routing packets (datagrams) from the source host to the destination host. It determines the path that the data should take through the network.\n- **Link Layer**: This layer handles the physical transmission of data over a link or segment of the network. It deals with the direct connection between two devices.\n- **Physical Layer**: This layer deals with the physical transmission of bits over the network medium.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Network Layer"
