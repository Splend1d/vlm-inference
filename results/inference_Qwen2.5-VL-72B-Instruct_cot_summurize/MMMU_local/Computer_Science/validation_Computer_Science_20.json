However, typically in such database designs, the `Mgr_ssn` is often made non-nullable to ensure every department has a manager.\n\nGiven this analysis:\n\n- If `Mgr_ssn` is non-nullable: You cannot add a DEPARTMENT without an EMPLOYEE.\n- If `Mgr_ssn` is nullable: You can add a DEPARTMENT without an EMPLOYEE by setting `Mgr_ssn` to NULL.\n\nSince the image does not provide explicit information about the nullability of `Mgr_ssn`, the most accurate answer is:\n\nC. Can't tell\n\nThe correct answer is C. Can't tell."
