The time stamps help us understand the order in which nodes were visited during the DFS traversal.\n\nHere are the steps to identify the correct depth-first forest:\n\n1. **Identify the connected components based on the time stamps:**\n   - Nodes with consecutive discovery and finishing time stamps that do not overlap with other nodes' time stamps belong to the same connected component.\n\n2. **Analyze each node's time stamps:**\n   - Node `a`: Discovery time = 13, Finishing time = 14\n   - Node `b`: Discovery time = 11, Finishing time = 16\n   - Node `e`: Discovery time = 12, Finishing time = 15\n   - Node `f`: Discovery time = 3, Finishing time = 4\n   - Node `g`: Discovery time = 5, Finishing time = 7\n   - Node `c`: Discovery time = 1, Finishing time = 10\n   - Node `d`: Discovery time = 8, Finishing time = 9\n   - Node `h`: Discovery time = 2, Finishing time = 6\n\n3. **Group nodes based on their time stamps:**\n   - Nodes `a`, `b`, and `e` have overlapping time stamps (11-16, 12-15, 13-14), indicating they are part of the same connected component.\n   - Nodes `f` and `g` have consecutive time stamps (3-4, 5-7), indicating they are part of the same connected component.\n   - Nodes `c` and `d` have consecutive time stamps (1-10, 8-9), indicating they are part of the same connected component.\n   - Node `h` has its own time stamps (2-6), indicating it is part of a separate connected component.\n\n4. **Verify the options:**\n   - Option A: `{a, b, e} {c, d, h} {f, g}` - Incorrect because `h` should be a separate component.\n   - Option B: `{a, b, e} {f, g} {c, d} {h}` - Correct as it matches the identified components.\n   - Option C: `{a, b, e} {f, g} {c, d} {h}` - Same as Option B, correct.\n   - Option D: `{a, b, e} {c, d, f, g, h}` - Incorrect because `f`, `g`, `c`, `d`, and `h` are not all in the same component.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. {a, b, e} {f, g} {c, d} {h}**"
