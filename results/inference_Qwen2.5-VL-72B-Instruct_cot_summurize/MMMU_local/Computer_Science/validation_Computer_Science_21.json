Normal traversal of the matrix: This typically means visiting elements row by row or column by column in a straightforward manner, which is not what is shown here.\n\nB. Row-wise traversal of the matrix: This means visiting all elements in the first row, then the second row, and so on. The given traversal does not follow this pattern.\n\nC. Column-wise traversal of the matrix: This means visiting all elements in the first column, then the second column, and so on. The given traversal does not follow this pattern either.\n\nD. Spiral traversal of the matrix: This means starting from the top-left corner and moving in a spiral pattern, which matches the traversal shown in the image.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n\\boxed{D}"
