                    "text": "To determine which coefficient will become zero first as the regularization parameter \\( C \\) increases, we need to understand how L1 regularization works in logistic regression.\n\n### Understanding L1 Regularization:\nL1 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the absolute values of the coefficients (\\(|w_1|\\) and \\(|w_2|\\)). The objective function with L1 regularization can be written as:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\log P(y_i | x_i, w_0, w_1, w_2) - C (|w_1| + |w_2|)\n\\]\n\nThe term \\( C (|w_1| + |w_2|) \\) penalizes the model for having non-zero coefficients. As \\( C \\) increases, this penalty becomes stronger, pushing the coefficients towards zero.\n\n### Impact on Coefficients:\n- **Smaller Coefficients First:** The coefficients that have smaller magnitudes will be driven to zero first because they contribute less to the model's predictive power but still incur a penalty.\n- **Feature Importance:** In the context of the provided data, we need to assess the relative importance of \\( x_1 \\) and \\( x_2 \\) in separating the two classes.\n\n### Analyzing the Data:\nFrom the scatter plots:\n- The '+' and 'o' points are separated primarily along the \\( x_1 \\) axis.\n- There is no clear separation along the \\( x_2 \\) axis; the points are more mixed.\n\nThis suggests that \\( x_1 \\) is more important for classification than \\( x_2 \\).\n\n### Conclusion:\nAs \\( C \\) increases:\n1. The less important feature (\\( x_2 \\)) will have its coefficient (\\( w_2 \\)) driven to zero first because it contributes less to the separation.\n2. If \\( C \\) continues to increase, eventually \\( w_1 \\) will also be driven to zero.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**A. First, \\( w_2 \\) becomes zero, and then \\( w_1 \\) becomes zero.**"
