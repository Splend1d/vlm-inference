The BST property states that for any node, all nodes in its left subtree have values less than the node's value, and all nodes in its right subtree have values greater than the node's value.\n\nLet's analyze each tree:\n\n### Tree A:\n```\n      5\n     / \\\n    3   7\n   / \\ / \\\n  2  4 6  8\n```\nThis tree is already a valid BST because it satisfies the BST property at every node. For example, the root node 5 has 3 and 7 as its children, with 3 being less than 5 and 7 being greater than 5. Similarly, the left child of 5 (node 3) has 2 and 4 as its children, with 2 being less than 3 and 4 being greater than 3. The same applies to the right child of 5 (node 7).\n\n### Tree B:\n```\n      5\n     / \\\n    3   7\n   / \\ / \\\n  2  6 4  8\n```\nThis tree is not a valid BST because the node 6 is in the left subtree of node 3, but 6 is greater than 3, violating the BST property.\n\n### Tree C:\n```\n      5\n     / \\\n    3   7\n   / \\ / \\\n  2  4 8  6\n```\nThis tree is not a valid BST because the node 8 is in the left subtree of node 7, but 8 is greater than 7, violating the BST property.\n\n### Tree D:\n```\n      5\n     / \\\n    3   7\n   / \\ / \\\n  2  4 6  8\n```\nThis tree is already a valid BST because it satisfies the BST property at every node. It is identical to Tree A.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n\\boxed{A}"
