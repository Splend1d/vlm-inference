Check the cardinality: The cardinality for the \"OFFERS\" relationship is (1,1) on the DEPT side and (0,N) on the COURSE side.\n\nThe cardinality (1,1) on the DEPT side means that each DEPT can offer one or more courses, but each COURSE can only be offered by exactly one DEPT.\n\nTherefore, a COURSE can be offered by exactly one DEPT.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nB. 1"
