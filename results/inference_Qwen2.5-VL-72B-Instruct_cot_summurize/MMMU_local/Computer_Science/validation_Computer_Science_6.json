This gap narrows as the training set size increases but does not close completely.\n\n### Interpretation:\n- **High Bias**: If the algorithm had high bias, both the training error and the test error would be high and would converge to similar values as the training set size increases. However, in this case, the training error is relatively low, indicating that the model can fit the training data well.\n- **High Variance**: The significant gap between the training error and the test error suggests that the model is overfitting to the training data and does not generalize well to the test data. This is a characteristic of high variance.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe algorithm is suffering from **high variance** because the test error is significantly higher than the training error, indicating poor generalization.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. High variance**"
