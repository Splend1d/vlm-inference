The lines \"Hold onto dreams\" and \"Hold fast to dreams\" directly advise the reader to keep their dreams close. The poem also describes what life would be like without dreams, using metaphors such as a \"broken-winged bird that cannot fly\" and a \"barren field frozen with snow.\"\n\nGiven these points, the option that best relates to the poem is:\n\nC. Keep hold of your dream."
