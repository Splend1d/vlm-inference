The would-be-thief was motivated by blue suede shoes.\n\nIn the story, Roger attempts to steal the purse because he wants money to buy a pair of blue suede shoes. The woman, Mrs. Luella Bates Washington Jones, recognizes his desire and decides to help him understand the consequences of his actions through kindness rather than punishment."
