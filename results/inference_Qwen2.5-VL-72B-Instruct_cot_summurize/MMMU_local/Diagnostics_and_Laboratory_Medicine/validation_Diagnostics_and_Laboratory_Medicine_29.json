The image does not suggest any such findings, so this can be ruled out.\n   \n2. **Liver Cancer (Option B)**: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is common in patients with cirrhosis. HCC often appears as a hypodense lesion on non-enhanced CT and may show enhancement in the arterial phase followed by washout in the portal venous phase. However, some HCCs may not enhance significantly in the arterial phase, especially if they are hypovascular.\n\n3. **Liver Abscess (Option C)**: A liver abscess typically presents as a well-defined, round lesion with a rim enhancement and central necrosis. The absence of significant enhancement and the clinical history of cirrhosis make this less likely.\n\n4. **Liver Adenoma (Option D)**: Liver adenomas are usually seen in younger patients, particularly women taking oral contraceptives. They are less common in older men with cirrhosis and typically show more significant enhancement in the arterial phase.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the patient's history of liver cirrhosis and the appearance of the lesion on the CT scan, the most likely diagnosis is:\n\n**B. Liver cancer**\n\nThis aligns with the high risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with cirrhosis and the imaging characteristics observed. Further confirmation might require additional imaging phases or biopsy."
