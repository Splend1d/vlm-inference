PSP also shows significant iron deposition in the midbrain.\n\n3. **Key Features in the Image**:\n   - The significant darkening in the midbrain on the T1-weighted image is highly suggestive of iron deposition.\n   - The overall shape and structure of the midbrain in the T2-weighted image do not show the classic \"hummingbird sign,\" which is more specific to PSP.\n\nGiven these observations, the most likely diagnosis is:\n\n**B. Progressive supranuclear palsy**\n\nHowever, since the image does not definitively show the \"hummingbird sign,\" and iron deposition can be seen in both conditions, the safest answer considering the options provided would be:\n\n**C. Either of the above**\n\nThis acknowledges the possibility of either condition based on the visible iron deposition."
