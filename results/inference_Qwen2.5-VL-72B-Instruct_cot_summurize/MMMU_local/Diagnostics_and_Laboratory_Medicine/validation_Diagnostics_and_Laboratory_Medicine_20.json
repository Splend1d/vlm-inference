Given the patient's background as a 45-year-old Mexican rancher and the 3-month history of cognitive problems, the most likely etiology of this process is:\n\n**A. Cysticercosis**\n\n### Reasoning:\n- **Cysticercosis**: This is caused by the larval form of the tapeworm *Taenia solium*. It is common in regions where there is poor sanitation and where people consume undercooked pork. The larvae can migrate to the brain and form cysts, leading to neurocysticercosis. The histological appearance often shows a cystic structure with surrounding inflammation, which matches the image.\n  \n- **Amebic encephalitis**: Typically caused by *Naegleria fowleri* and is more acute, usually presenting within days to weeks with severe symptoms. It is less likely given the chronic presentation.\n\n- **Herpes Simplex encephalitis**: Usually presents acutely with fever, headache, and altered mental status. Histologically, it shows necrosis and viral inclusions, not cystic structures.\n\n- **Trypanosomiasis**: Chagas disease (caused by *Trypanosoma cruzi*) can affect the heart and gastrointestinal tract but rarely causes brain cysts like those seen in the image.\n\n- **Coccidioidal meningitis**: Caused by *Coccidioides immitis*, it typically affects immunocompromised individuals and presents with chronic meningitis rather than brain cysts.\n\nGiven the epidemiology and the histological findings, **cysticercosis** is the most probable diagnosis."
