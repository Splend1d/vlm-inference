Let's analyze each option in the context of this lesion:\n\nA. **is commonly associated with Von Hippel Lindau (VHL)**:\n   - Hemangioblastomas are indeed commonly associated with Von Hippel Lindau syndrome. VHL is a genetic disorder characterized by the development of various types of tumors, including hemangioblastomas in the brain and spinal cord.\n\nB. **contains inhibin A positive stromal cells**:\n   - Inhibin A is typically associated with granulosa cell tumors of the ovary and some other types of tumors. Hemangioblastomas do not contain inhibin A positive stromal cells. This statement is incorrect for hemangioblastomas.\n\nC. **is rich in reticulin**:\n   - Hemangioblastomas are known for their rich vascular network but are not particularly noted for being rich in reticulin. Reticulin is more commonly associated with other types of tumors or conditions where fibrous tissue is prominent. This statement is not accurate for hemangioblastomas.\n\nD. **all are correct**:\n   - Since options B and C are incorrect, this option cannot be true.\n\nGiven the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**A. is commonly associated with Von Hippel Lindau**"
