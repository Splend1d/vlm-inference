This would suggest a tachycardia, but not necessarily a very high rate like ventricular fibrillation.\n\nGiven these observations:\n- **Ventricular Preexcitation Syndrome** (Option A) typically shows a short PR interval and a delta wave, which are not present here.\n- **Ventricular Fibrillation** (Option B) would show completely chaotic and irregular electrical activity without any discernible QRS complexes, which is not the case here.\n- **Sustained Ventricular Tachycardia** (Option C) can present with a regular rhythm and wide QRS complexes, but it usually has a higher heart rate than what is shown here.\n- **Accelerated Idioventricular Rhythm** (Option D) is characterized by a regular rhythm with wide QRS complexes and a rate that is faster than normal sinus rhythm but slower than ventricular tachycardia. This matches the characteristics seen in the ECG.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most appropriate diagnosis is:\n\n**D. Accelerated idioventricular rhythm**."
