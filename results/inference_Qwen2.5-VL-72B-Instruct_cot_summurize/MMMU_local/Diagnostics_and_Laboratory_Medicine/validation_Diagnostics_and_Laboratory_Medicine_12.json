This type of pathology is often seen in the cerebral cortex and can also involve other areas of the brain.\n\nAmong the options given, the area of the brainstem that classically shows similar pathology is:\n\nA. Inferior olivary nucleus\n\nThe inferior olivary nucleus is known to show spongiform changes in conditions like CJD. The other options (Dentate nucleus, Locus ceruleus, and Basis pontis) are less commonly associated with this specific pattern of pathology in the context of CJD or similar diseases. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Inferior olivary nucleus."
