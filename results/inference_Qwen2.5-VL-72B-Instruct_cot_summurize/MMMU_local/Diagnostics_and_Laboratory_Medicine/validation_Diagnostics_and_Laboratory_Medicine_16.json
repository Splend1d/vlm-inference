Given the clinical presentation and the imaging characteristics, let's analyze the options:\n\n1. **Pilocytic Astrocytoma**: This is a low-grade glioma that typically presents in childhood and adolescence. It often occurs in the cerebellum and can cause symptoms such as headache, vomiting, and ataxia. On MRI, it usually appears well-circumscribed and may have cystic components. However, pilocytic astrocytomas are less likely to cause significant mass effect or midline shift.\n\n2. **Subependymoma**: These are slow-growing, benign tumors that arise from the ependymal cells lining the ventricles. They are more common in adults and typically present with obstructive hydrocephalus. The imaging appearance is usually a well-defined, homogeneous mass within the ventricle.\n\n3. **Glioblastoma**: This is an aggressive, high-grade glioma that is more common in adults. It typically presents with rapid neurological deterioration and has a highly infiltrative growth pattern. On MRI, it often shows significant enhancement and necrosis. It is less likely in a two-year-old child.\n\n4. **Anaplastic Ependymoma**: This is a higher-grade variant of ependymoma, which is a tumor arising from the ependymal cells lining the ventricles and central canal of the spinal cord. It can occur in children and can be located in the posterior fossa. On MRI, it can appear heterogeneous with areas of enhancement and necrosis. However, anaplastic ependymomas are less common in very young children.\n\n5. **Medulloblastoma**: This is the most common malignant brain tumor in children, typically occurring in the cerebellum. It presents with symptoms such as headache, vomiting, and ataxia due to increased intracranial pressure and cerebellar dysfunction. On MRI, it appears as a solid, enhancing mass in the cerebellar vermis, often with associated hydrocephalus.\n\nGiven the patient's age, the location of the mass in the posterior fossa, the symptoms of headache and vomiting, and the imaging characteristics showing a solid, enhancing mass with possible hydrocephalus, the most likely diagnosis is:\n\n**E. Medulloblastoma**\n\nMedulloblastoma fits the clinical and radiological picture best among the given options."
