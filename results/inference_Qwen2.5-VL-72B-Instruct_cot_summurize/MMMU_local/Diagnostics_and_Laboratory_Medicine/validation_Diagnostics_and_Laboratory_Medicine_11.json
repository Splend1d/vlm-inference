The image does not prominently display these features.\n\n2. **Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD)**: CJD is characterized by spongiform degeneration, neuronal loss, and astrocytic gliosis. The image shows vacuolation in the neuropil, which is consistent with spongiform changes seen in CJD.\n\n3. **Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP)**: PSP is associated with neurofibrillary tangles and tufted astrocytes, but it does not typically show the prominent spongiform changes seen in the image.\n\n4. **Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)**: ALS is characterized by motor neuron loss and gliosis in the spinal cord and brainstem. The image does not show specific features of ALS such as motor neuron loss or lower motor neuron pathology.\n\nGiven the presence of spongiform changes in the image, the most likely diagnosis is:\n\n**B. Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease**"
