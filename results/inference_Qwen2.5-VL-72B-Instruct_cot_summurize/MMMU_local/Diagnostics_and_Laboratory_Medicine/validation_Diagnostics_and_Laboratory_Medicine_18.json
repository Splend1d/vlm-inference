The brain on the right exhibits enlarged ventricles and a reduction in the size of the caudate nucleus, which is a characteristic feature of Huntington's Disease.\n\nHere's a detailed analysis:\n\n- **Cortical Atrophy (Option A)**: While Alzheimer's Disease does cause cortical atrophy, it typically affects the hippocampus and other areas more prominently, and the ventricles may not be as enlarged as shown in the image.\n  \n- **Caudate Atrophy (Option B)**: Huntington's Disease is known for causing atrophy of the caudate nucleus, which is clearly visible in the image on the right. The ventricles are also enlarged due to the loss of surrounding brain tissue.\n\n- **Normal Variation of Ventricular Size (Option C)**: The ventricles in the brain on the right are significantly larger than those in the normal brain, which is not a normal variation but rather indicative of a pathological condition.\n\n- **None of the Above (Option D)**: This option is incorrect because the changes observed are consistent with a specific neurological condition.\n\nGiven these observations, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. caudate atrophy consistent with Huntington's Disease**."
