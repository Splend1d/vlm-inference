PVL is a type of brain injury that affects the white matter of the brain, particularly around the ventricles. This condition is most commonly seen in premature infants, especially those born before 34 weeks of gestation.\n\nGiven this information, the most likely answer is:\n\nB. Post-partum in pre-term (< 34 weeks gestational age) infant\n\nThis is because the developing brain of a pre-term infant is particularly vulnerable to hypoxic-ischemic injury, which can lead to PVL. The other options do not align as closely with the typical presentation and timing of PVL."
