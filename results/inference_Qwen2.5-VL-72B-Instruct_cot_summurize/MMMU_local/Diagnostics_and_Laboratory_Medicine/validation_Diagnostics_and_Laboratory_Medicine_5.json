The presence of an abnormal fiber with a ragged-red appearance is characteristic of certain conditions.\n\nIn this case, the ragged-red fiber is indicative of a mitochondrial disorder. Mitochondrial disorders often lead to the accumulation of abnormal mitochondria within muscle fibers, which appear as ragged-red areas under Gomori trichrome staining.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. A mitochondrial disorder"
