Granulomas are small nodules of immune cells that form in response to certain infections or inflammatory conditions.\n\nGiven the clinical context of a 25-year-old immigrant with fever and a history of cord problems, the most likely etiology among the given options is:\n\n**D. Tuberculous meningitis**\n\nTuberculosis (TB) can cause granulomatous inflammation in various parts of the body, including the central nervous system (CNS). Tuberculous meningitis is a serious form of TB that affects the meninges, the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. It can present with symptoms such as fever, headache, and neurological deficits, which could include cord problems.\n\nHere's why the other options are less likely:\n\n- **A. Trypanosomiasis**: This is caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma and typically presents with different clinical features, such as Chagas disease or sleeping sickness, rather than granulomatous inflammation.\n- **B. Amebic encephalitis**: This is usually caused by Naegleria fowleri and presents acutely with severe headache, fever, and rapid neurological deterioration, not typically with granulomatous inflammation.\n- **C. Cerebral malaria**: While cerebral malaria can cause significant neurological symptoms, it does not typically present with granulomatous inflammation.\n- **E. Aspergillosis**: This fungal infection can cause granulomatous inflammation, but it is less common in immunocompetent individuals and typically presents with different clinical features, such as sinusitis or pulmonary involvement.\n\nTherefore, based on the clinical presentation and the histological findings, **D. Tuberculous meningitis** is the most likely diagnosis."
