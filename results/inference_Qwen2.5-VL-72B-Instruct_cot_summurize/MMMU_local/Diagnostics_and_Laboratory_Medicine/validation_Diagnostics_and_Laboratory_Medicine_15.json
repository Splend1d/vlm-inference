This condition is commonly associated with premature birth.\n\nThe most important predisposing factor for PVL is:\n\nC. Premature birth\n\nPremature birth, especially before 32 weeks of gestation, is the most significant risk factor for PVL. Other factors such as hypoxic-ischemic events, sepsis, and placental abruption can contribute to the development of PVL, but they are not as strongly associated as premature birth. Nuchal cord is not typically linked to PVL."
