For an ideal gas, the equation for an adiabatic process is given by:\n\n\\[ PV^\\gamma = \\text{constant} \\]\n\nwhere \\(\\gamma\\) is the adiabatic index (specific heat ratio).\n\nFrom the graph, we can see that the pressure \\(P\\) decreases as the volume \\(V\\) increases along the path from state 1 to state 2. This indicates an expansion of the gas.\n\nFor an adiabatic expansion of an ideal gas:\n- The internal energy \\(U\\) of the gas decreases because work is done by the gas (\\(W > 0\\)).\n- Since \\(Q = 0\\) (no heat transfer), the decrease in internal energy must be due to the work done by the gas.\n- The internal energy \\(U\\) of an ideal gas is directly proportional to its temperature \\(T\\). Therefore, a decrease in internal energy implies a decrease in temperature.\n\nThus, for the adiabatic process 1-2:\n\\[ \\Delta T < 0 \\]\n\\[ Q = 0 \\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe correct choice is:\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
