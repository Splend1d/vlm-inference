We can use the principle of conservation of mass (continuity equation) for this purpose.\n\n### Given Data:\n- Initial depth of water: \\( h = 40 \\text{ cm} = 0.4 \\text{ m} \\)\n- Velocity of water flow from the outfall: \\( V = 2 \\text{ m/s} \\)\n- Absorption rate of the porous bed: \\( v_a = 8 \\text{ mm/s} = 0.008 \\text{ m/s} \\)\n- Depth of the system into the paper: \\( D = 5 \\text{ m} \\)\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Calculate the volumetric flow rate of water from the outfall:**\n\n   The volumetric flow rate \\( Q \\) can be calculated using the formula:\n   \\[\n   Q = A \\cdot V\n   \\]\n   where \\( A \\) is the cross-sectional area of the flow and \\( V \\) is the velocity.\n\n   The cross-sectional area \\( A \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   A = h \\cdot D = 0.4 \\text{ m} \\times 5 \\text{ m} = 2 \\text{ m}^2\n   \\]\n\n   Therefore, the volumetric flow rate \\( Q \\) is:\n   \\[\n   Q = 2 \\text{ m}^2 \\times 2 \\text{ m/s} = 4 \\text{ m}^3/\\text{s}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the absorption rate per unit length of the porous bed:**\n\n   The absorption rate per unit length \\( q \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   q = v_a \\cdot D\n   \\]\n   where \\( v_a \\) is the absorption velocity and \\( D \\) is the depth of the system.\n\n   Substituting the values, we get:\n   \\[\n   q = 0.008 \\text{ m/s} \\times 5 \\text{ m} = 0.04 \\text{ m}^3/\\text{s}\\cdot\\text{m}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the length \\( L \\) of the porous bed required to absorb the entire flow:**\n\n   The total absorption rate for the length \\( L \\) of the bed should equal the volumetric flow rate \\( Q \\):\n   \\[\n   q \\cdot L = Q\n   \\]\n\n   Substituting the known values:\n   \\[\n   0.04 \\text{ m}^3/\\text{s}\\cdot\\text{m} \\times L = 4 \\text{ m}^3/\\text{s}\n   \\]\n\n   Solving for \\( L \\):\n   \\[\n   L = \\frac{4 \\text{ m}^3/\\text{s}}{0.04 \\text{ m}^3/\\text{s}\\cdot\\text{m}} = 100 \\text{ m}\n   \\]\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe length \\( L \\) of the bed which will completely absorb the storm water is \\( 100 \\text{ m} \\).\n\nHowever, since the options provided do not include 100 m, it seems there might be a discrepancy or a different interpretation needed. Based on the closest option, the answer would be:\n\n**C. 90 m** (as it is the closest value to 100 m among the given options)."
