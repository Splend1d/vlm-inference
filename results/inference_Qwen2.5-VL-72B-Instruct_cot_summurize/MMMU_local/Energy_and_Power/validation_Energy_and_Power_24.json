The steam is used to heat the feed in each stage, causing evaporation. The condensate from the steam is collected and removed from the system.\n\nThe capacity of the evaporator is determined by the amount of water that can be evaporated in each stage. Since the feed moves through all stages sequentially, the total capacity of the evaporator is the sum of the capacities of all the stages.\n\nGiven the options:\nA. E1 + E2 + E3\nB. E3\nC. E1\nD. E1 + E2\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nA. E1 + E2 + E3\n\nThis is because the total capacity of the forward feed evaporator is the sum of the capacities of all the stages it contains."
