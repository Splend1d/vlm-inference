                    "text": "To determine the maximum value of the live load force created in bar CG, we need to consider both the uniform live load and the concentrated live load and their effects on the truss.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Uniform Live Load\n\nThe uniform live load is given as \\(0.32 \\text{ kip/ft}\\). The total length of the truss is \\(90 \\text{ ft}\\).\n\nThe total uniform load on the truss is:\n\\[\n0.32 \\text{ kip/ft} \\times 90 \\text{ ft} = 28.8 \\text{ kips}\n\\]\n\nThis load is distributed uniformly across the truss. To find the reaction forces at supports A and F, we use the fact that the truss is symmetric and simply supported:\n\n\\[\nR_A = R_F = \\frac{28.8 \\text{ kips}}{2} = 14.4 \\text{ kips}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Concentrated Live Load\n\nThe concentrated live load is \\(24 \\text{ kips}\\). We need to place this load such that it produces the largest force in bar CG. Given the symmetry of the truss, placing the load at point C will maximize the force in bar CG.\n\nWhen the \\(24 \\text{ kips}\\) load is applied at point C, the reactions at A and F will change. Using the principle of equilibrium:\n\n\\[\nR_A + R_F = 24 \\text{ kips}\n\\]\n\nSince the truss is symmetric, the reactions will be equal:\n\n\\[\nR_A = R_F = \\frac{24 \\text{ kips}}{2} = 12 \\text{ kips}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Combine the Loads\n\nNow, we combine the effects of the uniform load and the concentrated load. The total reaction at each support when both loads are applied is:\n\n\\[\nR_A = 14.4 \\text{ kips} + 12 \\text{ kips} = 26.4 \\text{ kips}\n\\]\n\\[\nR_F = 14.4 \\text{ kips} + 12 \\text{ kips} = 26.4 \\text{ kips}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Force in Bar CG\n\nTo find the force in bar CG, we use the method of joints or sections. Considering joint C:\n\n- The vertical component of the force in bar CG must balance the vertical forces at joint C.\n- The vertical force at joint C due to the concentrated load is \\(24 \\text{ kips}\\).\n\nUsing the geometry of the truss, the angle between bar CG and the horizontal is \\(45^\\circ\\). Therefore, the vertical component of the force in bar CG is:\n\n\\[\nF_{CG} \\sin(45^\\circ) = 24 \\text{ kips}\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\(F_{CG}\\):\n\n\\[\nF_{CG} = \\frac{24 \\text{ kips}}{\\sin(45^\\circ)} = \\frac{24 \\text{ kips}}{\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}} = 24 \\text{ kips} \\times \\sqrt{2} \\approx 33.94 \\text{ kips}\n\\]\n\nHowever, considering the combined effect of the uniform load and the concentrated load, the maximum force in bar CG will be less than this value. Given the options, the closest value is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{9.75 \\text{ kips compression}}\n\\]"
