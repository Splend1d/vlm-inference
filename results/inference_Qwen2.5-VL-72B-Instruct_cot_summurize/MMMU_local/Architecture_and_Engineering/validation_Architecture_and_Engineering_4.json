This discrepancy suggests that there might be an error in the setup or the readings. However, if we assume that the level instrument is correctly set up and the readings are accurate, we should consider the average of these two values to find the most likely height difference.\n\nThe average height difference \\( h_{AB} \\) is:\n\\[\nh_{AB} = \\frac{(-0.100 \\, \\text{m}) + (0.100 \\, \\text{m})}{2} = \\frac{0}{2} = 0 \\, \\text{m}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct height difference \\( h_{AB} \\) between points A and B is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{0}\n\\]"
