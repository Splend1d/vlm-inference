This indicates that it is a tetrose (a sugar with four carbon atoms).\n\n2. **Identify the functional group at the first carbon atom**: The first carbon atom (the one furthest from the -CH2OH group) has a carbonyl group (C=O). This indicates that it is an aldose (a sugar with an aldehyde group at the first carbon).\n\n3. **Combine the information**: Since the molecule is a tetrose and an aldose, it is classified as an aldotetrose.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. It's an aldotetrose."
