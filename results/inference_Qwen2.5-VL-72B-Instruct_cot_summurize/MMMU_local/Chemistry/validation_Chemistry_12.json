This means that if we take the given compound and reflect it across a plane, the resulting structure should be one of the options provided.\n\nLet's analyze the given compound:\n\n```\n      H\n     / \\\n    Br  Me\n   /    |\n  H     OH\n   \\    /\n    Et  Me\n```\n\nWe need to find the mirror image of this structure. To do this, we can mentally flip the molecule across a vertical plane (or any plane that will give us a mirror image).\n\nIf we flip the molecule, the positions of the atoms will change as follows:\n- The hydrogen (H) on the top will stay on the top.\n- The bromine (Br) on the left will move to the right.\n- The methyl (Me) on the right will move to the left.\n- The hydroxyl (OH) group will stay in the same relative position but will be on the opposite side of the molecule.\n\nSo, the mirror image should look like this:\n\n```\n      H\n     / \\\n    Me  Br\n   /    |\n  H     OH\n   \\    /\n    Et  Me\n```\n\nNow, let's compare this with the given options:\n\n(a)\n```\n      Me\n     / \\\n    H   Br\n   /    |\n  HO    Me\n   \\    /\n    Et  Me\n```\n\n(b)\n```\n      Me\n     / \\\n    H   Br\n   /    |\n  Me    OH\n   \\    /\n    Et  Me\n```\n\n(c)\n```\n      Br\n     / \\\n    Me  H\n   /    |\n  HO    Me\n   \\    /\n    Et  Me\n```\n\n(d)\n```\n      Br\n     / \\\n    Me  H\n   /    |\n  Et    OH\n   \\    /\n    Me  Me\n```\n\nThe correct mirror image matches option (b):\n\n```\n      Me\n     / \\\n    H   Br\n   /    |\n  Me    OH\n   \\    /\n    Et  Me\n```\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n\\boxed{B}"
