This decreases the electron density on the nitrogen, making it less basic.\n- **Ph \u2014 NH\u2082**: The nitrogen atom is attached to one phenyl group, which still has an electron-withdrawing effect but less than two phenyl groups.\n- **Cyclohexane with NH\u2082**: The nitrogen atom is in a cyclohexane ring, which is relatively electron-rich and not affected by electron-withdrawing groups. This makes it more basic.\n\nThe order given is correct: \\( \\text{Ph} \u2014 \\text{NH} \u2014 \\text{Ph} < \\text{Ph} \u2014 \\text{NH}_2 < \\text{(strong base)} \\).\n\n### Set (b):\n- **Pyridine (N in a six-membered ring)**: The nitrogen atom is part of an aromatic system and is less basic due to delocalization of the lone pair.\n- **Pyrrole (N in a five-membered ring)**: The nitrogen atom is also part of an aromatic system but is more basic than pyridine because the lone pair is more available for donation.\n- **Piperidine (N in a six-membered ring, non-aromatic)**: The nitrogen atom is not part of an aromatic system and is more basic than both pyridine and pyrrole.\n\nThe order given is incorrect: \\( \\text{pyrrole} < \\text{pyridine} < \\text{piperidine} \\). It should be \\( \\text{pyridine} < \\text{pyrrole} < \\text{piperidine} \\).\n\n### Set (c):\n- **Pyridazine (N in a six-membered ring, two nitrogens)**: The nitrogen atoms are part of an aromatic system and are less basic.\n- **Pyrrolidine (N in a five-membered ring, non-aromatic)**: The nitrogen atom is not part of an aromatic system and is more basic.\n- **Pyrazole (N in a five-membered ring, two nitrogens)**: The nitrogen atoms are part of an aromatic system but are more basic than pyridazine due to the smaller ring size.\n\nThe order given is correct: \\( \\text{pyridazine} > \\text{pyrrolidine} > \\text{pyrazole} \\).\n\n### Set (d):\n- **Aniline with NO\u2082**: The nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing, decreasing the electron density on the nitrogen and making it less basic.\n- **Aniline**: The nitrogen atom is in a benzene ring, which is relatively electron-rich.\n- **Aniline with CH\u2083**: The methyl group is electron-donating, increasing the electron density on the nitrogen and making it more basic.\n\nThe order given is correct: \\( \\text{aniline with NO}_2 < \\text{aniline} < \\text{aniline with CH}_3 \\).\n\nTherefore, the incorrect set is:\n\n\\boxed{B}"
