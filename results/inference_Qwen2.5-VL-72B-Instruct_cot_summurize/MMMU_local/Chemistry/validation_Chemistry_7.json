In this compound, we need to check each carbon atom:\n\n- The first carbon (from left) is bonded to Br, Br, CH3, and C.\n- The second carbon is bonded to Br, C, C, and C.\n- The third carbon is bonded to Br, C, C, and C.\n- The fourth carbon (from left) is bonded to Br, Br, CH3, and C.\n\nFrom this analysis, the first and fourth carbons are chiral centers because they are bonded to four different groups.\n\n### Step 2: Determine Possible Configurations at Each Chiral Center\nEach chiral center can have two possible configurations: R or S. Therefore, for two chiral centers, the total number of possible stereoisomers is \\(2^2 = 4\\).\n\nHowever, we need to consider if there are any meso forms or other symmetries that might reduce the number of unique stereoisomers.\n\n### Step 3: Check for Meso Forms\nA meso form is a stereoisomer that has an internal plane of symmetry and is superimposable on its mirror image. In this case, the compound does not have an internal plane of symmetry that would create a meso form.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Unique Stereoisomers\nSince there are no meso forms and each chiral center can independently be R or S, the total number of unique stereoisomers is \\(2^2 = 4\\).\n\nHowever, considering the complexity and the possibility of additional configurations due to the presence of multiple bromine atoms, the correct answer should be re-evaluated with more detailed structural analysis.\n\nGiven the options, the most plausible and comprehensive answer is:\n\n\\boxed{8}"
