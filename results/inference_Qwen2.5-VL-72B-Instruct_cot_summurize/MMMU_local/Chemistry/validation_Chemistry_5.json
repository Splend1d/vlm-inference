Therefore, C-2 is **R**.\n\n#### C-3 Configuration:\n1. **Identify the substituents around C-3:**\n   - H (hydrogen)\n   - Cl (chlorine)\n   - CH\u2083 (methyl)\n   - C\u2082H\u2085 (ethyl)\n\n2. **Assign priorities based on atomic number:**\n   - Cl (highest priority, 17)\n   - C\u2082H\u2085 (second highest priority, carbon with more atoms attached)\n   - CH\u2083 (third highest priority, carbon with fewer atoms attached)\n   - H (lowest priority, 1)\n\n3. **Visualize the molecule in 3D:**\n   - Place the lowest priority group (H) away from you.\n   - Observe the order of the remaining groups (Cl, C\u2082H\u2085, CH\u2083) in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction.\n\n4. **Determine the configuration:**\n   - If the order is Cl \u2192 C\u2082H\u2085 \u2192 CH\u2083 in a clockwise direction, it is R.\n   - If the order is Cl \u2192 C\u2082H\u2085 \u2192 CH\u2083 in a counterclockwise direction, it is S.\n\nFrom the structure, the order is Cl \u2192 C\u2082H\u2085 \u2192 CH\u2083 in a counterclockwise direction when viewed with H away from us. Therefore, C-3 is **S**.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe configuration at C-2 and C-3 is **2R, 3S**.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n**A. 2R, 3S**"
