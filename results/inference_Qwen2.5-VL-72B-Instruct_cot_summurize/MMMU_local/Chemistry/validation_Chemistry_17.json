This means that the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image.\n\nLet's analyze each Newman projection:\n\n**P:**\n- The front carbon has H and Me.\n- The back carbon has OH and H.\n- The middle carbon has OH and Me.\nThis does not match the structure of meso-2,3-butanediol because the hydroxyl groups are not in the correct positions relative to each other.\n\n**Q:**\n- The front carbon has H and Me.\n- The back carbon has OH and H.\n- The middle carbon has OH and Me.\nThis also does not match the structure of meso-2,3-butanediol for the same reason as P.\n\n**R:**\n- The front carbon has H and Me.\n- The back carbon has OH and H.\n- The middle carbon has OH and H.\nThis matches the structure of meso-2,3-butanediol because the hydroxyl groups are in the correct positions relative to each other, and there is an internal plane of symmetry.\n\n**S:**\n- The front carbon has H and Me.\n- The back carbon has OH and H.\n- The middle carbon has OH and H.\nThis also matches the structure of meso-2,3-butanediol for the same reason as R.\n\nTherefore, the correct Newman projections of meso-2,3-butanediol are R and S.\n\nThe answer is: \\boxed{C}"
