                    "text": "To determine the correct statement about the geometry of the glycinium cation, let's analyze the structure step by step.\n\n1. **Identify the Hybridization and Geometry:**\n   - The nitrogen (N) atom is bonded to three hydrogen atoms and one carbon atom. This indicates that the nitrogen atom is \\(sp^3\\) hybridized, which means it has a tetrahedral geometry around it. Therefore, the geometry around the nitrogen atom is not planar.\n   - The carbon atom attached to the nitrogen (leftmost C) is bonded to four other atoms (one nitrogen, two hydrogens, and one carbon). This also indicates \\(sp^3\\) hybridization, meaning it has a tetrahedral geometry.\n   - The carbon atom attached to the oxygen (rightmost C) is part of a carbonyl group (C=O), which is \\(sp^2\\) hybridized, indicating trigonal planar geometry around this carbon atom.\n\n2. **Evaluate Each Option:**\n   - **Option A:** The leftmost C atom and all the atoms directly bonded to it lie in the same plane.\n     - Since the leftmost C atom is \\(sp^3\\) hybridized, it has a tetrahedral geometry, and therefore, not all the atoms directly bonded to it lie in the same plane. So, this option is incorrect.\n   - **Option B:** Both C atoms and both O atoms lie in the same plane.\n     - The rightmost C atom (part of the carbonyl group) is \\(sp^2\\) hybridized and lies in a plane with the two O atoms. However, the leftmost C atom is \\(sp^3\\) hybridized and does not lie in the same plane as the rightmost C and O atoms. So, this option is incorrect.\n   - **Option C:** The N-C-C bond angle is 180\u00b0.\n     - The nitrogen atom is \\(sp^3\\) hybridized, so the bond angles around it are approximately 109.5\u00b0, not 180\u00b0. So, this option is incorrect.\n   - **Option D:** The geometry around the N atom is planar.\n     - As discussed earlier, the nitrogen atom is \\(sp^3\\) hybridized, which means it has a tetrahedral geometry, not planar. So, this option is incorrect.\n\nSince none of the options A, B, C, or D are correct based on the analysis, we need to re-evaluate the problem. The correct answer should be:\n\n\\boxed{B}"
