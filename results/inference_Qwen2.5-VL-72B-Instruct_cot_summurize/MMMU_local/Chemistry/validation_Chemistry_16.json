Identify the central atom and the surrounding atoms.\n2. Determine the number of electron pairs (both bonding and non-bonding) around the central atom.\n3. Use the VSEPR (Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion) theory to predict the molecular geometry.\n\nLet's analyze the given Lewis structure step by step:\n\n1. The central atom is sulfur (S).\n2. There are four oxygen (O) atoms surrounding the sulfur atom.\n3. Each oxygen atom is bonded to the sulfur atom with a single bond, and each oxygen atom also has three lone pairs of electrons. However, for the purpose of determining the molecular geometry, we only consider the bonding pairs around the central atom.\n\nSince there are four bonding pairs around the sulfur atom and no lone pairs, the electron pair geometry is tetrahedral. In a tetrahedral arrangement, the four atoms are positioned at the corners of a tetrahedron, with bond angles of approximately 109.5 degrees.\n\nTherefore, the geometric shape of the molecule is tetrahedral.\n\nThe correct answer is: \\boxed{D}"
