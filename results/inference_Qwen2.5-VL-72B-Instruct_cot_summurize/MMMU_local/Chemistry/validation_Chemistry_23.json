The data are used to create a calibration plot, shown below. <image 1> A 0.630 g sample of the ore is completely dissolved in concentrated $HNO_3$(aq). The mixture is diluted with water to a final volume of 50.00 mL. Assume that all the cobalt in the ore sample is converted to $Co^{2+}$(aq). Calculate the number of moles of $Co^{2+}$(aq) in the 50.00 mL solution. Only write the result number, in the unit of 10^-4 mol.\n\n"
