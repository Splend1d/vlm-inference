The product (A) will be nitrobenzene.\n\nLet's evaluate each statement:\n\n**A. Product is aromatic**\n- Nitrobenzene retains the benzene ring structure, which is aromatic. Therefore, this statement is correct.\n\n**B. Product has high dipole moment**\n- Nitrobenzene has a strong electron-withdrawing nitro group (-NO\u2082), which creates a significant dipole moment due to the difference in electronegativity between nitrogen and oxygen atoms. Therefore, this statement is correct.\n\n**C. Product has less resonance energy**\n- The resonance energy of a molecule is related to its stability. Nitrobenzene still has the benzene ring, which contributes to its resonance energy. However, the presence of the electron-withdrawing nitro group slightly reduces the overall resonance energy compared to benzene. This statement is correct because the resonance energy is indeed less than that of benzene.\n\n**D. Product is soluble in polar solvent**\n- Nitrobenzene is not very soluble in polar solvents like water due to its nonpolar benzene ring. It is more soluble in organic solvents. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\nBased on the analysis, the incorrect statement is:\n\n\\boxed{D}"
