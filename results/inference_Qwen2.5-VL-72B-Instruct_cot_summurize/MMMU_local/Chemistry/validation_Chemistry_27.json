According to Coulomb's law, the strength of the interaction between two charged particles is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them and directly proportional to the product of their charges.\n\nGiven that all the ions listed are negatively charged, the key factors to consider are:\n\n1. **Charge**: The magnitude of the charge affects the strength of the interaction. A higher charge will result in stronger interactions.\n2. **Ionic Radius**: A smaller ionic radius means the charge is more concentrated, leading to stronger interactions with water molecules.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n- **$Cl^-$**: Charge = -1, Ionic Radius = 181 pm\n- **$I^-$**: Charge = -1, Ionic Radius = 216 pm\n- **$S^{2-}$**: Charge = -2, Ionic Radius = 184 pm\n- **$Te^{2-}$**: Charge = -2, Ionic Radius = 221 pm\n\nFrom the table:\n- Both $S^{2-}$ and $Te^{2-}$ have a higher charge (-2) compared to $Cl^-$ and $I^-$ (-1), so they will have stronger interactions due to their higher charge.\n- Between $S^{2-}$ and $Te^{2-}$, $S^{2-}$ has a smaller ionic radius (184 pm) compared to $Te^{2-}$ (221 pm). This means the charge of $S^{2-}$ is more concentrated, leading to stronger interactions with water molecules.\n\nTherefore, the anion most likely to have the strongest interactions with nearby water molecules in an aqueous solution is:\n\n\\boxed{C}"
