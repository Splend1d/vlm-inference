Five different samples of $CaCO_3$(s) of known mass react with an excess of 2.0 M $HCl$(aq) in identical sealed, rigid reaction vessels. The pressure of the gas produced is measured with a pressure gauge attached to the reaction vessel. Since the reaction is exothermic, the reaction system is cooled to its original temperature before the pressure is recorded. The experimental data are used to create the calibration line below. <image 1> The experiment is repeated with an eggshell sample, and the experimental data are recorded in the table below. <image 2> Which of the following modifications will increase the rate of the reaction the most? \n\nA.

                    "text": "To determine which modification will increase the rate of the reaction the most, we need to consider the factors that affect the rate of a chemical reaction. These factors include concentration, temperature, surface area, and the nature of the reactants.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n**A. Using 2.0 M \\( CH_3COOH \\)(aq) instead of 2.0 M \\( HCl \\)(aq)**\n\n- Acetic acid (\\( CH_3COOH \\)) is a weaker acid compared to hydrochloric acid (\\( HCl \\)). This means that \\( HCl \\) will dissociate more completely in solution, providing a higher concentration of hydrogen ions (\\( H^+ \\)). A higher concentration of \\( H^+ \\) ions will generally lead to a faster reaction rate. Therefore, using \\( CH_3COOH \\) instead of \\( HCl \\) would likely decrease the reaction rate.\n\n**B. Cooling the \\( HCl \\)(aq) to a lower temperature than it was in the original experiment**\n\n- Lowering the temperature generally decreases the kinetic energy of the molecules, reducing the frequency and energy of collisions between reactant molecules. This results in a slower reaction rate. Therefore, cooling the \\( HCl \\) would decrease the reaction rate.\n\n**C. Reducing the volume of the reaction vessel**\n\n- Reducing the volume of the reaction vessel increases the concentration of the reactants if the amount of substance remains the same. Higher concentrations lead to more frequent collisions between reactant molecules, increasing the reaction rate. However, since the reaction is already taking place in a sealed, rigid vessel, changing the volume might not be feasible or have a significant impact without altering the pressure significantly.\n\n**D. Using eggshells that are more finely powdered than those used in the original experiment**\n\n- Increasing the surface area of the eggshells by grinding them into a finer powder allows for more contact between the solid \\( CaCO_3 \\) and the aqueous \\( HCl \\). This increases the number of active sites available for the reaction, leading to a higher reaction rate.\n\nGiven these considerations, the modification that will increase the rate of the reaction the most is:\n\n**D. Using eggshells that are more finely powdered than those used in the original experiment.**"
