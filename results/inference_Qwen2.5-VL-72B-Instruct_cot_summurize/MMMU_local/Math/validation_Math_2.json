This is a classic example of the set cover problem, which can be formulated as an integer linear programming (ILP) problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n#### Gallery (a):\n\n1. **Identify the Rooms and Doorways:**\n   - There are 4 rooms.\n   - The doorways connecting the rooms are as follows:\n     - Room 1 to Room 2\n     - Room 2 to Room 3\n     - Room 3 to Room 4\n\n2. **Formulate the ILP Problem:**\n   - Let \\( x_i \\) be a binary variable indicating whether an attendant is placed at doorway \\( i \\).\n   - We need to ensure that each room is supervised by at least one attendant.\n\n   The constraints for each room being supervised are:\n   - Room 1: \\( x_1 \\geq 1 \\)\n   - Room 2: \\( x_1 + x_2 \\geq 1 \\)\n   - Room 3: \\( x_2 + x_3 \\geq 1 \\)\n   - Room 4: \\( x_3 \\geq 1 \\)\n\n   The objective is to minimize the total number of attendants:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Minimize } x_1 + x_2 + x_3\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve the ILP Problem:**\n   - From the constraints, we can see that placing an attendant at doorway 2 will cover both Room 2 and Room 3.\n   - Placing an attendant at doorway 1 will cover Room 1.\n   - Placing an attendant at doorway 3 will cover Room 4.\n\n   Therefore, the minimum number of attendants required is 2 (one at doorway 1 and one at doorway 3).\n\n#### Gallery (b):\n\n1. **Identify the Rooms and Doorways:**\n   - There are 6 rooms.\n   - The doorways connecting the rooms are as follows:\n     - Room 1 to Room 2\n     - Room 2 to Room 3\n     - Room 3 to Room 4\n     - Room 4 to Room 5\n     - Room 5 to Room 6\n     - Room 1 to Room 4\n     - Room 2 to Room 5\n     - Room 3 to Room 6\n\n2. **Formulate the ILP Problem:**\n   - Let \\( x_i \\) be a binary variable indicating whether an attendant is placed at doorway \\( i \\).\n   - We need to ensure that each room is supervised by at least one attendant.\n\n   The constraints for each room being supervised are:\n   - Room 1: \\( x_1 + x_6 \\geq 1 \\)\n   - Room 2: \\( x_1 + x_7 \\geq 1 \\)\n   - Room 3: \\( x_2 + x_8 \\geq 1 \\)\n   - Room 4: \\( x_3 + x_6 \\geq 1 \\)\n   - Room 5: \\( x_4 + x_7 \\geq 1 \\)\n   - Room 6: \\( x_5 + x_8 \\geq 1 \\)\n\n   The objective is to minimize the total number of attendants:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Minimize } x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 + x_6 + x_7 + x_8\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve the ILP Problem:**\n   - From the constraints, we can see that placing an attendant at doorway 1 will cover Room 1 and Room 2.\n   - Placing an attendant at doorway 4 will cover Room 4 and Room 5.\n   - Placing an attendant at doorway 8 will cover Room 3 and Room 6.\n\n   Therefore, the minimum number of attendants required is 3 (one at doorway 1, one at doorway 4, and one at doorway 8).\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe correct choice is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{B}\n\\]"
