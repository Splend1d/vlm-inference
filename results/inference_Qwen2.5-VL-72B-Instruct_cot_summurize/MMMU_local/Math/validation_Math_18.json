BFS explores all the vertices of a graph level by level, starting from the root node and visiting all its neighbors before moving to the next level.\n\nLet's analyze each step in both diagrams:\n\n### Diagram (a):\n- **Step 1**: The root node is selected.\n- **Step 2**: The nodes directly connected to the root are visited.\n- **Step 3**: The nodes connected to the nodes visited in Step 2 are visited.\n- **Output**: The final spanning tree is formed.\n\nThis sequence shows that the algorithm visits all nodes at one level before moving to the next level, which is characteristic of a breadth-first search.\n\n### Diagram (b):\n- **Step 1**: The root node is selected.\n- **Step 2**: One of the nodes directly connected to the root is visited.\n- **Step 3**: A node connected to the node visited in Step 2 is visited.\n- **Step 4**: Another node connected to the node visited in Step 2 is visited.\n- **Step 5**: The remaining nodes are visited.\n- **Output**: The final spanning tree is formed.\n\nIn this sequence, the algorithm does not visit all nodes at one level before moving to the next level. Instead, it appears to follow a depth-first search (DFS) approach, where it explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.\n\nBased on the analysis, the diagram that illustrates the construction of a breadth-first spanning tree is:\n\n\\boxed{A}"
