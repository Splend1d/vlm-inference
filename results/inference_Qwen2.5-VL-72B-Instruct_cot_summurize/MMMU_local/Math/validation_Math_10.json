A regular graph is a graph where every vertex has the same degree. The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to it.\n\nLet's analyze the degrees of each vertex in the given graph:\n\n- Vertex \\(a\\): It is connected to vertices \\(b\\), \\(d\\), and \\(e\\). So, the degree of \\(a\\) is 3.\n- Vertex \\(b\\): It is connected to vertices \\(a\\), \\(c\\), and \\(h\\). So, the degree of \\(b\\) is 3.\n- Vertex \\(c\\): It is connected to vertices \\(b\\), \\(d\\), and \\(f\\). So, the degree of \\(c\\) is 3.\n- Vertex \\(d\\): It is connected to vertices \\(a\\), \\(c\\), and \\(e\\). So, the degree of \\(d\\) is 3.\n- Vertex \\(e\\): It is connected to vertices \\(a\\), \\(d\\), and \\(f\\). So, the degree of \\(e\\) is 3.\n- Vertex \\(f\\): It is connected to vertices \\(c\\), \\(e\\), and \\(g\\). So, the degree of \\(f\\) is 3.\n- Vertex \\(g\\): It is connected to vertices \\(f\\) and \\(h\\). So, the degree of \\(g\\) is 2.\n- Vertex \\(h\\): It is connected to vertices \\(b\\) and \\(g\\). So, the degree of \\(h\\) is 2.\n\nFrom the above analysis, we can see that the degrees of the vertices are not all the same. Specifically, vertices \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), \\(d\\), \\(e\\), and \\(f\\) have degree 3, while vertices \\(g\\) and \\(h\\) have degree 2. Therefore, the graph is not a regular graph because not all vertices have the same degree.\n\nThe correct answer is \\(\\boxed{C}\\)."
