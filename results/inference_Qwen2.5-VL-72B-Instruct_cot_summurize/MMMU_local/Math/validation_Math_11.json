A function is convex if its second derivative is non-negative for all \\( x \\), and it is concave if its second derivative is non-positive for all \\( x \\).\n\nLet's start by finding the first derivative of \\( f(x) \\):\n\\[ f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(x^2 - 6x + 4) = 2x - 6. \\]\n\nNext, we find the second derivative of \\( f(x) \\):\n\\[ f''(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(2x - 6) = 2. \\]\n\nThe second derivative \\( f''(x) = 2 \\) is a constant and is always positive for all \\( x \\). Since the second derivative is positive, the function \\( f(x) = x^2 - 6x + 4 \\) is convex.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{A}\n\\]"
