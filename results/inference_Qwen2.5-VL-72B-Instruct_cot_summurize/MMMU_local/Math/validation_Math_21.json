The next iterate will be positive but smaller than \\( x_0 \\). As \\( x_n \\) approaches 1 from the right, the denominator \\( 1 - x_n \\) becomes very small, causing the next iterate to jump to a large negative value, and the iteration will not converge to 0.\n\n4. **When \\( x_0 < 1 \\)**:\n   For \\( x_0 < 1 \\), \\( 1 - x_0 > 0 \\), so \\( \\frac{-x_0^2}{1 - x_0} < 0 \\). The next iterate will be negative. As \\( x_n \\) approaches 0 from the left, the denominator \\( 1 - x_n \\) approaches 1, and the next iterate will approach 0. Therefore, the iteration will converge to 0.\n\nFrom the above analysis, the Newton-Raphson method will converge when \\( x_0 \\) is less than 1.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{C}\n\\]"
