The vertices of the feasible region will give us potential solutions.\n\n#### Plotting the Constraints:\n1. **Investment Constraint**:\n   \\[ 25000x_1 + 80000x_2 = 200000 \\]\n   - When \\( x_1 = 0 \\), \\( x_2 = \\frac{200000}{80000} = 2.5 \\)\n   - When \\( x_2 = 0 \\), \\( x_1 = \\frac{200000}{25000} = 8 \\)\n\n2. **Customer Capacity Constraint**:\n   \\[ 1200x_1 + 2000x_2 = 6000 \\]\n   - When \\( x_1 = 0 \\), \\( x_2 = \\frac{6000}{2000} = 3 \\)\n   - When \\( x_2 = 0 \\), \\( x_1 = \\frac{6000}{1200} = 5 \\]\n\n### Finding the Feasible Region:\nThe feasible region is the area where both constraints are satisfied. The vertices of the feasible region are:\n- \\( (0, 0) \\)\n- \\( (0, 2.5) \\)\n- \\( (5, 0) \\)\n- Intersection of the two lines\n\n#### Intersection Point Calculation:\nSolve the system of equations:\n\\[ 25000x_1 + 80000x_2 = 200000 \\]\n\\[ 1200x_1 + 2000x_2 = 6000 \\]\n\nMultiply the second equation by 40:\n\\[ 48000x_1 + 80000x_2 = 240000 \\]\n\nSubtract the first equation from this result:\n\\[ 48000x_1 + 80000x_2 - (25000x_1 + 80000x_2) = 240000 - 200000 \\]\n\\[ 23000x_1 = 40000 \\]\n\\[ x_1 = \\frac{40000}{23000} \\approx 1.74 \\]\n\nSubstitute \\( x_1 \\) back into the second equation:\n\\[ 1200(1.74) + 2000x_2 = 6000 \\]\n\\[ 2088 + 2000x_2 = 6000 \\]\n\\[ 2000x_2 = 3912 \\]\n\\[ x_2 \\approx 1.96 \\]\n\nSo, the intersection point is approximately \\( (1.74, 1.96) \\).\n\n### Evaluating the Objective Function at Vertices:\n1. \\( (0, 0) \\):\n   \\[ f(0, 0) = 4000(0) + 7000(0) = 0 \\]\n\n2. \\( (0, 2.5) \\):\n   \\[ f(0, 2.5) = 4000(0) + 7000(2.5) = 17500 \\]\n\n3. \\( (5, 0) \\):\n   \\[ f(5, 0) = 4000(5) + 7000(0) = 20000 \\]\n\n4. \\( (1.74, 1.96) \\):\n   \\[ f(1.74, 1.96) \\approx 4000(1.74) + 7000(1.96) \\approx 6960 + 13720 = 20680 \\]\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe maximum profit is achieved at the point \\( (1.74, 1.96) \\). Since the number of boats must be integers, we round to the nearest feasible integer solution.\n\nThe closest feasible integer solution is \\( (2, 2) \\), which gives a profit of:\n\\[ f(2, 2) = 4000(2) + 7000(2) = 8000 + 14000 = 22000 \\]\n\nThus, the optimal solution is:\n\\[ \\boxed{3 \\text{ boats of Type 1 and 2 boats of Type 2}} \\]"
