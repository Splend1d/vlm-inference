Two graphs are isomorphic if there exists a one-to-one correspondence between their vertices such that the adjacency of vertices is preserved.\n\nLet's examine each graph step by step:\n\n### Graph 1:\n- It has 8 vertices and 12 edges.\n- Each vertex is connected to 3 other vertices (degree 3).\n- The graph is a wheel graph with an additional edge connecting two non-adjacent vertices on the outer cycle.\n\n### Graph 2:\n- It also has 8 vertices and 12 edges.\n- Each vertex is connected to 3 other vertices (degree 3).\n- The graph is a complete bipartite graph \\( K_{4,4} \\) with some edges removed, but it still maintains the property that each vertex is connected to exactly 3 other vertices.\n\n### Graph 3:\n- It has 8 vertices and 12 edges.\n- Each vertex is connected to 3 other vertices (degree 3).\n- The graph is a cube graph, where each vertex represents a corner of a cube and each edge represents an edge of the cube.\n\nNow, let's compare the graphs:\n\n1. **Graph 1 vs. Graph 2:**\n   - Both have the same number of vertices and edges.\n   - Both have the same degree sequence (each vertex has degree 3).\n   - However, the structure is different. Graph 1 has a central vertex connected to all others, while Graph 2 does not have such a central vertex. This difference in structure means they are not isomorphic.\n\n2. **Graph 1 vs. Graph 3:**\n   - Both have the same number of vertices and edges.\n   - Both have the same degree sequence (each vertex has degree 3).\n   - However, the structure is different. Graph 1 has a central vertex connected to all others, while Graph 3 is a cube graph. This difference in structure means they are not isomorphic.\n\n3. **Graph 2 vs. Graph 3:**\n   - Both have the same number of vertices and edges.\n   - Both have the same degree sequence (each vertex has degree 3).\n   - However, the structure is different. Graph 2 is a modified complete bipartite graph, while Graph 3 is a cube graph. This difference in structure means they are not isomorphic.\n\nSince all three graphs have different structures despite having the same number of vertices and edges, none of them are isomorphic to each other.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n\\(\\boxed{A, B, C}\\)"
