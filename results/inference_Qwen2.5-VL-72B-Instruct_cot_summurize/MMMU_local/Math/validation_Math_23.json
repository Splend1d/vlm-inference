Let's denote the initial velocity of the rocket as \\( v_0 \\), the height of the tower as \\( h \\), and the time of flight as \\( t = 5 \\) seconds. The angle of projection is \\( 45^\\circ \\).\n\nFirst, let's break down the initial velocity into its horizontal and vertical components:\n\\[ v_{0x} = v_0 \\cos 45^\\circ = \\frac{v_0}{\\sqrt{2}} \\]\n\\[ v_{0y} = v_0 \\sin 45^\\circ = \\frac{v_0}{\\sqrt{2}} \\]\n\nThe horizontal distance traveled by the rocket is given by:\n\\[ x = v_{0x} t = \\frac{v_0}{\\sqrt{2}} \\cdot 5 = \\frac{5v_0}{\\sqrt{2}} \\]\nWe know that this horizontal distance is equal to \\( 3h \\):\n\\[ \\frac{5v_0}{\\sqrt{2}} = 3h \\]\n\\[ v_0 = \\frac{3h \\sqrt{2}}{5} \\]\n\nNext, we consider the vertical motion. The vertical displacement \\( y \\) after time \\( t \\) is given by:\n\\[ y = v_{0y} t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 \\]\nSince the rocket starts at height \\( h \\) and ends at height 0, the vertical displacement is \\( -h \\):\n\\[ -h = \\frac{v_0}{\\sqrt{2}} \\cdot 5 - \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 32 \\cdot 5^2 \\]\n\\[ -h = \\frac{5v_0}{\\sqrt{2}} - 400 \\]\nSubstituting \\( v_0 = \\frac{3h \\sqrt{2}}{5} \\) into the equation:\n\\[ -h = \\frac{5 \\cdot \\frac{3h \\sqrt{2}}{5}}{\\sqrt{2}} - 400 \\]\n\\[ -h = 3h - 400 \\]\n\\[ -h - 3h = -400 \\]\n\\[ -4h = -400 \\]\n\\[ h = 100 \\]\n\nTherefore, the height of the tower is \\(\\boxed{100}\\) feet."
