Here, I will use Kruskal's algorithm, which involves sorting all the edges in non-decreasing order of their weight and then adding the edges to the MST in that order, ensuring that no cycles are formed.\n\nFirst, let's list all the edges with their weights:\n\n- (2, 5): 8\n- (3, 5): 16\n- (1, 3): 5\n- (1, 2): 6\n- (3, 4): 11\n- (4, 5): 7\n- (4, 6): 15\n- (4, 8): 10\n- (5, 6): 4\n- (5, 7): 17\n- (6, 7): 12\n- (7, 8): 3\n- (1, 4): 14\n- (1, 8): 18\n- (2, 3): 2\n\nNow, we sort these edges by their weights:\n\n1. (2, 3): 2\n2. (7, 8): 3\n3. (1, 3): 5\n4. (1, 2): 6\n5. (4, 5): 7\n6. (5, 6): 4\n7. (2, 5): 8\n8. (3, 4): 11\n9. (4, 8): 10\n10. (3, 5): 16\n11. (5, 7): 17\n12. (6, 7): 12\n13. (1, 4): 14\n14. (1, 8): 18\n\nWe start adding edges to the MST while ensuring no cycles are formed:\n\n1. Add (2, 3): 2\n2. Add (7, 8): 3\n3. Add (1, 3): 5\n4. Add (1, 2): 6\n5. Add (4, 5): 7\n6. Add (5, 6): 4\n7. Add (2, 5): 8 (This would form a cycle with (2, 3) and (3, 5), so skip)\n8. Add (3, 4): 11\n9. Add (4, 8): 10\n10. Add (3, 5): 16 (This would form a cycle with (3, 4) and (4, 5), so skip)\n11. Add (5, 7): 17 (This would form a cycle with (5, 6) and (6, 7), so skip)\n12. Add (6, 7): 12 (This would form a cycle with (5, 6) and (5, 7), so skip)\n13. Add (1, 4): 14 (This would form a cycle with (1, 3) and (3, 4), so skip)\n14. Add (1, 8): 18 (This would form a cycle with (1, 4) and (4, 8), so skip)\n\nThe MST includes the following edges: (2, 3), (7, 8), (1, 3), (1, 2), (4, 5), (5, 6), (3, 4), (4, 8).\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n\\boxed{C}"
