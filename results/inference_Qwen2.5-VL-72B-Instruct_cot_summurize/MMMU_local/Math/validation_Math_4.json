From the graph, we can see that the maximum value is 1 and the minimum value is -1. Therefore, the amplitude is 1.\n   - This matches with all the given options since they all have an amplitude of 1.\n\n2. **Identify the period:**\n   - The period of a function is the length of one complete cycle. From the graph, we can observe that one complete cycle occurs over an interval of 2 units on the x-axis.\n   - For a sine or cosine function of the form \\( y = \\sin(bx) \\) or \\( y = \\cos(bx) \\), the period \\( T \\) is given by \\( T = \\frac{2\\pi}{b} \\).\n   - Setting \\( T = 2 \\), we get:\n     \\[\n     2 = \\frac{2\\pi}{b} \\implies b = \\pi\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the function must be of the form \\( y = \\sin(\\pi x) \\) or \\( y = \\cos(\\pi x) \\).\n\n3. **Determine the phase shift and vertical shift:**\n   - The graph starts at \\( y = 0 \\) when \\( x = 0 \\). This indicates that the function is a sine function because the sine function starts at 0 at \\( x = 0 \\), while the cosine function starts at its maximum value at \\( x = 0 \\).\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Based on the analysis, the function that matches the graph is \\( y = \\sin(\\pi x) \\).\n\nTherefore, the correct option is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{D}\n\\]"
