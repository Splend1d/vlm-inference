Quaternary structure refers to the arrangement of multiple polypeptide chains (subunits) into a single protein complex. Each subunit can have its own secondary and tertiary structures.\n\nLet's analyze the figure:\n\n1. **Regions A, B, and C**: These regions appear to be distinct parts of the protein structure. However, they are all connected within a single continuous polypeptide chain, as indicated by the continuous lines and the lack of any breaks or separations that would suggest independent subunits.\n\n2. **Continuous Polypeptide Chain**: The figure shows a single, continuous chain that folds back on itself to form the observed structure. There are no separate chains that come together to form the overall structure, which is a characteristic of quaternary structure.\n\n3. **Dashed Line**: The dashed line in the figure is likely used to divide the structure into regions for analysis or discussion purposes, but it does not indicate separate subunits. It simply highlights different parts of the same polypeptide chain.\n\nGiven these observations, the protein depicted in the figure does not have quaternary structure because it consists of a single polypeptide chain rather than multiple subunits coming together.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. False"
