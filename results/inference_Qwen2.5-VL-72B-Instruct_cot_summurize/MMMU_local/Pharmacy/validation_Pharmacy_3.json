In the diagram provided:\n\n- Step 1 represents the release of arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids.\n- Step 2 represents the conversion of arachidonic acid into prostaglandins via the COX enzyme.\n- Step 3 represents the conversion of arachidonic acid into leukotrienes via the lipoxygenase pathway.\n\nWhen NSAIDs inhibit the COX enzyme (Step 2), the production of prostaglandins is reduced. This can lead to an increase in the activity of the lipoxygenase pathway, resulting in increased production of leukotrienes (Step 3). The increased levels of leukotrienes can cause bronchoconstriction and other symptoms associated with an allergic reaction.\n\nTherefore, the step that, if blocked, is responsible for causing this drug allergy is **Step 2**."
