HCl is a strong acid, and when it dissociates in water, it produces hydrogen ions (H+) and chloride ions (Cl-). The concentration of H+ ions is directly proportional to the concentration of HCl.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\nA. [H+]: As the concentration of HCl increases, the concentration of H+ ions also increases. This would result in a linear relationship similar to the one shown in the graph.\n\nB. pH: pH is defined as the negative logarithm of the hydrogen ion concentration (-log[H+]). As the concentration of H+ increases, the pH decreases. Therefore, a graph of pH versus [HCl] would show a decreasing trend, not an increasing one.\n\nC. [OH-]: In pure water, the product of the concentrations of H+ and OH- is a constant (Kw = [H+][OH-] = 10^-14 at 25\u00b0C). As the concentration of H+ increases due to the addition of HCl, the concentration of OH- decreases. Therefore, a graph of [OH-] versus [HCl] would show a decreasing trend, not an increasing one.\n\nBased on the analysis, the quantity that might correspond to the y-axis on this graph is [H+].\n\nThe correct answer is: \\boxed{A}"
