This is a reduction because the oxidation state decreases.\n- **Boron (\\(\\text{B}\\))** in \\(\\text{NaBH}_4\\) changes from -3 to +3 in \\(\\text{NaBO}_2\\). This is an oxidation because the oxidation state increases.\n- **Hydrogen (\\(\\text{H}\\))** in \\(\\text{H}_2\\text{O}\\) remains +1 and does not change.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The hydrogen atoms in \\(\\text{NaBH}_4\\) are reduced.\n- The boron atom in \\(\\text{NaBH}_4\\) is oxidized.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n**C.
