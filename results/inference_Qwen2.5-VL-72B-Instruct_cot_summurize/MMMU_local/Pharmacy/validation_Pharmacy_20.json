Similarly, silicon, aluminum, and iron from the Earth's composition do not appear in the top five elements of the human body.\n\nTherefore, the only element that is abundant in both the human body and Earth's crust, oceans, and atmosphere is oxygen.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n**None of the options provided correctly list the common elements. The correct answer should be \"Oxygen\" alone.**"
