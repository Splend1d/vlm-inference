(4, 10)\n3. (6, 15)\n4. (8, 20)\n\nNow, let's calculate the ratio of the mass of iron to the mass of oxygen for each point:\n\n1. For the point (2, 5):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\text{Mass of iron}}{\\text{Mass of oxygen}} = \\frac{5}{2} = 2.5\n   \\]\n\n2. For the point (4, 10):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\text{Mass of iron}}{\\text{Mass of oxygen}} = \\frac{10}{4} = 2.5\n   \\]\n\n3. For the point (6, 15):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\text{Mass of iron}}{\\text{Mass of oxygen}} = \\frac{15}{6} = 2.5\n   \\]\n\n4. For the point (8, 20):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\text{Mass of iron}}{\\text{Mass of oxygen}} = \\frac{20}{8} = 2.5\n   \\]\n\nSince the ratio of the mass of iron to the mass of oxygen is the same (2.5) for all four samples, it indicates that all four samples have the same composition and are therefore the same compound.\n\nThus, the statement \"All four samples are the same compound\" is:\n\nA.
