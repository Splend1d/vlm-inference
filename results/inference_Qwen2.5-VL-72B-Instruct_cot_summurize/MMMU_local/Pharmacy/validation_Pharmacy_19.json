Sodium bicarbonate is a mild base and is often used to neutralize acids. In this case, it likely neutralizes any acidic byproducts or adjusts the pH. This step does not involve a chemical transformation that would show regioselectivity.\n\n### Step B: Treatment with NaN\u2083 and NH\u2084Cl\nIn this step, the mesylate group (OMs) is replaced by an azide group (N\u2083). The reaction is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2), where the azide ion (N\u2083\u207b) attacks the carbon atom bonded to the leaving group (mesylate). Since the azide ion is a good nucleophile and the mesylate is a good leaving group, the reaction will proceed at the carbon atom where the mesylate is attached. This reaction is not regioselective because there is only one possible site for the substitution.\n\n### Step C: Treatment with PPh\u2083 and NEt\u2083\nThis step involves the Staudinger reduction, where the azide group is reduced to an amine. The reaction proceeds via the formation of an iminophosphorane intermediate, which then hydrolyzes to form the amine. This reaction is not regioselective because it simply converts the azide group to an amine without affecting the rest of the molecule.\n\n### Step D: Treatment with MesSO\u2082Cl\nIn this step, the alcohol group (OH) is converted to a mesylate group (OMs) using methanesulfonyl chloride (MesSO\u2082Cl). This is a typical mesylation reaction where the mesyl chloride reacts with the alcohol to form the mesylate. This reaction is regioselective because it specifically targets the alcohol group and converts it to a mesylate, while leaving the rest of the molecule unchanged.\n\nTherefore, the regioselective reaction in the given sequence is **Step D**.\n\nThe answer is \\boxed{D}."
