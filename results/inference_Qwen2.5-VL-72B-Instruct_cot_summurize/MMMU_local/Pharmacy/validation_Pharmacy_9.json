The candies are organized and not scattered.\n- In image (b), the jar is tipped over, and the candies are scattered on the table. This indicates a lack of organization.\n\nGiven this analysis, image (a) appears to have more order because the candies are contained and organized within the jar.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\nA. a"
