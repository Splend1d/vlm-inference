Both types of cells remain blue-violet.\n3. **Alcohol-Acetone (Decolorizer):**\n   - Gram-positive cells retain the crystal violet-iodine complex due to their thick peptidoglycan layer.\n   - Gram-negative cells lose the crystal violet-iodine complex because their thinner peptidoglycan layer is disrupted by the alcohol-acetone.\n4. **Safranin (Counterstain):**\n   - Gram-positive cells remain blue-violet as they were not decolorized.\n   - Gram-negative cells, which have been decolorized, are stained red by safranin.\n\n### Filling in the Table:\n\n#### For Gram-Positive Cells:\n- **a. Crystal Violet:** Blueish-purple or violet (primary stain)\n- **b. Iodine:** Blueish-purple or violet (mordant)\n- **c. Alcohol-Acetone:** Blueish-purple or violet (decolorizer)\n- **d. Safranin:** Blueish-purple or violet (counterstain)\n\n#### For Gram-Negative Cells:\n- **e. Crystal Violet:** Blueish-purple or violet (primary stain)\n- **f. Iodine:** Blueish-purple or violet (mordant)\n- **g. Alcohol-Acetone:** Colorless (decolorizer)\n- **h. Safranin:** Red (counterstain)\n\n### Correct Answer:\nThe correct sequence for Gram-positive cells is:\na. Blueish-purple or violet (primary stain)\nb. Blueish-purple or violet (mordant)\nc. Blueish-purple or violet (decolorizer)\nd. Blueish-purple or violet (counterstain)\n\nSo, the correct choice is:\n**D. Blueish-purple or violet (primary stain), Blueish-purple or violet (mordant), Blueish-purple or violet (decolorizer), Blueish-purple or violet (counterstain)**"
