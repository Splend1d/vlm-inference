In the electrolysis of water, water (H\u2082O) is split into hydrogen gas (H\u2082) and oxygen gas (O\u2082) using an electric current.\n\nThe general reactions at the electrodes are:\n- At the cathode (negative electrode), reduction occurs, and hydrogen gas is produced.\n- At the anode (positive electrode), oxidation occurs, and oxygen gas is produced.\n\nIn the diagram:\n- Electrode A is connected to the negative terminal of the power source.\n- Electrode B is connected to the positive terminal of the power source.\n\nSince hydrogen gas is produced at the cathode (negative electrode), it will be produced at electrode A.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA.
