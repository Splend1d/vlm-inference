A straight line indicates a constant slope.\n\n- **Graph (B)**: This graph shows a horizontal line at y=4. A horizontal line has a slope of 0, which is also considered a constant slope.\n\n- **Graph (C)**: This graph shows a curve that starts high on the y-axis and decreases as it moves to the right. The slope of this curve is not constant; it changes as the curve bends.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n- Graph (A) has a constant positive slope.\n- Graph (B) has a constant slope of 0.\n- Graph (C) does not have a constant slope.\n\nTherefore, the graphs with a constant slope are (A) and (B).\n\nThe correct answer is:\nA. a,b"
