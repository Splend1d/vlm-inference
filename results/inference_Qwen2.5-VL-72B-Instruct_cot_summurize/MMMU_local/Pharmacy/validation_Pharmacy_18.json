This suggests that the drug's absorption is becoming less efficient with higher doses, which is not typical for active transport.\n\n2. **Graph 2**: This graph shows a constant AUC/Dose regardless of the dose. This indicates that the drug's absorption is linear and consistent with the dose, which is characteristic of first-order kinetics but not necessarily specific to active transport.\n\n3. **Graph 3**: This graph shows an increasing trend of AUC/Dose as the dose increases. This suggests that the drug's absorption becomes more efficient with higher doses, which can be indicative of active transport where the transport mechanism can become saturated at higher doses, leading to a non-linear increase in AUC.\n\nGiven that active transport can lead to a non-linear increase in AUC with increasing dose due to saturation of the transport mechanism, the most appropriate graph for transdermal absorption by active transport is:\n\n**C.
