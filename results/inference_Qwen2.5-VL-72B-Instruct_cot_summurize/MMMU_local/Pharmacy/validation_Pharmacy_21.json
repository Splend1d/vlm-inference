Let's analyze each statement to determine which one is untrue:\n\nA. **The chlorine groups are displaced before the drug becomes active.**\n   - This statement is true. Cisplatin works by displacing the chloride ions with water molecules, forming aquated species that can then react with DNA.\n\nB. **Intrastrand cross-linking of DNA results from the action of the agent.**\n   - This statement is also true. Cisplatin forms intrastrand cross-links primarily between adjacent guanine residues on the same DNA strand, which disrupts DNA function.\n\nC. **Base pairing between adenine and thymine is disrupted by the agent.**\n   - This statement is not entirely accurate. While cisplatin does affect DNA, it primarily targets guanine residues and forms cross-links between them. It does not specifically disrupt base pairing between adenine and thymine. Therefore, this statement is untrue.\n\nD. **The compound acts as a metallating agent.**\n   - This statement is true. Cisplatin acts as a metallating agent by forming covalent bonds with DNA, leading to its antitumor activity.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that is untrue is:\n\n**C. Base pairing between adenine and thymine is disrupted by the agent.**"
