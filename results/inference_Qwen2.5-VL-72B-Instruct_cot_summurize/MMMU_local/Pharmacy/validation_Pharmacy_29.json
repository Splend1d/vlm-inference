Determine the functional group and its position.\n3. Name the compound according to IUPAC rules.\n\nLet's analyze the structure step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the longest carbon chain:**\n   - The longest carbon chain in the given structure is 5 carbons long.\n\n2. **Determine the functional group and its position:**\n   - The functional group present is a ketone (C=O).\n   - The ketone group is located on the third carbon of the chain.\n\n3. **Name the compound according to IUPAC rules:**\n   - The base name for a 5-carbon chain is \"pentane.\"\n   - Since the ketone group is on the third carbon, it is named as \"3-one.\"\n\nCombining these, the IUPAC name for the compound is \"3-pentanone.\"\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nC. 3-pentanone"
