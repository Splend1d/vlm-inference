The mechanism of action for mitoxantrone involves its ability to intercalate into DNA and inhibit topoisomerase II, leading to DNA damage and cell death.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Topoisomerase poison**: Mitoxantrone inhibits topoisomerase II, which is an enzyme involved in the unwinding and rewinding of DNA during replication and transcription. By inhibiting this enzyme, mitoxantrone causes DNA damage and prevents cancer cells from dividing.\n\nB. **Metallating agent**: This refers to agents that form metal complexes with DNA or other cellular components. Mitoxantrone does not function primarily through metallation.\n\nC. **Chain terminator**: This typically refers to nucleoside analogs that terminate DNA synthesis by incorporating into the growing DNA strand and preventing further elongation. Mitoxantrone does not act as a chain terminator.\n\nD. **Antisense agent**: These are oligonucleotides designed to bind to specific mRNA sequences and prevent translation. Mitoxantrone does not function as an antisense agent.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**A. Topoisomerase poison**"
