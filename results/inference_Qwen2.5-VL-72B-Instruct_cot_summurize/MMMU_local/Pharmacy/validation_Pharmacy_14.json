This characteristic shape is indicative of certain types of bacteria known as spirochetes.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\nA. Neisseria gonorrhoeae - This bacterium is typically diplococcal in shape, meaning it appears as pairs of cocci (spherical cells). It does not have a spiral shape.\n\nB. Chlamydia trachomatis - This bacterium is intracellular and has a unique developmental cycle involving elementary bodies and reticulate bodies. It does not have a spiral shape.\n\nC. Treponema pallidum - This bacterium is a spirochete, known for its spiral shape. It is the causative agent of syphilis and matches the shape seen in the image.\n\nD. Haemophilus ducreyi - This bacterium is a Gram-negative rod and does not have a spiral shape.\n\nGiven the spiral shape in the image, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Treponema pallidum"
