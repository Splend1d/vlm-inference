This test will help us understand if the observed differences between the starting and ending cholesterol levels are statistically significant.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Calculate the Differences:**\n   For each individual, calculate the difference between the ending cholesterol level and the starting cholesterol level.\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Difference} = \\text{Ending Cholesterol Level} - \\text{Starting Cholesterol Level}\n   \\]\n\n   Let's compute these differences:\n   - \\(140 - 140 = 0\\)\n   - \\(230 - 220 = 10\\)\n   - \\(120 - 110 = 10\\)\n   - \\(220 - 240 = -20\\)\n   - \\(190 - 200 = -10\\)\n   - \\(150 - 180 = -30\\)\n   - \\(200 - 190 = 10\\)\n   - \\(300 - 360 = -60\\)\n   - \\(300 - 280 = 20\\)\n   - \\(240 - 260 = -20\\)\n\n2. **Summarize the Differences:**\n   Calculate the mean (\\(\\bar{d}\\)) and standard deviation (s) of these differences.\n\n   \\[\n   \\bar{d} = \\frac{\\sum \\text{Differences}}{n}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   s = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum (\\text{Difference} - \\bar{d})^2}{n-1}}\n   \\]\n\n   Where \\( n \\) is the number of individuals (10).\n\n   Sum of differences:\n   \\[\n   0 + 10 + 10 - 20 - 10 - 30 + 10 - 60 + 20 - 20 = -70\n   \\]\n\n   Mean difference:\n   \\[\n   \\bar{d} = \\frac{-70}{10} = -7\n   \\]\n\n   Standard deviation calculation:\n   \\[\n   \\sum (\\text{Difference} - \\bar{d})^2 = (0+7)^2 + (10+7)^2 + (10+7)^2 + (-20+7)^2 + (-10+7)^2 + (-30+7)^2 + (10+7)^2 + (-60+7)^2 + (20+7)^2 + (-20+7)^2\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = 49 + 289 + 289 + 169 + 9 + 529 + 289 + 2809 + 729 + 169 = 5231\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   s = \\sqrt{\\frac{5231}{9}} \\approx \\sqrt{581.22} \\approx 24.11\n   \\]\n\n3. **Perform the Paired t-test:**\n   The test statistic \\( t \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   t = \\frac{\\bar{d}}{s / \\sqrt{n}} = \\frac{-7}{24.11 / \\sqrt{10}} \\approx \\frac{-7}{7.62} \\approx -0.92\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the Critical Value:**\n   For a two-tailed test at the 5% significance level with \\( n-1 = 9 \\) degrees of freedom, the critical value from the t-distribution table is approximately \\( \\pm 2.262 \\).\n\n5. **Compare the Test Statistic to the Critical Value:**\n   Since \\( |t| = 0.92 < 2.262 \\), we fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThere is insufficient evidence to conclude that the cholesterol levels were significantly lowered after 12 weeks on a low-fat diet at the 5% significance level.\n\n**Answer: A. there is insufficient evidence to conclude that the medication lowered cholesterol levels after 12 weeks**"
