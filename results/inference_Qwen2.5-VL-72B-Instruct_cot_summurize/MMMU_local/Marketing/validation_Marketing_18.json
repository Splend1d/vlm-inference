This test is appropriate because we are comparing two related groups (work hours with and without breakfast).\n\nHere are the steps to calculate the p-value:\n\n1. **Calculate the differences between the paired observations:**\n   \\[\n   \\begin{aligned}\n   &\\text{Difference} = (\\text{Work hours with breakfast}) - (\\text{Work hours without breakfast}) \\\\\n   &8 - 6 = 2 \\\\\n   &7 - 5 = 2 \\\\\n   &9 - 5 = 4 \\\\\n   &5 - 4 = 1 \\\\\n   &9 - 7 = 2 \\\\\n   &8 - 7 = 1 \\\\\n   &10 - 7 = 3 \\\\\n   &7 - 5 = 2 \\\\\n   &6 - 6 = 0 \\\\\n   &9 - 5 = 4 \\\\\n   \\end{aligned}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the mean of the differences:**\n   \\[\n   \\bar{d} = \\frac{2 + 2 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 0 + 4}{10} = \\frac{21}{10} = 2.1\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the standard deviation of the differences:**\n   \\[\n   s_d = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum (d_i - \\bar{d})^2}{n-1}}\n   \\]\n   where \\( d_i \\) are the individual differences and \\( n \\) is the number of pairs.\n\n   \\[\n   \\begin{aligned}\n   &\\sum (d_i - \\bar{d})^2 = (2-2.1)^2 + (2-2.1)^2 + (4-2.1)^2 + (1-2.1)^2 + (2-2.1)^2 + (1-2.1)^2 + (3-2.1)^2 + (2-2.1)^2 + (0-2.1)^2 + (4-2.1)^2 \\\\\n   &= (-0.1)^2 + (-0.1)^2 + (1.9)^2 + (-1.1)^2 + (-0.1)^2 + (-1.1)^2 + (0.9)^2 + (-0.1)^2 + (-2.1)^2 + (1.9)^2 \\\\\n   &= 0.01 + 0.01 + 3.61 + 1.21 + 0.01 + 1.21 + 0.81 + 0.01 + 4.41 + 3.61 \\\\\n   &= 15.9\n   \\end{aligned}\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   s_d = \\sqrt{\\frac{15.9}{9}} = \\sqrt{1.7667} \\approx 1.33\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the t-statistic:**\n   \\[\n   t = \\frac{\\bar{d}}{s_d / \\sqrt{n}} = \\frac{2.1}{1.33 / \\sqrt{10}} = \\frac{2.1}{1.33 / 3.162} = \\frac{2.1}{0.42} \\approx 5.0\n   \\]\n\n5. **Determine the degrees of freedom:**\n   \\[\n   df = n - 1 = 10 - 1 = 9\n   \\]\n\n6. **Find the p-value using the t-distribution table or software:**\n   For \\( t = 5.0 \\) and \\( df = 9 \\), the p-value is very small, typically less than 0.001.\n\nGiven the options:\nA. 0.05\nB. 0.025\nC. 0.0004\nD. 0.0002\n\nThe closest value to our calculated p-value is:\n\n\\boxed{C. 0.0004}"
