Here, we are comparing the number of annual goals scored by teams in the Western and Eastern conferences.\n\nGiven that we are dealing with two independent samples (Western and Eastern conferences) and we want to compare their means, the most appropriate distribution for the hypothesis test would be the Student's t-distribution. This is because the t-distribution is used when the sample sizes are small and the population standard deviations are unknown, which is often the case in real-world data.\n\nLet's go through the options:\n\nA. The normal distribution: While the normal distribution can be used for large samples or when the population standard deviation is known, it is not the best choice here since we are dealing with small sample sizes and unknown population standard deviations.\n\nB. The Student's t-distribution: This is the correct choice because it is designed for small sample sizes and unknown population standard deviations, which fits our scenario perfectly.\n\nC. The uniform distribution: This distribution assumes that all outcomes are equally likely, which is not applicable here as we are comparing means of two groups.\n\nD. The exponential distribution: This distribution is used for modeling the time between events in a Poisson process, which is not relevant to comparing means of two groups.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n\\boxed{B}"
