We can see from the image that there is 1 yellow section out of these 8 sections.\n\nThe probability \\( P(Y) \\) is given by the ratio of the number of yellow sections to the total number of sections:\n\n\\[\nP(Y) = \\frac{\\text{Number of yellow sections}}{\\text{Total number of sections}} = \\frac{1}{8}\n\\]\n\nTo convert this fraction to a decimal:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{8} = 0.125\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the probability \\( P(Y) \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{0.125}\n\\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 0.125"
