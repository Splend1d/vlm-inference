Insect feeding\n\nThese outgrowths are characteristic of damage caused by the Emerald Ash Borer (Agrilus planipennis), an invasive beetle that feeds on ash trees. The larvae of this insect bore into the bark and cambium layer of the tree, disrupting the flow of nutrients and water, which can lead to the formation of these corky outgrowths as the tree attempts to heal the damage. This is a common sign of infestation by the Emerald Ash Borer."
