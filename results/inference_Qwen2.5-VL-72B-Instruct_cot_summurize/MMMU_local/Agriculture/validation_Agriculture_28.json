It has a very damaging impact on the health of the plant but localised to the place of infection.\n\nMistletoe is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of a host tree and taps into its vascular system to extract nutrients and water. While mistletoe can photosynthesize, it still relies on the host tree for some of its nutritional needs. This parasitic relationship can weaken the host tree, especially if there is a large infestation. The damage is typically localized to the areas where the mistletoe is attached, but over time, it can stress the tree and potentially lead to its decline."
