Yes, the fungi that make up the sooty mould family can be grown in culture.\n\nSooty mold is a general term for several species of fungi that grow on plant surfaces, particularly on leaves. These fungi feed on honeydew, which is a sugary substance excreted by sap-sucking insects like aphids, mealybugs, and scale insects. While sooty mold itself is not a single species, the various fungi that contribute to it can indeed be cultivated in a laboratory setting. This is often done for research purposes to study their growth patterns, interactions with other organisms, and potential impacts on plant health. The cultivation typically involves providing the appropriate nutrients and conditions that mimic the natural environment where these fungi thrive, including the presence of honeydew or similar substances."
