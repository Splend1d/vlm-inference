The orange pustules typically contain urediniospores, which are responsible for the spread and infection of the disease during the growing season. The black areas could contain teliospores, which are produced later in the season and are involved in the overwintering stage of the fungus.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Another spore type of the same fungus"
