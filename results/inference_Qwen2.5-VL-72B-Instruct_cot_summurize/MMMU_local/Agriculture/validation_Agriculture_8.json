This type of symptom is often associated with fungal infections, which can cause lesions and discoloration on leaves. \n\nGiven the options:\n\nA. Water mould infection - While possible, water moulds (oomycetes) typically cause more watery or soft rot symptoms rather than the dry, brownish spots seen here.\nB. Bacterial infection - Bacterial infections usually cause more distinct, often angular lesions and may have a different appearance.\nC. Don't know and don't want to guess - This is not a helpful answer.\nD. Fungal infection - This is a likely possibility given the appearance of the lesion.\nE. Nutrient deficiency - Nutrient deficiencies usually cause more widespread discoloration or deformities rather than localized spots.\n\nTherefore, the most probable reason for the blemish is:\n\nD. Fungal infection."
