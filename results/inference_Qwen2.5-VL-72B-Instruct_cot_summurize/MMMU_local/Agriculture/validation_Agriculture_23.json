This uneven distribution of symptoms suggests a localized issue rather than a systemic one affecting the entire plant.\n\nGiven the options:\n\nA. **Virus infection**: Viruses can cause mottling and discoloration, but they typically affect the entire plant over time rather than just isolated sections.\n\nB. **Herbicide damage**: Herbicides can cause localized damage if applied unevenly or if there is runoff affecting specific areas. The yellowing and dying of branches could be consistent with herbicide exposure.\n\nC. **Fungus disease**: Fungal diseases usually show more distinct lesions or spots and may not cause such localized yellowing without other visible signs like spots or mildew.\n\nD. **Phytoplasma**: Phytoplasmas can cause yellowing and stunting, but the symptoms are often more systemic and affect the entire plant.\n\nE. **Don't know, not sure**: This is always an option if none of the others seem to fit well.\n\nConsidering the localized nature of the damage and the fact that some branches appear to be dying while others remain healthy, the most likely cause is:\n\n**B. Herbicide damage**\n\nHerbicides can cause localized damage if applied unevenly or if there is runoff affecting specific areas, which matches the observed symptoms in the image."
