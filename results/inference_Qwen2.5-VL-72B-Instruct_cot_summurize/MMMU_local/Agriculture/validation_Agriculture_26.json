Phytoplasmas\n\nPhytoplasmas are a group of pathogens that can cause symptoms in blackberry plants that are very similar to those caused by glyphosate treatment, including \"little leaf\" symptoms. These symptoms can include stunted growth, yellowing leaves, and abnormal leaf development, which can be easily mistaken for herbicide damage."
