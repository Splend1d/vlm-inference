This occurs when a plant has outgrown its container and the roots start to circle around the inside of the pot, restricting further growth.\n\n2. **Leaves**: The leaves appear green and healthy, which suggests there might not be a mineral deficiency or nematode attack at this stage.\n\n3. **Overall Health**: The plant does not show any obvious signs of stress such as yellowing leaves, wilting, or other damage that would suggest a nematode attack or mineral deficiency.\n\nGiven these observations, the most likely issue is:\n\nE. Pot bound\n\nThe roots are showing signs of being restricted, which is typical for a plant that has outgrown its container."
