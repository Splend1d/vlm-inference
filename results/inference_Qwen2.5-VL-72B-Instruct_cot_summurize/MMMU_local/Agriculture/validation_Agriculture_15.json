Phytoplasmas are bacteria-like organisms that can cause various symptoms in plants, including the proliferation of shoots and leaves, leading to a broom-like appearance.\n\nGiven the options provided:\n\nA. Lack of nutrients - This is unlikely to cause such a specific and unusual growth pattern.\nB. Downy mildew (oomycete) - While downy mildew can affect maize, it typically causes leaf spots or blight rather than a witches' broom.\nC. Don't know, not sure - This is not a specific answer.\nD. Virus - Some viruses can cause similar symptoms, but they are less commonly associated with witches' broom compared to phytoplasmas.\nE. Phytoplasma - This is the most likely cause of the witches' broom symptom seen in the photograph.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nE. Phytoplasma"
