Fungal dieback ('ash dieback')\n\nAsh dieback, caused by the fungus Hymenoscyphus fraxineus, is a significant threat to ash trees in Europe and can lead to the withering and death of branches and leaves. The presence of green foliage on parts of the tree suggests that it is still partially healthy, but the withering branches indicate the presence of the disease.\n\nWhile other factors like repeated root damage by tractors or air pollution could contribute to the tree's decline, the specific pattern of withering branches is more characteristic of ash dieback. Therefore, option C is the most plausible answer based on the visual evidence."
