This is because the pathogen responsible for downy mildew, *Plasmopara viticola*, requires free water for its spores to germinate and infect the plant.\n\nGiven the options:\n\nA. Low temperature; low light - While these conditions can contribute to the overall environment conducive to fungal growth, they do not directly cause the presence of free water on the underside of the leaf.\nB. When free water has splashed up onto the underside of the leaf - This is the correct answer. Free water on the underside of the leaf provides the necessary environment for the spores of *Plasmopara viticola* to germinate and infect the plant.\nC. High temperature, high light - These conditions are generally not favorable for the development of downy mildew.\nD. High relative humidity - While high humidity can contribute to the overall environment conducive to fungal growth, it does not directly cause the presence of free water on the underside of the leaf.\nE. I don't know and I don't want to guess - This is not a valid answer as we have identified the correct condition.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. When free water has splashed up onto the underside of the leaf."
