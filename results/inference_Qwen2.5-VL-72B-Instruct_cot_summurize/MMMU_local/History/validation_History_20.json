The theory suggested that if one country in a region came under the influence of communism, then the surrounding countries would follow in a domino effect. The image shows a series of dominoes labeled with the names of U.S. presidents (Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon) and the last one labeled \"Ford,\" all set against a backdrop that suggests a tropical setting, likely referencing Southeast Asia.\n\nGiven this context, the image most directly supports the idea that U.S. foreign policy during the 20th century emphasized:\n\nA. stopping the spread of communism in Asia\n\nThis is because the Domino Theory was primarily used to justify U.S. intervention in countries like Vietnam to prevent the spread of communism throughout the region. The other options do not align as closely with the visual representation and historical context provided by the image."
