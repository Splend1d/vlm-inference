However, it does not specifically indicate that Muslim regions were more likely to expel Jewish people compared to others.\n\n2. **Protestant Regions**: The map does not highlight any significant expulsions from Protestant regions. The major expulsions shown are from Catholic regions like Spain, France, and England.\n\n3. **Catholic Regions**: The map clearly shows multiple expulsions from Catholic regions such as Spain (1492), France (1182), and England (1290). These expulsions were often driven by religious and political factors within Catholic-dominated areas.\n\n4. **Voluntary Migration**: The map primarily shows forced expulsions rather than voluntary migrations. While some migrations might have been influenced by economic factors, the primary focus of the map is on forced movements due to expulsions.\n\nGiven this analysis, the statement that best aligns with the map and historical context is:\n\n**C. Catholic regions were more likely to expel Jewish people than other regions.**\n\nThis is supported by the numerous arrows indicating expulsions from Catholic countries like Spain, France, and England."
