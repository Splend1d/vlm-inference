This event is most closely associated with the Trail of Tears, which was the forced relocation of the Cherokee nation.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. The Trail of Tears - This is directly related to the map, as it shows the routes of the forced relocation of Native American tribes, including the Cherokee.\n\nB. King Philip's War - This was a series of battles and raids between Native American tribes and English colonists in New England during the late 17th century. It does not involve the large-scale forced relocation depicted in the map.\n\nC. Creek War of 1836 - This war was part of the broader context of the Indian Removal Act and involved the forced relocation of the Creek people, which is similar to the events shown in the map.\n\nD. The Battle of Little Big Horn - This was a battle fought between the Lakota Sioux and Cheyenne tribes against the U.S. Army in 1876. It does not involve the large-scale forced relocation depicted in the map.\n\nGiven this analysis, the event that is least similar to the migration depicted in the map is:\n\nB. King Philip's War"
