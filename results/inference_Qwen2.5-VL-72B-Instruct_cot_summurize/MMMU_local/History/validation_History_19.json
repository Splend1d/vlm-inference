The wall did help deter invasions but was not solely responsible for preventing conquests.\n\nB. **The Han government built fortifications to protect the Silk Road.**\n   - The Silk Road was an important trade route, and fortifications along it were common. However, the primary purpose of the Great Wall was more broadly defensive rather than specifically for the Silk Road.\n\nC. **Monumental architecture served both a religious and a military purpose in the Qin and Han dynasties.**\n   - The Great Wall primarily served a military purpose. There is no significant evidence that it had a religious function.\n\nD. **Fortifications were built to project military power and defend against invasions.**\n   - This is the most accurate description. The Great Wall was constructed to project military strength and provide a physical barrier against invasions by nomadic groups.\n\nGiven this analysis, the most suitable answer is:\n\n**D. Fortifications were built to project military power and defend against invasions.**"
