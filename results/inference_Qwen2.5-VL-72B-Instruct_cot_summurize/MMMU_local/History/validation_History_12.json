Phillip II and Mary I:\n- Phillip II is the son of Emperor Charles V.\n- Mary I is the daughter of Catherine of Aragon and Henry VIII.\n- Phillip II married Mary I, making them related by marriage but not by blood (they are not siblings or cousins).\n\nB. Francis II and Mary Queen of Scots:\n- Francis II is the son of Margaret and James V.\n- Mary Queen of Scots is the daughter of Margaret and James V.\n- Francis II married Mary Queen of Scots, making them related by both blood (siblings) and marriage.\n\nC. Elizabeth I and Edward VI:\n- Elizabeth I and Edward VI are both children of Henry VIII.\n- They are related by blood (siblings) but not by marriage.\n\nD. Catherine of Aragon and Henry II:\n- Catherine of Aragon is the daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella.\n- Henry II is the son of Henry VII and Elizabeth of York.\n- There is no direct relationship by blood or marriage between Catherine of Aragon and Henry II as shown in the flowchart.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Francis II and Mary Queen of Scots"
