Carnegie did nothing to prevent the use of violence against his workers when they asked for better wages and working conditions.\nC. Carnegie was seen as the epitome of American success, but he was not even the richest man in America.\nD.

Carnegie did nothing to prevent the use of violence against his workers when they asked for better wages and working conditions.\n\nThis criticism is reflected in the cartoon, which shows Carnegie reducing wages while simultaneously engaging in philanthropy. The cartoon highlights the perceived hypocrisy of Carnegie's actions, where he is depicted as a tight-fisted employer who reduces wages but then uses the money saved to play the role of a philanthropist. This aligns with historical accounts of Carnegie's role during labor disputes, such as the Homestead Strike of 1892, where violent confrontations occurred between workers and management, and Carnegie was criticized for his handling of the situation."
