However, by the 18th and 19th centuries, the spice trade had declined in relative importance compared to other goods.\n\n3. **Ivory**: Ivory was traded but was not a dominant commodity in the context of British-Indian trade during this period.\n\n4. **Opium**: Opium became a crucial commodity in British-Indian trade, especially in the 19th century. The British East India Company monopolized opium production in India and used it to finance their tea purchases from China, leading to the Opium Wars.\n\nGiven the historical context and the prominence of opium in British-Indian trade during the 19th century, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Opium"
