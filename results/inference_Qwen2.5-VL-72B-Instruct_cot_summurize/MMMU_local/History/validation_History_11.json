The question asks which country among the options (Netherlands, France, Belgium, and Germany) would not have been similarly depicted as an imperial power prior to 1890.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Netherlands**: The Netherlands had significant colonial possessions, including the Dutch East Indies (modern-day Indonesia), Suriname, and various Caribbean islands. It was a major colonial power and could have been depicted similarly.\n\nB. **France**: France had a vast colonial empire, including Algeria, Indochina, and various territories in Africa and the Pacific. It was one of the leading colonial powers and could have been depicted similarly.\n\nC. **Belgium**: Belgium, under King Leopold II, acquired the Congo Free State in Africa. Although its colonial empire was smaller compared to Britain, France, or the Netherlands, it still had significant colonial interests and could have been depicted similarly.\n\nD. **Germany**: Prior to 1890, Germany was relatively new to the game of imperialism. It only began acquiring colonies in the late 19th century, after the unification of Germany in 1871. By 1890, Germany had started to build its colonial empire but was not yet as established as the other European powers mentioned.\n\nGiven this analysis, the country that would not have been similarly depicted as an imperial power prior to 1890 is:\n\n**D. Germany**"
