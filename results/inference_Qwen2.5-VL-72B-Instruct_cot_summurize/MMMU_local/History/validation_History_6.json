                    "text": "The image depicts a World War II era poster from the Soviet Union that calls on young men and women to defend their freedom, motherland, and honor. This portrayal of nationalism and the emphasis on defending one's country contrasts with Karl Marx's vision of communism.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **The Soviet Union saw communism as developing most effectively within a single country, while Marx envisioned it as an international movement.**\n   - This is correct. Marx believed in an international workers' revolution where the proletariat would unite across borders. In contrast, the Soviet Union under Stalin emphasized building socialism in one country, which fostered a strong sense of national identity and patriotism, as seen in the poster.\n\nB. **The Soviet Union saw communism as primarily a militaristic philosophy, while Marx argued for a peaceful approach.**\n   - This is not entirely accurate. While the poster does have a militaristic tone, Marx did not necessarily argue for a completely peaceful approach. He envisioned a violent proletarian revolution to overthrow the bourgeoisie.\n\nC. **The Soviet Union saw communism as being fully realized by 1917, while Marx predicted the proletariat revolt to occur much later.**\n   - This is incorrect. The Soviet Union did not claim that communism was fully realized by 1917. They were still in the process of building socialism and moving towards communism.\n\nD. **The Soviet Union saw communism as a theoretical concept, while Marx attempted to implement a communist society.**\n   - This is incorrect. Marx provided a theoretical framework, but he also supported and encouraged practical revolutionary actions. The Soviet Union attempted to implement a communist society based on Marxist theory.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n**A. The Soviet Union saw communism as developing most effectively within a single country, while Marx envisioned it as an international movement.**"
