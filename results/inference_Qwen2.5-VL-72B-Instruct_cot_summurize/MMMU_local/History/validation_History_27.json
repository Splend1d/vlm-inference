The map shows that the Han dynasty controlled a vast area with diverse geographical features, including mountains, rivers, and deserts, which would have posed significant challenges.\n\nB. **The Han dynasty established cities as centers for religious rituals and sacrificial ceremonies.**\n   - While the map does show several cities, it does not provide information about their specific functions related to religious rituals or sacrificial ceremonies. Therefore, this option is not the best explanation based on the map alone.\n\nC. **The Han dynasty imposed political unity where there had previously been competing states.**\n   - The map shows a unified territory with various cities and regions under control, suggesting that the Han dynasty successfully consolidated power over areas that may have been previously fragmented or controlled by different states. This aligns well with historical knowledge of the Han dynasty's efforts to unify China.\n\nD. **The Han dynasty failed to expand borders of previous Chinese dynasties.**\n   - The map shows that the Han dynasty controlled a large area, including regions beyond the Great Wall and extending into Central Asia. This indicates that they did expand beyond the borders of previous dynasties.\n\nGiven the analysis, the best explanation for the extent of the Han dynasty as shown in the map is:\n\n**C. The Han dynasty imposed political unity where there had previously been competing states.**"
