The capital of West Germany was located in East Germany.\n- This statement is true. The capital of West Germany (Federal Republic of Germany) was Bonn, which is located in the western part of Germany. However, Berlin, which was divided into East and West Berlin, had parts that were controlled by East Germany.\n\nB. West Germany experienced a postwar economic miracle.\n- This statement is true. West Germany did experience significant economic growth and prosperity after World War II, often referred to as the \"Wirtschaftswunder\" or \"economic miracle.\"\n\nC. Both East Germany and West Germany were allowed to rearm.\n- This statement is true. After the formation of NATO and the Warsaw Pact, both East Germany (German Democratic Republic) and West Germany (Federal Republic of Germany) were allowed to rearm as part of their respective military alliances.\n\nD. France had occupied West Germany.\n- This statement is not true. While France, along with the United States and the United Kingdom, occupied parts of Germany after World War II, these occupation zones eventually became part of West Germany. France did not occupy West Germany as a whole.\n\nTherefore, the statement that is NOT true regarding the divided Germany shown on the map is:\n\nD. France had occupied West Germany."
