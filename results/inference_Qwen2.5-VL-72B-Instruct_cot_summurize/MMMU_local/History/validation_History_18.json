Coercive Acts\n\nThe Coercive Acts, also known as the Intolerable Acts, were passed by the British Parliament in 1774 in direct response to the Boston Tea Party, which occurred in December 1773. These acts were designed to punish the Massachusetts colonists for their defiance and to assert greater control over the colonies. The Coercive Acts included the Boston Port Act, the Massachusetts Government Act, the Administration of Justice Act, and the Quartering Act."
