They were more about pooling resources for risky ventures like colonization and trade.\n\n**Option B: Colonists exported manufactured goods to Europe.**\n- This is incorrect because colonists typically exported raw materials (like tobacco, sugar, furs) to Europe, and Europe sent manufactured goods to the colonies.\n\n**Option C: Mercantilist policies were used to expand European economies.**\n- This is correct. Mercantilism was a dominant economic theory during the colonial era. It emphasized that a nation's wealth could be measured by its supply of precious metals and that colonies existed to serve the economic needs of the mother country. The map shows various European powers controlling different territories in the Americas, which aligns with mercantilist policies aimed at expanding their economies through control of resources and trade.\n\n**Option D: Trans-Atlantic trade increased as trade networks in the Indian Ocean basin declined.**\n- While trans-Atlantic trade did increase, there is no evidence from the map or general historical context that trade networks in the Indian Ocean basin declined as a direct result of the rise of these empires. In fact, Indian Ocean trade continued to be significant during this period.\n\nGiven this analysis, the best answer is:\n\n**C. Mercantilist policies were used to expand European economies.**"
