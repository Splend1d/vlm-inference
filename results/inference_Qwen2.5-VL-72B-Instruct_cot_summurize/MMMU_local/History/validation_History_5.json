Agrarian populations and their support for protectionist trade policies do not explain the delay in admission.\n\n2. **Control of those countries by the Soviet Union until the end of the Cold War**:\n   - During the Cold War, many Eastern European countries were under the control of the Soviet Union as part of the Eastern Bloc. This control limited their ability to engage freely with Western European countries and join international organizations like the EU. The fall of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War in the early 1990s opened up the possibility for these countries to pursue membership in the EU.\n\n3. **Resistance to the West by fascist governments in those countries**:\n   - Fascist governments were primarily a concern during World War II and were not a significant factor in the post-war period when the EU was being formed and expanded. Therefore, this option does not explain the delay.\n\n4. **The greater effect on those countries of the Great Depression and world wars**:\n   - While the Great Depression and world wars had significant impacts on all European countries, they do not specifically explain why Eastern European countries joined the EU later. The effects of these events were widespread and not unique to Eastern Europe.\n\nGiven this analysis, the best explanation for why countries of Eastern Europe were admitted later than other European Union members is:\n\n**B. Control of those countries by the Soviet Union until the end of the Cold War**."
