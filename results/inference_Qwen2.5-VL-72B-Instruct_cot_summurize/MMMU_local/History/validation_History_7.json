Batchelor from the New York Daily News is making the point that:\n\nA. although European individuals and countries might be seduced into waging another major war, the United States would be wise to avoid participating.\n\nThis interpretation is supported by the imagery and text in the cartoon. The figure labeled \"War\" is enticing a young European with the words, \"Come on in, I'll treat you right. I used to know your daddy.\" This suggests a cyclical pattern where the younger generation is being drawn into war, just as their fathers were. The sign \"Furnished Rooms To Let\" implies that war is offering a place for these youths, but it is a dangerous and destructive one. The cartoon implies that while Europe may be heading towards another war, the United States should remain cautious and possibly avoid involvement."
