As a result, the darker shaded areas record the most heavily traveled routes. Which of the following conclusions could be drawn from the evidence provided by this map?\n\nA. British ships did not sail along the west coast of Africa during this period.\nB. British ships did not sail the Atlantic Ocean during this period.\nC. British ships did not sail the Pacific Ocean during this period.\nD. British ships did not sail in the Indian Ocean during this period.\n"

Therefore, option A is incorrect.\n\n2. **Atlantic Ocean**: The map clearly shows extensive lines across the Atlantic Ocean, connecting Europe to the Americas. This indicates that British ships did sail the Atlantic Ocean. Therefore, option B is incorrect.\n\n3. **Pacific Ocean**: The map does not show any significant lines in the Pacific Ocean. The lines are concentrated in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. This suggests that British ships did not sail the Pacific Ocean as frequently or extensively as the other oceans during this period. Therefore, option C is correct.\n\n4. **Indian Ocean**: The map shows numerous lines in the Indian Ocean, connecting Europe to Asia and Africa. This indicates that British ships did sail in the Indian Ocean. Therefore, option D is incorrect.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct conclusion that can be drawn from the evidence provided by this map is:\n\n**C. British ships did not sail the Pacific Ocean during this period.**"
