The building appears to be a temple or monastery, and its integration with the natural landscape is a hallmark of Daoist philosophy, which emphasizes harmony with nature.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. **Daoism was supported by Chinese imperial rulers.**\n   - While this could be true historically, the image itself does not provide direct evidence of imperial support. It shows a temple but does not indicate any connection to the imperial court.\n\nB. **Daoist beliefs influenced much of Asia.**\n   - The image only shows a single location in China and does not provide evidence of influence beyond China. Therefore, this option is too broad based on the image alone.\n\nC. **Daoist temples often served as monasteries.**\n   - The image shows a temple-like structure that could serve as a monastery, but it does not definitively prove that all Daoist temples served this purpose. This option is plausible but not strongly supported by the image alone.\n\nD. **Daoism influenced Chinese architectural styles.**\n   - The image clearly shows a unique architectural style that integrates the building with the natural environment, which aligns with Daoist principles. This suggests that Daoism had an influence on the architectural design.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most appropriate assertion supported by the image is:\n\n**D. Daoism influenced Chinese architectural styles.**"
