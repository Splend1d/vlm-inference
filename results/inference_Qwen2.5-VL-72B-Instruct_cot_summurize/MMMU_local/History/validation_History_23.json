                    "text": "To analyze the 1933 political cartoon, let's break down the elements depicted:\n\n1. **Main Characters**: There are two main figures engaged in a physical struggle. One is labeled \"STRIKE-BREAKING,\" and the other is labeled \"UNION-BUSTING.\" This suggests a conflict between those who oppose strikes and those who oppose unions.\n\n2. **Supporting Characters**: Below the main struggle, there is a figure with a magnifying glass and a newspaper labeled \"PRESS,\" seemingly searching for evidence or clues. This implies an investigative role, possibly by the media or government.\n\n3. **Contextual Clues**: The title \"Strike-Breaking\" at the bottom reinforces the theme of the image, focusing on the efforts to undermine labor strikes.\n\nGiven these observations, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. **Infighting within and among unions prevented their rise to economic power**: The cartoon does not depict internal conflicts within unions but rather external forces opposing them.\n\nB. **Government inspectors turned their backs to illegal repression of labor unions**: The cartoon does not show government inspectors turning away; instead, it shows an investigative figure actively looking for evidence.\n\nC. **Attacks on unions were so well concealed that the government did not know where to begin its investigations**: The investigative figure with the magnifying glass suggests that the attacks are being investigated, implying they are not entirely concealed.\n\nD. **From their beginnings, labor unions were controlled by organized crime**: There is no indication in the cartoon that unions are controlled by organized crime.\n\nThe most fitting interpretation is that the attacks on unions were so well concealed that the government did not know where to begin its investigations. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. attacks on unions were so well concealed that the government did not know where to begin its investigations**."
