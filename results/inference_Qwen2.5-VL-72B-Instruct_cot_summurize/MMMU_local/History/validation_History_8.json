The map shows a voyage that starts from Lisbon, Portugal, and travels around the southern tip of Africa, passing through the Indian Ocean, and reaching Calicut in India.\n2. The path indicates a focus on navigating the coasts of Africa and Asia.\n3. The map does not provide information about other European nations or their activities.\n4. There is no indication of mass migrations to distant lands.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. **Portugal was primarily interested in exploration of the African and Asian coasts**: This is supported by the map, which shows a clear route along the coasts of Africa and Asia.\n\nB. **Vasco de Gama was the first European to embark on intercontinental travel by sea**: The map does not provide information about who was the first to do this; it only shows a route.\n\nC. **European nations began to look outward for economic opportunities**: While this might be true, the map specifically focuses on a Portuguese voyage and does not provide evidence about other European nations.\n\nD. **European began mass migrations to distant lands in the early sixteenth century**: The map does not show any evidence of mass migrations.\n\nThe most directly supported conclusion by the map is:\n\n**A. Portugal was primarily interested in exploration of the African and Asian coasts**."
