The relationship between the forces can be described by:\n\n\\[ F_b = F_i - \\frac{k_b}{k_b + k_c} F_e \\]\n\\[ F_p = F_i - \\frac{k_c}{k_b + k_c} F_e \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( F_b \\) is the force in the bolt.\n- \\( F_p \\) is the force in the plates.\n- \\( F_i \\) is the initial preload.\n\nFor the plates to remain in compression, \\( F_p \\) must be greater than zero even when \\( F_e \\) is at its maximum value of 8000 lb.\n\nSubstitute \\( k_c = 6k_b \\):\n\n\\[ F_p = F_i - \\frac{6k_b}{k_b + 6k_b} \\cdot 8000 \\]\n\\[ F_p = F_i - \\frac{6k_b}{7k_b} \\cdot 8000 \\]\n\\[ F_p = F_i - \\frac{6}{7} \\cdot 8000 \\]\n\\[ F_p = F_i - 6857.14 \\]\n\nTo ensure \\( F_p > 0 \\):\n\n\\[ F_i - 6857.14 > 0 \\]\n\\[ F_i > 6857.14 \\]\n\nSo, the minimum required initial preload \\( F_i \\) is approximately 6857 lb.\n\n### Part (b): Minimum Force in the Plates with Preload of 8500 lb\n\nNow, let's find the minimum force in the plates when the preload \\( F_i \\) is 8500 lb and the external load \\( F_e \\) fluctuates between 0 and 8000 lb.\n\nUsing the same relationship as before:\n\n\\[ F_p = F_i - \\frac{6}{7} F_e \\]\n\nWhen \\( F_e = 8000 \\) lb:\n\n\\[ F_p = 8500 - \\frac{6}{7} \\cdot 8000 \\]\n\\[ F_p = 8500 - 6857.14 \\]\n\\[ F_p = 1642.86 \\]\n\nSo, the minimum force in the plates is approximately 1643 lb.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n**B. 6857 lb, 1643 lb**"
