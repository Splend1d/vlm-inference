                    "text": "To determine the maximum shortening of the spring due to the impact, we need to consider the conservation of energy. The potential energy of the block at the initial height \\( h \\) will be converted into the potential energy stored in the spring at the point of maximum compression.\n\n1. **Calculate the initial potential energy of the block:**\n   The initial potential energy \\( PE_{\\text{initial}} \\) of the block is given by:\n   \\[\n   PE_{\\text{initial}} = mgh\n   \\]\n   where \\( m \\) is the mass of the block, \\( g \\) is the acceleration due to gravity, and \\( h \\) is the initial height. Since the weight \\( W \\) of the block is given as 5.0 N, we can find the mass \\( m \\) using \\( W = mg \\):\n   \\[\n   m = \\frac{W}{g} = \\frac{5.0 \\text{ N}}{9.81 \\text{ m/s}^2} \\approx 0.51 \\text{ kg}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the initial potential energy is:\n   \\[\n   PE_{\\text{initial}} = 0.51 \\text{ kg} \\times 9.81 \\text{ m/s}^2 \\times 0.2 \\text{ m} = 1.0 \\text{ J}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Set up the energy conservation equation:**\n   At the point of maximum compression, all the initial potential energy of the block will be converted into the potential energy stored in the spring. Let \\( x \\) be the maximum compression of the spring. The potential energy stored in the spring is given by:\n   \\[\n   PE_{\\text{spring}} = \\frac{1}{2} k x^2\n   \\]\n   The total energy at the point of maximum compression is the sum of the potential energy stored in the spring and the gravitational potential energy of the block at that point. However, since the block has come to rest at the maximum compression, its kinetic energy is zero. Therefore, the total energy is just the potential energy stored in the spring:\n   \\[\n   PE_{\\text{initial}} = \\frac{1}{2} k x^2 + mgx\n   \\]\n   Substituting the known values:\n   \\[\n   1.0 \\text{ J} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 90 \\text{ N/m} \\times x^2 + 5.0 \\text{ N} \\times x\n   \\]\n   Simplifying the equation:\n   \\[\n   1.0 = 45 x^2 + 5.0 x\n   \\]\n   Rearranging into standard quadratic form:\n   \\[\n   45 x^2 + 5.0 x - 1.0 = 0\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve the quadratic equation:**\n   Using the quadratic formula \\( x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\), where \\( a = 45 \\), \\( b = 5.0 \\), and \\( c = -1.0 \\):\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{-5.0 \\pm \\sqrt{(5.0)^2 - 4 \\times 45 \\times (-1.0)}}{2 \\times 45}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{-5.0 \\pm \\sqrt{25 + 180}}{90}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{-5.0 \\pm \\sqrt{205}}{90}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{-5.0 \\pm 14.32}{90}\n   \\]\n   Taking the positive root (since compression cannot be negative):\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{9.32}{90} \\approx 0.1036 \\text{ m} = 103.6 \\text{ mm}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the maximum shortening of the spring is approximately \\boxed{114.64 \\text{ mm}}."
