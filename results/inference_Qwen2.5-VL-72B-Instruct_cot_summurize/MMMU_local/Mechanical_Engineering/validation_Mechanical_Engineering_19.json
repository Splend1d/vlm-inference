The stiffness of each half is \\(2k\\) because cutting a spring into two halves doubles its stiffness.\n\nThe effective stiffness of the system when two springs are connected in parallel is the sum of their individual stiffnesses:\n\\[ k_{\\text{eff,1}} = 2k + 2k = 4k \\]\n\nThe natural time period \\(T_1\\) of a mass-spring system is given by:\n\\[ T_1 = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{m}{k_{\\text{eff,1}}}} \\]\nGiven \\(T_1 = 0.5 \\, \\text{s}\\), we can substitute the values:\n\\[ 0.5 = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{m}{4k}} \\]\nSolving for \\(m/k\\):\n\\[ 0.5 = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{m}{4k}} \\]\n\\[ 0.5 = 2\\pi \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{m}{k}} \\]\n\\[ 0.5 = \\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{m}{k}} \\]\n\\[ \\sqrt{\\frac{m}{k}} = \\frac{0.5}{\\pi} \\]\n\\[ \\frac{m}{k} = \\left(\\frac{0.5}{\\pi}\\right)^2 = \\frac{0.25}{\\pi^2} \\]\n\n### Step 2: Determine the stiffness of the springs in the second configuration\n\nIn the second configuration (Image 2), the original spring is cut into one-fourth and three-fourths of its original length. The stiffness of the one-fourth part is \\(4k\\) and the stiffness of the three-fourths part is \\(\\frac{4k}{3}\\).\n\nThe effective stiffness of the system when two springs are connected in parallel is the sum of their individual stiffnesses:\n\\[ k_{\\text{eff,2}} = 4k + \\frac{4k}{3} = \\frac{12k + 4k}{3} = \\frac{16k}{3} \\]\n\nThe natural time period \\(T_2\\) of the system is given by:\n\\[ T_2 = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{m}{k_{\\text{eff,2}}}} \\]\nSubstituting \\(k_{\\text{eff,2}} = \\frac{16k}{3}\\) and \\(\\frac{m}{k} = \\frac{0.25}{\\pi^2}\\):\n\\[ T_2 = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{m}{\\frac{16k}{3}}} = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{3m}{16k}} = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{3 \\cdot \\frac{0.25}{\\pi^2}}{16}} = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{0.75}{16\\pi^2}} = 2\\pi \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{0.75}}{4\\pi} = \\frac{\\sqrt{0.75}}{2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3/4}}{2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\approx 0.433 \\, \\text{s} \\]\n\nThus, the natural time period of the system in the second configuration is:\n\\[ \\boxed{0.433 \\, \\text{s}} \\]"
