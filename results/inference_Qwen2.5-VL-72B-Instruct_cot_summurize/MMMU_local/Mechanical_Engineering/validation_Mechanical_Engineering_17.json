The keyway is a rectangular groove that runs along the length of the shaft.\n\n2. **Locate the A-A Section**: The A-A section is indicated by the cutting plane line on the top view. This line shows where the cross-section is taken.\n\n3. **Analyze the Cross-Section**:\n   - The cross-section should show the circular shape of the cylinder.\n   - The keyway will appear as a rectangular cutout within the circular cross-section.\n\n4. **Compare with Options**:\n   - **Option A**: Shows a circular cross-section with a rectangular cutout, but the cutout is not aligned correctly with the keyway.\n   - **Option B**: Shows a circular cross-section with a rectangular cutout, and the cutout is aligned correctly with the keyway.\n   - **Option C**: Shows a circular cross-section with a rectangular cutout, but the cutout is not aligned correctly with the keyway.\n   - **Option D**: Shows a circular cross-section with a rectangular cutout, but the cutout is not aligned correctly with the keyway.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct cross-section that matches the A-A section is:\n\n\\boxed{B}"
