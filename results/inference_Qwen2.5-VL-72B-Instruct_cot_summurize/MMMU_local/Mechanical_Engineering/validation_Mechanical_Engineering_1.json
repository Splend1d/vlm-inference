This does not represent the circular hole.\n- **Option B**: This shows a semicircular shape on the left and right sides, which is not consistent with the full circular hole.\n- **Option C**: This shows a rectangular shape with a vertical line through the center and a circular hole in the middle. This matches the description of the cross-section.\n- **Option D**: This shows a circular shape with a vertical line through the center, but it does not show the rectangular shape of the prism.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct section is shown in Option C.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is \\boxed{C}."
