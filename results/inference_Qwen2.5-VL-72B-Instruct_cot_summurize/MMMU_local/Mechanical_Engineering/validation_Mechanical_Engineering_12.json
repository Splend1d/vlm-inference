The cylinder is on the left side, and the rectangular prism is on the right side.\n\n2. **Analyze the left view**:\n   - From the left side, the cylinder will appear as a circle.\n   - The rectangular prism will appear as a rectangle.\n\n3. **Compare with the options**:\n   - **Option A**: Shows a circle (cylinder) and a rectangle (rectangular prism) aligned horizontally. This matches the left view of the object.\n   - **Option B**: Shows a different configuration that does not match the left view.\n   - **Option C**: Shows a different configuration that does not match the left view.\n   - **Option D**: Shows a different configuration that does not match the left view.\n\nTherefore, the correct left view is shown in option A.\n\nThe answer is: \\boxed{A}"
