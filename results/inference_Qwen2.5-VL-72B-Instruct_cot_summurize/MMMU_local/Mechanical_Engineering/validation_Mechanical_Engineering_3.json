It shows a square with a smaller square cut out in the center.\n2. **Top View**: This is the view from above. It shows a square with a smaller square cut out in the center, but the orientation of the cuts is different from the main view.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option for the left view:\n\n- **Option (a)**: This view shows a square with a smaller square cut out in the center, similar to the main view. However, the cuts are not aligned with the top view, so this is not the correct left view.\n- **Option (b)**: This view shows a square with a smaller square cut out in the center, but the cuts are aligned with the top view. This seems to be the correct left view.\n- **Option (c)**: This view shows a square with a smaller square cut out in the center, but the cuts are not aligned with the top view, so this is not the correct left view.\n- **Option (d)**: This view shows a square with a smaller square cut out in the center, but the cuts are not aligned with the top view, so this is not the correct left view.\n\nTherefore, the correct left view is option (b).\n\nThe answer is: \\boxed{B}"
