This matches the description.\n   - **Option B:** Shows a different arrangement of lines and does not match the description.\n   - **Option C:** Shows a different arrangement of lines and does not match the description.\n   - **Option D:** Shows a different arrangement of lines and does not match the description.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct left view is shown in Option A.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: \\boxed{A}"
