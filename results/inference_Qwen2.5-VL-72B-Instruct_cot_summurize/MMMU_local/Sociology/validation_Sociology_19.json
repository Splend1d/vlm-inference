This concept is often applied in political contexts where policies and laws are determined by the will of the majority. However, majoritarianism can also be applied in other areas such as business, social groups, and even personal relationships.\n\nGiven this understanding, let's evaluate the options:\n\nA. True - Majoritarianism can indeed extend beyond political decisions to other areas of life.\nB. False - This would imply that majoritarianism is strictly limited to political decisions, which is not accurate.\nC. Not sure - This option suggests uncertainty, but based on the definition, we can be confident about the application of majoritarianism.\nD. None of the above - This would mean none of the provided options are correct, which is not the case here.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. True"
