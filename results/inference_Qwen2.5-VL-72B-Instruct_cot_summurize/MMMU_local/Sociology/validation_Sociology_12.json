Max Weber's work primarily aligns with the **Structural Functionalist** and **Symbolic Interactionist** frameworks, but he is most famously associated with the **Conflict Theory**.\n\n- **Conflict Theory**: Weber's analysis of social stratification, power, and authority (such as his concept of the \"iron cage\" and his study of bureaucracy) aligns well with conflict theory, which focuses on the role of power and inequality in society.\n  \n- **Structural Functionalism**: While not as central to Weber's work as conflict theory, some of his ideas about social structures and their functions can be seen as fitting within this framework.\n  \n- **Symbolic Interactionism**: Weber's emphasis on understanding individuals' subjective meanings and how they interact with others also has elements that fit within symbolic interactionism.\n\nGiven these points, the best answer is:\n\n**D. All of the above**\n\nWeber's contributions span multiple theoretical frameworks, making him a foundational figure in sociology."
