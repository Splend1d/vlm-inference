Refers to the particular experience of African Americans where in which they are forced to see themselves their status as citizens who are never able to escape identification based on the color of their skin.\n\nThis concept is known as \"double consciousness,\" a term coined by W.E.B. Du Bois in his book \"The Souls of Black Folk.\" It describes the internal conflict experienced by African Americans who must navigate two distinct identities: one as an American citizen and another as a member of a marginalized racial group. This duality forces them to constantly reconcile these two perspectives, often leading to a sense of being both an insider and an outsider in American society. The book cover you provided, \"Double-Consciousness and the Rhetoric of Barack Obama\" by Robert E. Terrill, explores this concept in relation to Barack Obama's rhetoric and its implications for citizenship."
