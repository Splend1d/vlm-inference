It attributes blame and suggests a specific solution without considering other perspectives or evidence.\n\nB. \"In 2003, states like Arkansas adopted laws requiring elementary schools to remove soft drink vending machines from schools.\"\n- This statement is factual and neutral. It simply reports an action taken by certain states without expressing any judgment or opinion about the effectiveness or appropriateness of the action.\n\nC. \"Merely restricting children's access to junk food at school is not enough to prevent obesity.\"\n- This statement expresses an opinion about the adequacy of a particular measure to address childhood obesity. It implies that more needs to be done, which is not value-neutral.\n\nD. \"Physical activity and healthy eating are a fundamental part of a child's education.\"\n- This statement expresses a belief about what should be included in a child's education. While it may be widely accepted, it still represents a value judgment rather than a neutral observation.\n\nBased on this analysis, the statement that best illustrates the concept of value-neutrality is:\n\nB. In 2003, states like Arkansas adopted laws requiring elementary schools to remove soft drink vending machines from schools."
