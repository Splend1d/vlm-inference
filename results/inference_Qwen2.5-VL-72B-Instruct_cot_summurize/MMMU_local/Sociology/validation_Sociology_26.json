The fact that a cell phone becomes outdated within a year or two of purchase is an example of **planned obsolescence**.\n\nPlanned obsolescence is a strategy where products are designed to have a limited lifespan, encouraging consumers to buy new versions more frequently. This can be seen in the rapid evolution of cell phone technology, where newer models with updated features are released regularly, making older models seem obsolete.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Planned obsolescence"
