It examines how people interpret their social world and how these interpretations shape their actions and behaviors. By studying the interactions between members at Occupy camps, a sociologist using this approach would look at how protesters communicate, form groups, and create shared understandings about their goals and strategies.\n\nWhile conflict theory (option C) could also be relevant as it deals with power dynamics and inequality, the specific focus on interactions and shared meanings makes symbolic interactionism the most appropriate choice for this scenario. Functionalism (option B) looks at how different parts of society work together, and ethnocentrism (option D) refers to judging another culture by the standards of one's own culture, neither of which directly addresses the interpersonal interactions within the Occupy camps."
