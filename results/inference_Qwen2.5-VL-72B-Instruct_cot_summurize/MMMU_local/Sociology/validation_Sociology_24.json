Weber argued that bureaucracies are inescapable due to their efficiency and effectiveness in organizing large populations, their value-neutral nature allowing them to be used for various purposes, and their reliance on expert knowledge for recruitment and decision-making.\n\nGiven these points, the correct answer is:\n\nD. All of the above are reasons why bureaucracy is inescapable\n\nWeber believed that bureaucracies are the most efficient form of organization for large-scale operations (A), operate without inherent values or morals making them adaptable to different ends (B), and rely on specialized knowledge and expertise for their functioning (C). Therefore, all these factors contribute to the inescapability of bureaucracies in modern society."
