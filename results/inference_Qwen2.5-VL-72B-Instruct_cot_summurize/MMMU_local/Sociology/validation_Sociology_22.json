The pyramid is divided into several levels, each representing different aspects of culture.\n\n- The bottom level includes items like food, clothing, and shelter.\n- The next level up includes transportation and communication.\n- The middle section includes government and economics.\n- The top section includes art and religion.\n\nGiven the options:\n\nA. Religion - This is represented in the top section of the pyramid.\nB. Prohibition against incest - This is not explicitly shown in the pyramid but is generally considered a cultural universal.\nC. Family - This is not explicitly shown in the pyramid but is generally considered a cultural universal.\nD. Media - This is represented in the middle section of the pyramid under communication.\n\nSince the question asks which is not a cultural universal as depicted in the pyramid, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Media\n\nHowever, if we consider the broader context of cultural universals, the prohibition against incest and family are also cultural universals, even though they are not explicitly shown in the pyramid. Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the pyramid alone is:\n\nD. Media"
