Her act of defiance against racial segregation laws is an example of a **conflict crime**.\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Conflict Crime**: This refers to actions that challenge or conflict with existing social norms, laws, or power structures. Viola Desmond's refusal to comply with the racially segregated seating policy was a direct challenge to the discriminatory practices of the time, making it a conflict crime.\n  \n- **Consensus Crime**: This typically involves acts that are widely considered harmful and are universally condemned by society, such as murder or theft. Desmond's action does not fit this category because it was a protest against unjust laws rather than an act universally seen as harmful.\n\n- **Social Deviation**: While her action could be seen as deviating from societal norms, the term \"social deviation\" usually refers to behaviors that do not conform to social expectations but may not necessarily involve legal consequences or challenges to power structures.\n\n- **Social Diversion**: This term is not commonly used in criminology or sociology in the context of describing types of crimes or social actions.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. A conflict crime**."
