This visual representation suggests a focus on the role of education in society and how it shapes individuals.\n\nThe theory that focuses on the labels acquired through the educational process is:\n\nD. Symbolic interactionism\n\nSymbolic interactionism emphasizes the importance of symbols, language, and social interactions in shaping individual behavior and identity. In the context of education, this theory would highlight how students acquire labels (such as \"smart,\" \"lazy,\" etc.) through their interactions with teachers, peers, and the educational system, which can influence their self-concept and future opportunities."
