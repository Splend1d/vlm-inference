Organic solidarity refers to the social cohesion that arises from the interdependence of individuals in more complex, modern societies where division of labor is prominent.\n\nGiven this context, the correct answer to the question \"What caused the shift from mechanical to organic solidarity?\" is:\n\nC. Division of labor\n\nDivision of labor leads to specialization and interdependence among individuals, which is the basis of organic solidarity. As societies became more complex and specialized, people relied on each other for goods and services, fostering a new form of social cohesion based on mutual dependence rather than shared values or beliefs (mechanical solidarity)."
