This theory does not directly address social stratification, which involves the hierarchical arrangement of groups based on power, property, or prestige.\n\nHowever, if we consider the options given and relate them to the broader context of social stratification, the statement that best aligns with the idea of stratification, albeit indirectly, is:\n\nC. Doctors earn more money because their job is more highly valued.\n\nThis statement reflects the concept of stratification by indicating that certain jobs (like doctors) are valued more highly in society, leading to higher earnings and status. This valuation is a form of symbolic interaction where society assigns meaning and value to different roles, influencing the distribution of resources and status.\n\nThe other options do not as clearly represent the concept of stratification:\n- A. While it mentions a gender pay gap, it doesn't fully capture the broader concept of stratification.\n- B. This is more about personal comfort and preference rather than societal stratification.\n- D. This is about specific challenges faced by teachers but doesn't broadly address stratification.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is C."
