The larger the vertical distance, the less successful the regression line is at predicting the value for that particular year.\n\nLet's analyze the graph step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the regression line**: The solid line in the graph is the least-squares regression line.\n2. **Identify the data points**: The black dots represent the actual number of injuries and illnesses reported per 100 full-time workers for each year.\n3. **Measure the vertical distances**: We need to visually estimate the vertical distance between each data point and the regression line.\n\nFrom the graph:\n- In 2003, the data point is very close to the regression line.\n- In 2005, the data point is also quite close to the regression line.\n- In 2007, the data point is slightly further away from the regression line.\n- In 2009, the data point is further away from the regression line.\n- In 2010, the data point is even further away from the regression line.\n\nBy comparing these distances, we can see that the data point for 2010 has the largest vertical distance from the regression line. Therefore, the least-squares regression line is least successful at predicting the number of injury and illness reports in 2010.\n\nThe answer is: \\boxed{E}"
