The matrix includes four strategies:\n\n1. Market Penetration: Selling more of existing products into existing markets.\n2. Market Development: Selling existing products into new markets.\n3. Product Development: Selling new products into existing markets.\n4. Diversification: Selling new products into new markets.\n\nAnsoff also proposed that companies should identify and develop a core competency to achieve sustainable growth. He identified four key components of his strategy:\n\n1. Have a clear concept of product and market alignment.\n2. Develop competitive advantage.\n3. Create synergy.\n4. Focus on strategic planning.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Have a clear concept of product and market alignment - This is one of Ansoff's strategies.\nB. Develop competitive advantage - This is another one of Ansoff's strategies.\nC. Create synergy - This is also one of Ansoff's strategies.\nD. Focus on product innovation - While product innovation is important, it is not explicitly listed as one of Ansoff's four key components.\n\nTherefore, the option that is not a strategy he developed is:\n\n\\boxed{D}"
