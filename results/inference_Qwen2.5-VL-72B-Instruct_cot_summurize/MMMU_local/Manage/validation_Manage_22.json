This is a necessary skill for HR professionals.\n\n2. **Become the link between human resources and organizational strategy**: This corresponds to the \"Strategic Partner\" role, which involves aligning HR strategies with the overall business strategy. This is also a necessary skill.\n\n3. **Optimize the value of employees**: This is related to the \"Employee Champion\" role, which focuses on advocating for fair pay and other employee-related issues. This is another necessary skill.\n\n4. **Be a change agent with a long-term vision for the organization**: This matches the \"Change Agent\" role, which involves driving organizational change and having a strategic focus. This is also a necessary skill.\n\nGiven that all the roles mentioned in options A, B, C, and D are essential according to the model, it seems there might be a misunderstanding in the question. However, if we consider the phrasing \"what is not something HR professionals must learn,\" the most fitting answer would be:\n\n**A. Manage human resources operations and infrastructure**\n\nThis is because while managing operations is important, the question might imply that this is more of a basic function rather than a strategic or advanced role that HR professionals must learn to remain relevant in the current business environment.\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n**A. Manage human resources operations and infrastructure**"
