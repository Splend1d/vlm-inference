The candidates we supported were defeated in more than two-thirds of the races we followed. The result is a harder battle to get policies that benefit our interests through the legislature, but it's also a budget issue. We can't continue throwing money at races we can't win, no matter how agreeable the candidate's stand on our issues may be. The fact that they share our viewpoints doesn't help if they can't get elected. How can we determine where it makes sense to invest? E-mail #2: E-mail from Legislative Consultant to Vice President of E.A.S.Y. Manufacturing and Staff Researcher: The demographic breakdown of elections where we supported the unsuccessful candidate can tell us a great deal. We've won only in one demographic, and our margin there is smaller than the margins by which we lost the others. <image 1> E-mail #3: E-mail from Staff Researcher to Vice President of E.A.S.Y. Manufacturing and Legislative Consultant: The demographic groups in which we lost are on track to become a majority of the U.S. electorate this century, and they vote. Right now, they make up 37% of the overall population and 28% of voters in the last election. By midcentury, we can expect the Hispanic population to rise from 17% to about 29% of the U.S. population, and Asian-Americans, now about 5%, will be about 9%. Our one successful demographic is the one whose share is declining. Now 63% of the population, non-Hispanic whites will be less than half of the population by 2050. Consider the following statement. Does the information in the three sources support the inference as stated? Statement: E.A.S.Y. Manufacturing supported candidates whose policy positions did not appeal to ethnic minorities.\n\nA. Yes\nB. No\n"

                    "text": "To determine whether the statement \"E.A.S.Y. Manufacturing supported candidates whose policy positions did not appeal to ethnic minorities\" is supported by the information provided in the three emails and the graph, let's analyze the data step-by-step:\n\n### Analysis of the Graph:\n- **Opponents**: \n  - White voters: ~40%\n  - African-American voters: ~90%\n  - Hispanic voters: ~70%\n  - Other (e.g., Asian, Pacific Islander): ~70%\n\n- **Our Candidates**:\n  - White voters: ~60%\n  - African-American voters: ~5%\n  - Hispanic voters: ~25%\n  - Other (e.g., Asian, Pacific Islander): ~25%\n\n### Key Observations from the Graph:\n- The opponents received significantly higher support from African-American, Hispanic, and other minority voters compared to the candidates supported by E.A.S.Y. Manufacturing.\n- The candidates supported by E.A.S.Y. Manufacturing received much lower support from these minority groups, with particularly low support from African-American voters (~5%).\n\n### Analysis of Email Content:\n- **Email #1**: Indicates that the candidates supported by E.A.S.Y. Manufacturing were defeated in most races, suggesting a lack of broad voter appeal.\n- **Email #2**: Highlights that E.A.S.Y. Manufacturing has won only in one demographic (presumably white voters based on the graph) and lost significantly among other demographics.\n- **Email #3**: Emphasizes that the demographic groups where E.A.S.Y. Manufacturing lost (Hispanic, Asian-American, etc.) are growing and will form a larger portion of the electorate in the future. Conversely, the demographic group where they succeeded (non-Hispanic whites) is declining in proportion.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe graph shows that the candidates supported by E.A.S.Y. Manufacturing had very low support from ethnic minority groups, while their opponents had high support from these groups. This suggests that the policy positions of the candidates supported by E.A.S.Y. Manufacturing did not resonate well with ethnic minorities.\n\nTherefore, the information in the three sources supports the inference that \"E.A.S.Y. Manufacturing supported candidates whose policy positions did not appeal to ethnic minorities.\"\n\n**Final Answer: A. Yes**"
