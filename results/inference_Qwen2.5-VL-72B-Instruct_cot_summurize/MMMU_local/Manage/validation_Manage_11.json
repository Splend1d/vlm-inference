Critics of stakeholder theory often point out certain limitations or drawbacks. Let's analyze the options given:\n\nA. **Vague**: Critics might argue that stakeholder theory can be vague because it does not always clearly define who the stakeholders are or how their interests should be prioritized.\n\nB. **Extra**: This term does not typically align with common criticisms of stakeholder theory. It seems out of context in this discussion.\n\nC. **Elusive**: Critics could argue that the benefits promised by stakeholder theory are elusive, meaning they are difficult to achieve or measure in practice.\n\nD. **Multidimensional**: While stakeholder theory is indeed multidimensional, recognizing various stakeholders and their diverse interests, critics do not typically argue that being multidimensional is a drawback but rather a characteristic of the theory.\n\nGiven these considerations, the option that is not considered by critics of stakeholder theory to be a benefit to stakeholders is:\n\n**B. extra**"
