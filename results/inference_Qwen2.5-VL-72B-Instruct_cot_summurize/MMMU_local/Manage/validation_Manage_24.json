We need to count the number of data points that lie exactly on this line.\n\nBy examining the graph, we can see that there are 3 data points that lie on the line \\( y = x \\). These points are approximately at (10, 10), (13, 13), and (16, 16).\n\nTherefore, the number of funds that have equal 3-year and 5-year returns is \\(\\boxed{3}\\)."
