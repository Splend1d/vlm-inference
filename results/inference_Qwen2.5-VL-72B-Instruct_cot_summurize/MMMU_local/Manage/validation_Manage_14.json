On an individual level, the model suggests that each person tends to have a 'preferred role,' a 'manageable role,' and a 'least preferred role.' When you understand your team members' preferred roles and align them with the team You can take full advantage of your team's strengths when the different stages they are in are connected. Belbin's team roles can be clustered according to three different directions.

Each cluster includes specific roles that contribute differently to team dynamics.\n\nLet's analyze the options given:\n\nA. **Action-Oriented Role**: This is correct. The image shows roles like \"Shaper,\" \"Implementer,\" and \"Completer-Finisher\" under this category.\n\nB. **Thought Role**: This is also correct. The image lists \"Plant,\" \"Monitor-Evaluator,\" and \"Specialist\" under the Thinking Roles.\n\nC. **Socially-Oriented Role**: This is correct as well. The image includes \"Co-ordinator,\" \"Resource Investigator,\" and \"Team Worker\" under Socially-Oriented Roles.\n\nD. **Catering to Customer Personas**: This option does not appear in the image or in the standard Belbin Team Roles model. It is not one of the three clusters described by Belbin.\n\nTherefore, the direction that is wrong is:\n\nD. catering to customer personas"
