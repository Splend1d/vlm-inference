The caption notes that many divergent ideas may not lead to anything productive.\n\nCritics often complain about the inefficiency and potential waste involved in the divergence phase because it can generate numerous ideas that ultimately do not contribute to the final product. This can be seen as \"wasteful and self-indulgent,\" especially if resources are spent on exploring ideas that do not yield results.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Disagreement is wasteful and self-indulgent"
