The candidates we supported were defeated in more than two-thirds of the races we followed. The result is a harder battle to get policies that benefit our interests through the legislature, but it's also a budget issue. We can't continue throwing money at races we can't win, no matter how agreeable the candidate's stand on our issues may be. The fact that they share our viewpoints doesn't help if they can't get elected. How can we determine where it makes sense to invest? E-mail #2: E-mail from Legislative Consultant to Vice President of E.A.S.Y. Manufacturing and Staff Researcher: The demographic breakdown of elections where we supported the unsuccessful candidate can tell us a great deal. We've won only in one demographic, and our margin there is smaller than the margins by which we lost the others. <image 1> E-mail #3: E-mail from Staff Researcher to Vice President of E.A.S.Y. Manufacturing and Legislative Consultant: The demographic groups in which we lost are on track to become a majority of the U.S. electorate this century, and they vote. Right now, they make up 37% of the overall population and 28% of voters in the last election. By midcentury, we can expect the Hispanic population to rise from 17% to about 29% of the U.S. population, and Asian-Americans, now about 5%, will be about 9%. Our one successful demographic is the one whose share is declining. Now 63% of the population, non-Hispanic whites will be less than half of the population by 2050. Consider the following statement. Does the information in the three sources support the inference as stated? Statement: The legislative consultant will actively lobby Asian-American legislators, because the candidates that E.A.S.Y. Manufacturing supported were more successful with Asian-Americans than with other minority groups.\n\nA. Yes\nB. No\n"

No\n\nThe information provided does not support the inference that the legislative consultant will actively lobby Asian-American legislators because the candidates supported by E.A.S.Y. Manufacturing were more successful with Asian-Americans than with other minority groups. \n\nHere\u2019s why:\n\n1. **Election Results Analysis**: The bar chart shows that \"Our candidates\" (those supported by E.A.S.Y. Manufacturing) performed poorly across all demographics, including Asian-Americans. The performance was particularly low among Hispanic and Other (e.g., Asian, Pacific Islander) voters, who showed very similar levels of support for \"Our candidates,\" both below 30%.\n\n2. **Demographic Trends**: The staff researcher notes that the demographic groups where E.A.S.Y. Manufacturing lost are growing and will likely become a majority of the electorate. However, this does not indicate that the candidates were more successful with Asian-Americans compared to other minority groups; rather, it highlights the importance of these growing demographics for future electoral success.\n\n3. **Current Success**: The legislative consultant mentions that E.A.S.Y. Manufacturing has won only in one demographic, which is not specified as Asian-Americans. In fact, the chart indicates that the highest support for \"Our candidates\" came from White voters, though still at a low level.\n\nTherefore, the data does not support the claim that E.A.S.Y. Manufacturing's candidates were more successful with Asian-Americans than with other minority groups, nor does it suggest that lobbying Asian-American legislators would be based on such success."
