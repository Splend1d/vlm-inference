Therefore, achieving performance levels required by the market is a result of innovation.\n\n2. **This product has ongoing sales value (Option B)**:\n   - Sustaining technologies, as shown by the solid line in the graph, continue to improve product performance over time, which can maintain or increase the product's sales value. Thus, having ongoing sales value is a result of innovation.\n\n3. **Customers are overserved (Option C)**:\n   - The graph indicates that sustaining technologies can lead to a situation where the performance exceeds what customers demand, especially at the high end of the market. This means customers might be overserved, receiving more performance than they need. Therefore, customers being overserved can be a result of innovation.\n\n4. **Customers receive additional value (Option D)**:\n   - While innovation can add functions and improve performance, it does not necessarily mean that all additional functions provide value to the customer. In fact, the graph suggests that at some point, the performance demanded by the market plateaus, indicating that further improvements may not add value but could lead to overserving customers. Hence, customers receiving additional value is not always a guaranteed result of innovation.\n\nGiven this analysis, the option that is not a result of innovation as shown in the graph is:\n\n**D. Customers receive additional value**"
