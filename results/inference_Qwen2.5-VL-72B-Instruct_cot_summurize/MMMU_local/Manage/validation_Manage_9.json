The store that averaged the most sales in May.\n\nThen, we will compare their total sales amounts for May.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the store with the fewest average daily sales in May\n\nFrom the \"Average number of daily sales\" column for May:\n- Ashford: 123\n- Bennington: 80\n- Carlisle: 52\n- Depot: 112\n- Eddington: 118\n- Farpoint: 95\n- Greenville: 151\n- Harrington: 100\n- Iverton: 66\n- Jackson: 143\n- Kiplinger: 110\n- Landfield: 115\n- Midville: 70\n- Northfield: 78\n- Overton: 103\n- Princeville: 92\n- Queensland: 118\n- Riverton: 131\n- Southland: 115\n- Tuxedo: 128\n\nThe store with the fewest average daily sales in May is **Carlisle** with 52 sales.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the store with the most average daily sales in May\n\nFrom the same column:\nThe store with the most average daily sales in May is **Greenville** with 151 sales.\n\n### Step 3: Compare the total sales amounts for May between these two stores\n\n- Carlisle's total sales amount in May: $465 thousand\n- Greenville's total sales amount in May: $508 thousand\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCarlisle (fewest sales) had lower total dollar sales ($465 thousand) compared to Greenville (most sales) which had $508 thousand.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **False**.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nB. False"
