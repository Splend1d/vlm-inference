The gel is placed in a buffer solution, and an electric field is applied. Proteins move towards the anode (positive electrode) because they are negatively charged due to the SDS.\n\n2. **Components of the Setup**:\n   - **Well**: This is where the protein samples are loaded.\n   - **Gel**: The medium through which the proteins migrate.\n   - **Buffer**: The solution that surrounds the gel and provides the necessary ions for the electric current.\n   - **Plastic frame**: Holds the gel in place.\n\n3. **Electric Field Direction**:\n   - The electric field is typically applied such that the cathode (negative electrode) is at the top and the anode (positive electrode) is at the bottom. This is because proteins, being negatively charged, will migrate from the top (cathode) to the bottom (anode).\n\n4. **Identifying the Anode**:\n   - In the diagram, the letter \"B\" is located at the bottom of the setup, which is consistent with the position of the anode in a typical SDSPAGE setup.\n\nTherefore, the letter that indicates the anode is:\n\nB.
