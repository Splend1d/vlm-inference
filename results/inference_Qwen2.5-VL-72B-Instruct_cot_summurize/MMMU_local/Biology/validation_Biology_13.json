                    "text": "To determine which statements are appropriate, let's analyze each statement based on the graph and our understanding of blood glucose regulation:\n\nI. **Normal homeostatic mechanisms maintain a glucose concentration of approximately 1 mg/ml.**\n   - The graph shows that the blood glucose level fluctuates around 1 mg/ml, with peaks and troughs. This suggests that the normal range for blood glucose is indeed around 1 mg/ml. Therefore, statement I is correct.\n\nII. **Glucagon is released at points A and C.**\n   - Glucagon is released when blood glucose levels are low to raise them. Points A and C are where the blood glucose level is decreasing, indicating that insulin is likely being released to lower the glucose levels. Therefore, glucagon would not be released at these points. Statement II is incorrect.\n\nIII. **The individual eats a meal at point D.**\n   - Point D is a trough in the blood glucose level, indicating a low level of glucose. Eating a meal would typically cause an increase in blood glucose levels, not a decrease. Therefore, statement III is incorrect.\n\nIV. **Insulin is being released at points B and E.**\n   - Insulin is released when blood glucose levels are high to lower them. Points B and E are peaks in the blood glucose level, indicating that insulin would be released to bring the glucose levels down. Therefore, statement IV is correct.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct statements are I and IV.\n\nThe answer is: **C. I and IV only**."
