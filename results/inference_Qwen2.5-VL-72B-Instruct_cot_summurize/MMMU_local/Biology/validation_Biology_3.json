This type of transport is often mediated by specific transport proteins that can also be influenced by other factors such as pH.\n\nHowever, the image does not directly show the transport of amino acids. The question asks about the effect of a decrease in extracellular pH on the transport of amino acids into the cell. \n\nIn general, changes in pH can affect the function of membrane proteins, including transporters. A decrease in extracellular pH could potentially alter the conformation of these proteins, affecting their ability to bind and transport substrates like amino acids. If the transporters involved in amino acid uptake are sensitive to pH changes, a decrease in pH might reduce their activity, leading to a decrease in the amount of amino acids transported into the cell.\n\nTherefore, the most likely answer is:\n\nB. decrease"
