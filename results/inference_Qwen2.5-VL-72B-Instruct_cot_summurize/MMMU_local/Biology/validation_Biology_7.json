A ribosome consists of two subunits: a large subunit and a small subunit. The large subunit is typically larger and more complex in structure compared to the small subunit.\n\nIn the image:\n- The large ribosomal unit is the larger, more complex structure.\n- The small ribosomal unit is the smaller, simpler structure.\n\nLooking at the labels:\n- Label B points to the larger, more complex structure, which is the large ribosomal unit.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB.
