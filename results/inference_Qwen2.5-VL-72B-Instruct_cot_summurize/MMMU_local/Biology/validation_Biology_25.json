Therefore, Species 1 is present below an altitude of 500 meters.\n\n2. **Species 2**: The abundance curve for Species 2 starts at an altitude of approximately 700 meters and peaks around 1000 meters. Therefore, Species 2 is not present below an altitude of 500 meters.\n\n3. **Species 3**: The abundance curve for Species 3 starts at an altitude of approximately 1500 meters and peaks around 2000 meters. Therefore, Species 3 is not present below an altitude of 500 meters.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Species 1 only"
