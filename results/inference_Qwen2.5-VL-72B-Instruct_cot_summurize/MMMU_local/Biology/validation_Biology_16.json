Ionic bonds form between metals (which tend to lose electrons) and nonmetals (which tend to gain electrons). \n\n- **Group 1** elements (e.g., H, Li, Na) are highly reactive metals that easily lose one electron to achieve a stable electron configuration.\n- **Group 17** elements (e.g., F, Cl) are highly reactive nonmetals that easily gain one electron to achieve a stable electron configuration.\n\nWhen a Group 1 element combines with a Group 17 element, the metal donates its valence electron to the nonmetal, forming a positive ion (cation) and a negative ion (anion), respectively. This results in a strong electrostatic attraction, leading to a strong ionic bond.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\n\nA. **Group 1 and Group 17**: This combination involves a metal and a nonmetal, which can form a strong ionic bond.\nB. **Group 1 and Group 14**: Group 14 elements (e.g., C, Si) are neither strongly metallic nor strongly nonmetallic, so they do not typically form strong ionic bonds with Group 1 elements.\nC. **Group 14 and Group 18**: Group 18 elements (e.g., He, Ne, Ar) are noble gases with full outer shells and do not readily form ionic bonds.\nD. **Group 1 and Group 18**: Noble gases in Group 18 do not form ionic bonds due to their stable electron configurations.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Group 1 and Group 17"
