It is not typically depicted in this manner in a cross-sectional view.\n\n2. **Fibular collateral ligament**: This ligament is located on the lateral side of the knee and connects the femur to the fibula. It is not typically shown in this type of cross-sectional view.\n\n3. **Tibial collateral ligament**: This ligament is located on the medial side of the knee and connects the femur to the tibia. In a cross-sectional view, it would be seen more towards the inner side of the knee.\n\n4. **Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)**: This ligament is located within the knee joint and runs from the anterior part of the tibia to the posterior part of the femur. In a cross-sectional view, it would appear as a band crossing the joint space.\n\nGiven the position and orientation of the structure labeled 164, it appears to be a ligament that crosses the joint space, which is characteristic of the anterior cruciate ligament.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nD. Anterior cruciate ligament"
