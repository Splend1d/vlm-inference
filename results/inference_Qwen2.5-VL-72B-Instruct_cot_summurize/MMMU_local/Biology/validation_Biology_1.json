The image shows a cross-section of the leg with various muscles and structures.\n2. Label 170 is located on the lateral side of the leg.\n\nGiven the options:\n- A. Tibialis anterior: This muscle is located on the anterior (front) side of the leg.\n- B. Tibialis posterior: This muscle is located on the posterior (back) side of the leg.\n- C. Flexor hallucis longus: This muscle is also located on the posterior side of the leg.\n- D. Peroneus longus: This muscle is located on the lateral (outer) side of the leg.\n\nSince label 170 is on the lateral side of the leg, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Peroneus longus"
