                    "text": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the structure of the plasmid and the effect of cutting it with the restriction enzyme HindIII.\n\n1. **Initial Form of Plasmid**: The plasmid pET28a, as shown in the image, is a circular, double-stranded DNA molecule. In its native state within the bacterial cell, it exists in a supercoiled form. This means that the DNA is tightly wound and under negative supercoiling, which is the most compact and stable form of the plasmid.\n\n2. **Effect of HindIII Digestion**: HindIII is a restriction enzyme that recognizes a specific sequence in the DNA and cuts both strands at that site. When HindIII cuts the plasmid, it introduces a single double-strand break in the circular DNA. This break converts the supercoiled circular DNA into a linear DNA molecule.\n\n3. **Resulting Form of DNA**: After digestion with HindIII, the plasmid will no longer be circular and supercoiled. Instead, it will be a linear piece of DNA with two ends where the cuts were made.\n\nGiven this information, the correct answer is:\n\n**E. Supercoiled to linear**\n\nThe plasmid changes from its supercoiled form to a linear form when cut with HindIII."
