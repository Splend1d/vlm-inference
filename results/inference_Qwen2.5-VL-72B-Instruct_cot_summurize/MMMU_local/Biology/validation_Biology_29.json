When starch is digested, it is broken down into smaller units, primarily maltose, which is a disaccharide consisting of two glucose molecules linked by an \u03b1-1,4 glycosidic bond.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. This structure shows a disaccharide with an \u03b1-1,4 glycosidic bond between two glucose units, which is the structure of maltose.\nB. This structure shows a disaccharide with a \u03b2-1,4 glycosidic bond, which is not the primary product of starch digestion.\nC. This structure shows a disaccharide with an \u03b1-1,6 glycosidic bond, which is not the primary product of starch digestion.\nD. This structure shows a disaccharide with an \u03b1-1,4 glycosidic bond, but it is not the correct orientation for maltose.\nE. This structure shows a disaccharide with a different type of glycosidic bond, which is not the primary product of starch digestion.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n\\boxed{A}"
