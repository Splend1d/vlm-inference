In other words, it is the fraction of genes that the two individuals share due to common ancestry.\n\nLet's break down the relationships step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the common ancestor**: The common ancestor for A and B is the individual at the top left corner of the chart (let's call this individual C).\n\n2. **Trace the lineage**:\n   - Individual A is the offspring of C and another individual (let's call this individual D).\n   - Individual B is the offspring of C and another individual (let's call this individual E).\n\n3. **Calculate the coefficient of relatedness**:\n   - Since A and B share one common parent (C), they are half-siblings.\n   - The coefficient of relatedness between half-siblings is 1/4.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of relatedness between individuals A and B is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}\\).\n\nSo, the correct answer is \\(\\boxed{C}\\)."
