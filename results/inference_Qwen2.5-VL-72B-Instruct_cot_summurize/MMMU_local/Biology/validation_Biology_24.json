The first image shows a stained section of tissue under a light microscope. The cells are stained with a purple dye, and the image appears to be a histological section. This is not characteristic of fluorescent microscopy.\n\nB. The second image shows a detailed view of cellular structures with different colors highlighting various components. The use of multiple colors and the clear distinction between different parts of the cell suggest that this image was likely produced using fluorescent microscopy, where different fluorescent dyes are used to label specific structures.\n\nC. The third image appears to be an abstract or artistic representation with colorful dots and lines. It does not resemble a typical microscopic image of heart muscle.\n\nBased on the analysis, the image that was produced by fluorescent microscopy is:\n\nB. <image 2>"
