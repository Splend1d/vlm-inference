Third degree atrioventricular block**\n\nIn third-degree AV block, there is complete dissociation between atrial and ventricular activity. The P waves occur at a regular rate, and the QRS complexes occur at a separate, slower, regular rate. This matches the pattern seen in the ECG. \n\nOptions A, C, and D do not fit the observed pattern:\n- First-degree AV block would show a prolonged but consistent PR interval.\n- Second-degree type II AV block would show intermittent dropped beats with a fixed PR interval.\n- Atrial flutter would show sawtooth flutter waves instead of regular P waves.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Third degree atrioventricular block."
