Given the clinical scenario of a patient who had an emergent hysterectomy due to inability to deliver the placenta and extensive hemorrhage, the most likely diagnosis is:\n\n**B. Placenta accreta**\n\nPlacenta accreta occurs when the placenta attaches abnormally to the uterine wall, either partially or completely, and fails to separate after delivery. This can lead to significant postpartum hemorrhage and may necessitate a hysterectomy if other measures fail to control the bleeding.\n\n- **Abruptio placenta (A)** involves premature separation of the placenta from the uterine wall before delivery, which would not typically result in the need for a hysterectomy due to failure to deliver the placenta.\n- **Chorioamnionitis (C)** is an infection of the fetal membranes and amniotic fluid, which would not explain the difficulty in delivering the placenta.\n- **Twin placenta (D)** refers to the presence of two placentas in a twin pregnancy, which is not relevant to the described clinical scenario.\n- **Partial mole (E)** is a type of gestational trophoblastic disease characterized by abnormal growth of the placental tissue, but it would not typically present with the described clinical picture.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is **B. Placenta accreta**."
