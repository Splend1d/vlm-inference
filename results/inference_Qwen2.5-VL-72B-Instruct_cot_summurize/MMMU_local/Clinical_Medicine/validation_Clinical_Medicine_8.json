A girl infant is born at 32 weeks gestation and is markedly icteric. The microscopic appearance of the placenta is shown here. Laboratory studies show the baby has a Hct of 18%, and an exchange transfusion is performed. Her first pregnancy was uncomplicated and resulted in the birth of a normal girl at term. Which of the following immunologic mechanisms is most likely to produce these findings? <image 1> \n\nA. Anti-receptor antibody\nB. Immune complex formation\nC.

This finding, along with the clinical scenario described, suggests an immune-mediated process affecting the fetus.\n\nGiven the context of hydrops fetalis, marked jaundice, and a low hematocrit requiring an exchange transfusion, the most likely underlying mechanism is **hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN)** due to maternal alloimmunization. In HDN, maternal antibodies cross the placenta and target fetal red blood cells, leading to their destruction. This results in anemia, jaundice, and potentially hydrops fetalis if severe enough.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Anti-receptor antibody**: This typically refers to antibodies that bind to specific receptors on cells, such as in Graves' disease where antibodies bind to the thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor. This is not relevant to the described scenario.\n\nB. **Immune complex formation**: While immune complexes can cause tissue damage, they are more commonly associated with conditions like systemic lupus erythematosus or certain types of glomerulonephritis. They do not typically lead to the specific findings seen in this case.\n\nC. **Complement-mediated cell destruction**: This is the correct answer. In HDN, maternal antibodies (often anti-D in Rh incompatibility) bind to fetal red blood cells and activate the complement system, leading to hemolysis. The chronic villitis seen in the placenta can also be a result of ongoing immune reactions involving complement.\n\nD. **Delayed type hypersensitivity**: This is a T-cell-mediated immune response, typically causing inflammation in conditions like contact dermatitis or tuberculosis. It does not fit the clinical picture of HDN.\n\nE. **Loss of self-tolerance**: This generally refers to autoimmune diseases where the immune system attacks the body's own tissues. While it can cause various pathologies, it is not the primary mechanism in HDN.\n\nTherefore, the most likely immunologic mechanism producing these findings is **C. Complement-mediated cell destruction**."
