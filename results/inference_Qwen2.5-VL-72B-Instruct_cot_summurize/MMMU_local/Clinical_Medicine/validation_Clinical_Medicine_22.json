Given the description that these lesions have not increased in size since childhood, the most likely diagnosis is:\n\n**D. Nevocellular nevi**\n\nNevocellular nevi, also known as moles, are common benign growths on the skin that typically develop during childhood and adolescence. They can vary in color from light tan to dark brown and can be flat or slightly raised. The fact that they have not changed in size since childhood is consistent with the behavior of stable nevi.\n\nHere's why the other options are less likely:\n\n- **A. Keratoacanthomas**: These are rapidly growing tumors that typically appear in adulthood and can resemble squamous cell carcinomas. They usually grow over weeks to months and then spontaneously regress.\n  \n- **B. Seborrheic keratoses**: These are common benign growths that typically appear in middle-aged and older adults. They are often described as \"stuck-on\" waxy or crusty bumps and tend to increase in number with age.\n\n- **C. Fibroepithelial polyps**: Also known as skin tags, these are soft, fleshy growths that hang from the skin. They are more common in areas of friction, such as the neck, armpits, and groin, and typically appear later in life.\n\n- **E. Epidermal inclusion cysts**: These are subcutaneous cysts that contain keratin. They are usually solitary, firm, and mobile, and can become inflamed or infected. They do not match the appearance of the lesions in the image.\n\nTherefore, based on the clinical presentation and the image provided, the most likely diagnosis is **D. Nevocellular nevi**."
