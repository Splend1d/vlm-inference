This is a common finding in conditions such as bowel obstruction or ileus.\n\n3. **Liver**: The liver is not clearly visualized in this radiograph, and there are no specific signs that would indicate an enlarged liver.\n\n4. **Spine**: The spine appears normal in structure and alignment, with no signs of abnormal enlargement.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most likely organ that appears abnormally large in this radiograph is the small intestines due to gas distension.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nB. Small Intestines"
