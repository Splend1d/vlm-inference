This is typically caused by a blood clot that travels to the lungs from another part of the body, most commonly the deep veins of the legs (deep vein thrombosis).\n\nGiven the options provided:\n\nA. Blunt chest trauma - While blunt chest trauma can cause various injuries, it is not a common direct cause of pulmonary embolism.\nB. Inhalation of inorganic dusts - This can lead to lung diseases like silicosis or asbestosis but is not directly related to the formation of pulmonary emboli.\nC. Prolonged immobilization - This is a significant risk factor for the development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which can lead to pulmonary embolism. Immobilization reduces blood flow and increases the risk of clot formation.\nD. Bronchopneumonia - While pneumonia can increase the risk of thrombosis due to inflammation and other factors, it is not as directly linked to pulmonary embolism as prolonged immobilization.\n\nTherefore, the most likely risk factor for the development of this woman's immediate cause of death, based on the image showing a pulmonary embolus, is:\n\nC. Prolonged immobilization."
