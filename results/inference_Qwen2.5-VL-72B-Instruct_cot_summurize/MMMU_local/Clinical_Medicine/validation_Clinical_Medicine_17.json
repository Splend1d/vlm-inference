A transbronchial biopsy is performed after she is hospitalized with respiratory distress. The microscopic appearance of the biopsy is shown here.

These findings are consistent with a chronic inflammatory process rather than an acute one.\n\nGiven the clinical history of recurrent symptoms associated with a specific environment (workplace) and the histological findings, the most likely diagnosis is:\n\n**B. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis**\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP)**: This condition is characterized by an immune response to inhaled organic dusts or antigens, often leading to recurrent episodes of symptoms like fever, cough, and dyspnea. The symptoms typically improve when the patient is away from the exposure source. Histologically, HP can show interstitial inflammation with lymphocytes and plasma cells, and sometimes non-caseating granulomas, which aligns with the image provided.\n  \n- **Influenza viral pneumonia**: Typically presents with more acute and severe symptoms and would not show the chronic inflammatory changes seen in the image.\n  \n- **Diffuse alveolar damage (DAD)**: Seen in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), it usually presents with extensive alveolar damage and hyaline membranes, which are not evident in this image.\n  \n- **Miliary tuberculosis**: Characterized by numerous small granulomas disseminated throughout the lung parenchyma, often with caseation necrosis. While granulomas may be present in HP, the overall pattern and clinical presentation do not suggest miliary TB.\n\nTherefore, based on both the clinical scenario and the histological findings, **hypersensitivity pneumonitis** is the most appropriate diagnosis."
