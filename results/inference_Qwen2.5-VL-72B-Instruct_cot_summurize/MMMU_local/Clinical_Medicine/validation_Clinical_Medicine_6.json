Given the clinical scenario described, where the patient experienced a cardiac arrest and underwent prolonged resuscitation, the most likely cellular change occurring in the myocardium at this stage would be:\n\n**B. Free radical injury**\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Free Radical Injury:** During cardiac arrest and subsequent reperfusion (when blood flow is restored), there is a significant production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) or free radicals. These free radicals can cause extensive damage to cell membranes, proteins, and DNA, leading to further cell death even after the initial ischemic insult has been resolved. This phenomenon is known as \"reperfusion injury.\"\n\n### Other Options:\n- **A. Apoptosis:** While apoptosis (programmed cell death) can occur in response to ischemia, it typically takes longer to develop compared to the immediate effects of free radical injury during reperfusion.\n- **C. Heterophagocytosis:** This refers to the ingestion of foreign material by phagocytes. It is not a primary process in the immediate aftermath of cardiac arrest and reperfusion.\n- **D. Squamous Metaplasia:** This is a type of cellular adaptation where one differentiated cell type is replaced by another. It is not relevant to the acute phase of myocardial injury following cardiac arrest.\n\nTherefore, given the context of the case and the image, the most appropriate answer is **B. Free radical injury**."
