On physical examination the skin overlying the breast is indurated, roughened, and reddish-orange. There is nipple retraction. The gross appearance of the cut surface of her subsequent mastectomy specimen is shown here. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? <image 1> \n\nA. Infiltrating ductal carcinoma\nB.

This presentation, along with the clinical description of indurated, roughened, and reddish-orange skin overlying the breast and nipple retraction, is highly suggestive of inflammatory breast cancer (IBC). However, IBC is not listed as an option.\n\nGiven the options provided, the most likely diagnosis is:\n\n**A. Infiltrating ductal carcinoma**\n\nInfiltrating ductal carcinoma can present with features similar to those described, especially if it has an extensive intraductal component or if it involves the lymphatics, leading to skin changes such as peau d'orange (resembling the skin of an orange peel) and nipple retraction. The diffuse involvement seen in the image is consistent with an infiltrating ductal carcinoma rather than the other options listed:\n\n- **B. Intraductal carcinoma**: Typically presents as a non-invasive lesion and would not cause such extensive skin changes.\n- **C. Phyllodes tumor**: Usually presents as a well-circumscribed mass and does not typically cause the skin changes described.\n- **D. Lobular carcinoma in situ**: Is a non-invasive condition and would not cause the clinical and gross findings described.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is A. Infiltrating ductal carcinoma."
