This narrowing occurs due to the wearing down of cartilage.\n\n2. **Bone Spurring (Osteophytes)**: There appear to be bony outgrowths at the edges of the joint, which are characteristic of osteoarthritis.\n\n3. **Subchondral Sclerosis**: There might be areas of increased bone density just beneath the cartilage, another feature often seen in osteoarthritis.\n\n4. **No Erosions**: There are no apparent erosions or deformities that would suggest rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n5. **No Signs of Infection**: There are no signs such as soft tissue swelling or bone destruction that would indicate septic arthritis.\n\n6. **No Evidence of Avascular Necrosis**: There are no signs of bone death or collapse that would suggest avascular necrosis.\n\nGiven these observations, the most likely diagnosis is:\n\n**A. Osteoarthritis**\n\nThis condition is characterized by the degeneration of joint cartilage and the underlying bone, leading to pain, stiffness, and reduced function of the affected joints. The X-ray findings are consistent with this diagnosis."
