The image does not prominently display these features.\n\n2. **Small Bowel Obstruction**: This condition usually shows multiple dilated small bowel loops with air-fluid levels. The image appears to have several dilated loops, which could be indicative of this condition.\n\n3. **Generalized Ileus**: This would show diffuse gas throughout the bowel without distinct air-fluid levels and often with a paucity of gas in the distal colon. The image does not clearly show this pattern.\n\n4. **Localized Ileus**: This would show localized dilation of bowel loops in a specific area. The image suggests more generalized dilation rather than localized.\n\nGiven the presence of multiple dilated loops that appear to be small bowel, the most likely diagnosis is:\n\n**B. Small bowel obstruction**."
