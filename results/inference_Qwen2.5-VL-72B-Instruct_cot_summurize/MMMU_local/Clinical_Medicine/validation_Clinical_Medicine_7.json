At 37 weeks she has the sudden onset of pelvic pain accompanied by passage of blood per vagina. Her membranes have not ruptured nor is she having labor contractions. Fetal monitoring reveals that the baby is in distress, and an emergent cesarean section is performed. The gross appearance of the placenta is shown here.

This condition occurs when the placenta separates from the uterine wall before delivery, leading to bleeding and potential fetal distress.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Ectopic pregnancy**: This involves implantation of the embryo outside the uterus, typically in the fallopian tube. It would not present with a placenta as shown in the image.\n\nB. **Placenta previa**: This condition involves the placenta covering the cervical os. While it can cause vaginal bleeding, it does not involve the separation and hemorrhage seen in the image.\n\nC. **Placenta accreta**: This involves abnormal adherence of the placenta to the uterine wall, but it does not typically present with the type of hemorrhagic separation seen here.\n\nD. **Molar pregnancy**: This is a type of gestational trophoblastic disease where the placenta develops into a mass of cysts. The image does not show the characteristic vesicular appearance of a molar pregnancy.\n\nE. **Abruptio placenta**: This is the correct answer. It involves premature separation of the placenta from the uterine wall, leading to bleeding and fetal distress, which matches the clinical presentation and the appearance of the placenta in the image.\n\nF. **Pregnancy-induced hypertension**: While this can lead to complications, it does not directly cause the type of placental separation and hemorrhage seen in the image.\n\nTherefore, the most likely diagnosis is **E. Abruptio placenta**."
