Taste buds are primarily located on the papillae, which are the small bumps on the surface of the tongue. The image shows different regions of the tongue, and the areas with more visible papillae are likely to have more taste buds.\n\n- Region 1: This area appears to have fewer papillae.\n- Region 2: This area has some papillae but not as many as region 3.\n- Region 3: This area has a significant number of papillae, indicating a higher concentration of taste buds.\n- Region 4: This area also has a significant number of papillae, similar to region 3.\n\nGiven this information, a loss of taste would be most expected in the regions with the highest concentration of taste buds, which are regions 3 and 4.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 3 and 4"
