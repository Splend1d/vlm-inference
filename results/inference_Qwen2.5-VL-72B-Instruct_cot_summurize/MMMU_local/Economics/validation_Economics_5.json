This results in higher output (rY) and higher price levels compared to the initial equilibrium point A.\n\n2. **Flexible Wages**: Flexible wages imply that wages can adjust upwards or downwards in response to changes in the labor market conditions.\n\n3. **Return to Long-Run Equilibrium**:\n   - When there is a boom, the economy moves to a new short-run equilibrium where the price level is higher than the long-run equilibrium price level.\n   - In the long run, higher prices lead to higher costs for firms. If wages are flexible, they will adjust to reflect the higher price level.\n   - As wages rise, the cost of production increases, which shifts the short-run aggregate supply (SRAS) curve to the left.\n   - The leftward shift of the SRAS curve reduces the output back towards the long-run aggregate supply (LRAS) curve, bringing the economy back to its long-run equilibrium.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Wages will rise."
