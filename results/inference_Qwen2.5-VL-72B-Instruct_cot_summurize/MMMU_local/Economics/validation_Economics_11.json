This suggests economies of scale, where larger production volumes lead to lower costs per unit.\n\n2. **Size of the Market**: The vertical red dashed line labeled \"Size of the market\" indicates the maximum quantity that can be sold in the market.\n\n3. **Economies of Scale and Monopoly**: If the AC curve continues to decrease even beyond the size of the market, it implies that there are increasing returns to scale. This means that a single firm can produce at a lower average cost than multiple smaller firms combined. As a result, it becomes more efficient for one large firm to dominate the market rather than having several smaller firms competing.\n\nGiven these points, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. There are increasing returns to scale well beyond the size of the market.**\n\nThis condition supports the existence of a monopoly because a single firm can achieve lower average costs by producing at a larger scale, making it difficult for other firms to compete effectively."
