If \\(a\\) increases:\n   - The intercept of the consumption line with the vertical axis will increase.\n   - This means the entire consumption line will shift upwards.\n\n2. **Parameter \\(b\\)**: This is the marginal propensity to consume (MPC), which represents the change in consumption for a unit change in income. If \\(b\\) increases:\n   - The slope of the consumption line will increase.\n   - This means the consumption line will get steeper.\n\nGiven these points, let's evaluate the options:\n\n- **Option A**: \"C shifts upwards.\" This is correct for an increase in \\(a\\), but it doesn't address the effect of an increase in \\(b\\).\n- **Option B**: \"(1)C shifts downwards. (2) C gets gentler.\" This is incorrect because an increase in \\(a\\) should shift the line upwards, not downwards, and an increase in \\(b\\) should make the line steeper, not gentler.\n- **Option C**: \"(1)C gets steeper. (2) C gets gentler.\" This is incorrect because an increase in \\(a\\) affects the intercept, not the slope, and an increase in \\(b\\) makes the line steeper, not gentler.\n- **Option D**: \"(1)C shifts downwards. (2) C gets steeper.\" This is incorrect because an increase in \\(a\\) should shift the line upwards, not downwards.\n\nThe correct answer is that an increase in \\(a\\) shifts the consumption line upwards, and an increase in \\(b\\) makes the consumption line steeper. Therefore, the correct choice is:\n\n\\boxed{A}"
