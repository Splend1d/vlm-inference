The equilibrium price is where the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied.\n\nFrom the table:\n- At $6, Quantity Demanded = 81 pizzas and Quantity Supplied = 81 pizzas.\n\nSo, the equilibrium price is $6.\n\nNow, let's consider what happens if the actual price is above the equilibrium price, say at $7:\n- At $7, Quantity Demanded = 68 pizzas and Quantity Supplied = 98 pizzas.\n- There is an excess supply of 98 - 68 = 30 pizzas.\n\nWhen there is excess supply (also known as a surplus), suppliers will lower their prices to sell the excess inventory. As the price decreases, the quantity demanded will increase and the quantity supplied will decrease, moving the market back toward the equilibrium price.\n\nTherefore, if the actual price in this market were above the equilibrium price, excess supply would drive the market toward the equilibrium.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nA. excess supply"
