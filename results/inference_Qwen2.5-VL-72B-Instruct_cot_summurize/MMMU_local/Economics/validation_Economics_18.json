The LRAS curve represents the economy's potential output when all resources are fully employed and technology is constant.\n\nIn the given graph, the LRAS curve shifts to the right from LRAS1 to LRAS2, indicating an increase in the economy's potential output (Real GDP).\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Increase in capital**: An increase in capital, such as more machinery, equipment, or infrastructure, would enhance the productive capacity of the economy. This would lead to an increase in potential output, shifting the LRAS curve to the right. This matches the observed shift from LRAS1 to LRAS2.\n\nB. **Decrease in labor**: A decrease in labor would reduce the number of workers available to produce goods and services, thereby decreasing the economy's potential output. This would shift the LRAS curve to the left, not to the right.\n\nC. **Decrease in human capital**: A decrease in human capital, which refers to the skills, knowledge, and experience of the workforce, would also reduce the economy's productive capacity. This would result in a leftward shift of the LRAS curve, not a rightward shift.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**A. Increase in capital.**"
