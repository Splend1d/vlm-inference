The reserve ratio is the fraction of deposits that the bank must hold as reserves. From the balance sheet, we can see that the bank has reserves of $493 and deposits of $2900. Therefore, the reserve ratio is:\n\\[ \\text{Reserve Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Reserves}}{\\text{Deposits}} = \\frac{493}{2900} \\approx 0.17 \\]\n\nNow, we can calculate the money multiplier:\n\\[ \\text{Money Multiplier} = \\frac{1}{0.17} \\approx 5.88 \\]\n\nWhen someone deposits $700, the initial increase in the money supply is $700. However, this deposit will lead to further lending and redepositing, increasing the money supply by a multiple of the initial deposit. The total increase in the money supply is given by:\n\\[ \\text{Increase in Money Supply} = \\text{Initial Deposit} \\times \\text{Money Multiplier} = 700 \\times 5.88 \\approx 4116 \\]\n\nHowever, the question asks for the minimum amount by which the money supply will increase. The minimum increase is simply the initial deposit itself, which is $700.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{700} \\]"
