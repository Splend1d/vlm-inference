This is because more money in circulation can lead to increased demand for goods and services, pushing prices up.\n\n3. **Long-Run Adjustment**: In the long run, the economy adjusts to the new higher inflation rate. The Phillips curve shifts to the right (or upward), reflecting the new higher inflation rate at each level of unemployment. This is represented by Curve 1 in the graph.\n\n4. **New Equilibrium**: Given the new higher inflation rate, the economy will move to a point on the new Phillips curve (Curve 1) that corresponds to the same unemployment rate as before. Since the initial unemployment rate at point B is 6%, the new equilibrium will be at point D on Curve 1, where the unemployment rate is still 6% but the inflation rate is higher.\n\nTherefore, if the economy starts at B and the money supply growth rate increases, in the long run, the economy moves to D.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nB. moves to D."
