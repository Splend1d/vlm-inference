In this case, the worker has 24 hours in a day, which can be allocated between work and leisure.\n\n2. **Indifference Curves (IC)**: Indifference curves represent combinations of work and leisure that provide the same level of utility to the worker. Higher indifference curves indicate higher levels of utility.\n\n3. **Optimal Choice**: The optimal choice for the worker is where the highest possible indifference curve is tangent to the budget constraint. This point represents the combination of work and leisure that maximizes the worker's utility.\n\nFrom the graph:\n- The budget constraint is a straight line from the origin to the point where all 24 hours are spent on leisure.\n- The highest indifference curve (IC 2) is tangent to the budget constraint at point 'a'.\n\nAt point 'a':\n- The worker is choosing some amount of work and some amount of leisure.\n- The exact number of hours spent on leisure can be read from the x-axis at point 'a'.\n\nBy examining the graph, it appears that the worker chooses approximately 16 hours of leisure and 8 hours of work.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nC. Leisure time is 8 hours."
