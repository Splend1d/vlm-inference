Proponents argue that human cognition evolved from primary sensorimotor processing and this necessitates understanding cognitive mechanisms as an interaction between the mind and body. An example of embodied cognition can be seen in mental imagery. There is strong evidence in favor of the visual imagery of an action conflicting with the performance of that action, such as visualizing an 'X' while writing an 'O'. Memory is also believed to be embodied. Proponents of theories of embodied cognition view memory as a representation of the event or object, linked to the sensorimotor information, which defines the possibilities of that event or object. To test whether sensorimotor experience aids decision making, researchers asked professional hockey players and people unfamiliar with hockey to read aloud either sentences that described hockey-specific situations or situations encountered in a normal day. An example of a hockey specific situation was reading the sentence \"the player knocked over the net\" and a picture of a hockey net tipped over (match) or right side up (mismatch) was displayed. An example of a situation encountered in a normal day was \"an umbrella was put into the closet\", with a closed (match) or open (mismatch) umbrella pictured. The subject pressed a button to indicate the sentence had been read; a fixation point was shown for 500 msec before a picture was displayed. The time was recorded between the picture presentation and the response of match or mismatch. Figure 1 shows the data from this experiment. Figure 1: The mean accuracy for matched and mismatched sentence/picture combinations for expert hockey players and people unfamiliar with hockey. Results for both hockey and nonhockey related scenarios are displayed. <image 1> How does the model for embodied cognition differ from the information-processing model?\n\nA. The information-processing model is often characterized by a metaphor of mind like a computer; however, the embodied cognition model views cognition as a product of represented actions, environment, and past experience.\nB. Both models are characterized by a metaphor of mind like a computer, rule based and logic driven; however, the embodied cognition model views cognition as passive and problem solving as being based on the computation of inputs and outputs.\nC. They are essentially the same.\nD. The embodied cognition model is characterized by a metaphor of mind like a computer; however, the information-processing model views cognition as a product of represented actions, environment, and past experience.\n"

The information-processing model is often characterized by a metaphor of mind like a computer; however, the embodied cognition model views cognition as a product of represented actions, environment, and past experience.**\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Information-Processing Model**: This model draws a parallel between the human mind and a computer. It suggests that the brain processes information through a series of steps involving input, storage, transformation, and output. It emphasizes the role of internal mental representations and computations.\n\n- **Embodied Cognition Model**: In contrast, the embodied cognition model posits that cognition is deeply influenced by the physical body and its interactions with the environment. It argues that our thoughts, perceptions, and decisions are shaped by our bodily experiences and the context in which they occur. This model highlights the importance of sensorimotor processes and the integration of past experiences with current environmental cues.\n\nThe graph provided illustrates how sensorimotor experience (being familiar with hockey vs. not) affects decision-making accuracy in matching tasks. Experts in hockey perform better when the scenario matches their sensorimotor experience, supporting the idea that embodied cognition plays a role in processing and decision-making. This aligns with the principles of embodied cognition where the body's interaction with the environment influences cognitive processes. \n\nOptions B, C, and D are incorrect because they either misrepresent the characteristics of one or both models or suggest that the two models are fundamentally similar, which they are not."
