This relationship is typically depicted as an inverted U-shaped curve.\n\nLet's analyze each graph:\n\nA. The first graph shows an inverted U-shaped curve, which matches the Yerkes-Dodson Law.\nB. The second graph shows a curve that levels off, indicating a plateau in performance after a certain level of arousal.\nC. The third graph shows a linear increase in performance with arousal, which does not match the Yerkes-Dodson Law.\nD. The fourth graph shows a U-shaped curve, which indicates a minimum performance at low arousal and increasing performance as arousal increases, which is not consistent with the Yerkes-Dodson Law.\nE. The fifth graph shows a linear decrease in performance with increasing arousal, which is also not consistent with the Yerkes-Dodson Law.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n\\boxed{A}"
