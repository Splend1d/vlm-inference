This suggests that children are learning aggressive behaviors by observing and imitating the violent actions they see in the media.\n\nGiven this context, the most effective explanation for the data is:\n\nE. Observational learning\n\nObservational learning, also known as social learning theory, posits that people can learn new behaviors by watching others perform those behaviors. In this case, children may be learning and adopting aggressive behaviors by observing violent content in the media."
