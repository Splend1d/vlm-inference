At the end of the dual-task presentation, the students were tested both for their memory of the passage and their memory of the photographs. To establish a baseline for this dual-task condition, the same students also were tested for their memory when each of the component tasks was presented alone.

This is crucial because if all participants perform the baseline condition first and then the dual-task condition, any differences observed could be due to factors like fatigue or practice effects rather than the actual impact of divided attention. By counterbalancing, we ensure that these potential confounding variables are minimized.\n\n**Option B: A consistent order in which participants are tested in the baseline and dual-task conditions**\n\nThis option suggests that all participants should be tested in the same order (e.g., baseline first, then dual-task). However, this can introduce order effects, as mentioned above. Therefore, this is not the best approach to ensure the validity of the results.\n\n**Option C: An equal number of men and women as participants**\n\nWhile having an equal number of men and women might help in ensuring that gender does not confound the results, it is not the most critical factor in a study of divided attention. The primary concern is the effect of the task conditions on performance, not the demographic characteristics of the participants.\n\n**Option D: Verification that participants believe themselves capable of dividing attention**\n\nParticipants' beliefs about their own capabilities can influence their performance, but this is more related to psychological factors and self-efficacy rather than the fundamental design of the experiment. Ensuring that participants believe they can divide attention is less critical compared to controlling for order effects.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most important aspect of the experimental design is to control for order effects by counterbalancing the order in which participants are tested in the baseline and dual-task conditions.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n\\boxed{A}"
