The frontal lobe is responsible for functions such as reasoning, motor skills, higher level cognition, and expressive language.\n2. **Lobe 2**: This is located above the temporal lobe and behind the frontal lobe. The parietal lobe is involved in processing sensory information such as pressure, touch, and pain.\n3. **Lobe 3**: This is located at the back of the brain. The occipital lobe is primarily responsible for visual processing.\n4. **Lobe 4**: This is located below the parietal lobe and behind the frontal lobe. The temporal lobe is involved in hearing, memory, and speech.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct order of the lobes labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4 is:\n\nC. Frontal lobe, parietal lobe, occipital lobe, temporal lobe\n\nSo, the correct answer is C."
