In a variable ratio schedule, the number of responses required for a reinforcer varies around an average number. This typically results in a high and steady rate of responding because the subject does not know exactly how many responses are needed for the next reinforcer.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n- **A**: This curve shows a very steep and consistent increase in the cumulative number of responses over time, suggesting a fixed ratio or continuous reinforcement schedule.\n- **B**: This curve also shows a relatively consistent increase but with some variability, which could suggest a fixed interval or fixed ratio schedule.\n- **C**: This curve shows a more irregular pattern with varying intervals between responses, which is characteristic of a variable ratio schedule.\n- **D**: This curve shows a sudden increase followed by a plateau, which is more indicative of a fixed interval schedule where responses occur just before the expected time of reinforcement.\n- **E**: This curve shows no responses at all, indicating no reinforcement.\n\nGiven the characteristics of a variable ratio schedule, the curve that best fits this description is **C**.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nC.
