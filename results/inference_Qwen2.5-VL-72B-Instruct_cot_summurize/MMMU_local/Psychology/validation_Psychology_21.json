Further, clinical psychologists must consider factors that influence the incidence rate and characteristics of clinical populations that they treat. The following graphs depict data from a study by L. R. Snowden and F. K. Cheung, who examined demographic differences in the incidence rate of schizophrenia. The first figure shows the percentage rates for schizophrenia diagnosis among individuals admitted for psychiatric care who classified themselves as\"African American,\" White,\" \"Hispanic American,\" or \"Asian American and other.\" <image 1> The following graph shows the percentage rates for mood disorder diagnosis among individuals admitted for psychiatric care, by the same ethnicity classifications. <image 2> Based on psychological research investigating the causes of schizophrenia, which of the following is NOT true?\n\nA. Schizophrenia has a genetic component that can be inherited from biological parents, but genetic factors alone cannot account for the development of the disorder.\nB. The production and activity of specific chemical substances in the brain have been found to be associated with schizophrenia.\nC. Environmental factors contribute to the development of schizophrenia.\nD. A person has a 100% chance of developing schizophrenia if both of his or her parents have schizophrenia.\n"

Research indicates that genetics play a significant role in the risk of developing schizophrenia, but it is not the sole factor. Other environmental and developmental factors also contribute.\n\nB. **The production and activity of specific chemical substances in the brain have been found to be associated with schizophrenia.**\n   - This statement is true. Neurotransmitters such as dopamine and glutamate have been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.\n\nC. **Environmental factors contribute to the development of schizophrenia.**\n   - This statement is true. Environmental factors like prenatal stress, early life adversity, substance abuse, and social isolation can increase the risk of developing schizophrenia.\n\nD. **A person has a 100% chance of developing schizophrenia if both of his or her parents have schizophrenia.**\n   - This statement is false. While having a family history of schizophrenia increases the risk significantly, it does not guarantee a 100% chance of developing the disorder. The actual risk is much lower, typically around 40-60% if both parents have schizophrenia.\n\nTherefore, the statement that is NOT true is:\n\n**D. A person has a 100% chance of developing schizophrenia if both of his or her parents have schizophrenia.**"
