Social loafing is a phenomenon where individuals in a group tend to exert less effort when working collectively compared to when they work alone. This is evident from the graph, which shows that as the group size increases, the amount of effort decreases. \n\nHere's a brief explanation of why the other options are not correct:\n\n- **Social facilitation**: This refers to the tendency for people to perform better on simple tasks and worse on complex tasks when others are present. The graph does not show this pattern.\n- **Group polarization**: This is the strengthening of a group's initial inclination through discussion within the group. The graph does not depict any discussion or decision-making process.\n- **Groupthink**: This occurs when a group prioritizes harmony and conformity over critical evaluation of alternatives. The graph does not show any decision-making or consensus-building process.\n- **Minority influence**: This is the ability of a minority to influence the majority. The graph does not show any influence dynamics between different groups.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Social loafing"
