These levels can be broken down into four major stages: N1, N2, N3, and REM. REM refers to rapid eye movement, a major characteristic of this stage. REM is the stage where your most vivid dreams occur and is required to feel fully rested. It is also characterized by atonia caused by inhibition of the motor neurons. N1, N2, and N3 are all non-rapid-eye-movement sleep stages, also called synchronized sleep, due to the nature of electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings during these periods. N1 is the onset of sleep, and when you experience \"hypnic jerks\" - often associated with the feeling of falling. N2, light sleep, is where you spend about 50% of your night. N3, known as deep sleep, is characterized by very slow brain waves. Sleepwalking, also known as somnambulism, occurs chiefly during this sleep stage. As you fall asleep, you pass through N1, N2, N3, and back to N2 before achieving REM sleep. This typically occurs about 90 minutes after falling asleep, and the first REM will last about 20 minutes. As the night progresses, one spends more time in REM sleep, and less in N3. The average night of sleep includes five of these cycles. <image 1> How many complete sleep cycles can be seen in Figure 1?\n\nA. 7\nB. 5\nC. 4\nD. 6\n"

A complete sleep cycle typically includes all stages of sleep: N1, N2, N3, and REM. \n\nIn the figure:\n- Each vertical bar represents a different sleep stage.\n- The sequence of stages in a complete cycle is usually N1 \u2192 N2 \u2192 N3 \u2192 N2 \u2192 REM.\n\nBy examining the pattern:\n1. The first cycle starts at the beginning and ends around the 1.5-hour mark.\n2. The second cycle starts around the 1.5-hour mark and ends around the 3-hour mark.\n3. The third cycle starts around the 3-hour mark and ends around the 4.5-hour mark.\n4. The fourth cycle starts around the 4.5-hour mark and ends around the 6-hour mark.\n5. The fifth cycle starts around the 6-hour mark and ends around the 7.5-hour mark.\n\nEach of these cycles includes all the necessary stages of sleep. Therefore, there are 5 complete sleep cycles visible in the figure.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nB. 5"
