Research on spectral sensitivity of the rod receptors (scattered throughout the retina) and cone visual receptors (mainly concentrated in the fovea area of the retina) highlights the relationship between perception and physiology. Signal detection methods have been used to measure the differences in how perception adjusts to low-light environments. Participant responses can be plotted based on sensitivity versus length of time in the dark. The dark adaptation curve can be plotted showing how rods and cones differ in their sensitivity to light over time. The following graph shows a plot of three calculated dark adaptation curves. <image 1> Which of the following statements is true?\n\nA. Rods are responsible for color vision, which explains color sensitivity under low-light conditions.\nB. Cones are responsible for color vision, which explains greater color sensitivity under low-light conditions.\nC. Rods do not respond preferentially to wavelengths in the light spectrum, which explains why colors are not detectable in low-light conditions.\nD. Both rods and cones respond to specific colors in the light spectrum; loss of color vision in dark conditions is the result of fewer photons of light.\n"

                    "text": "To determine the correct statement, let's analyze the information provided and the graph:\n\n1. **Understanding Rods and Cones:**\n   - **Rods:** These are highly sensitive to light but do not distinguish colors. They are responsible for vision in low-light conditions.\n   - **Cones:** These are less sensitive to light but are responsible for color vision and function best in well-lit conditions.\n\n2. **Graph Analysis:**\n   - The graph shows two dashed lines representing the sensitivity of rods and cones separately, and a solid line representing the combined sensitivity of both.\n   - The rod sensitivity decreases sharply as light levels decrease, indicating that rods are more active in low-light conditions.\n   - The cone sensitivity remains relatively constant at higher light levels but drops off significantly in low-light conditions.\n\n3. **Evaluating the Statements:**\n   - **A. Rods are responsible for color vision, which explains color sensitivity under low-light conditions.**\n     - This is incorrect because rods do not contribute to color vision.\n   - **B. Cones are responsible for color vision, which explains greater color sensitivity under low-light conditions.**\n     - This is incorrect because cones do not function well in low-light conditions, as shown by the graph where cone sensitivity drops off.\n   - **C. Rods do not respond preferentially to wavelengths in the light spectrum, which explains why colors are not detectable in low-light conditions.**\n     - This is correct. Rods do not distinguish colors, so in low-light conditions when rods are primarily active, colors are not detectable.\n   - **D. Both rods and cones respond to specific colors in the light spectrum; loss of color vision in dark conditions is the result of fewer photons of light.**\n     - This is partially correct but misleading. While it is true that fewer photons affect vision, it is specifically the lack of cone activity in low-light conditions that results in the loss of color vision.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct statement is:\n\n**C. Rods do not respond preferentially to wavelengths in the light spectrum, which explains why colors are not detectable in low-light conditions.**"
