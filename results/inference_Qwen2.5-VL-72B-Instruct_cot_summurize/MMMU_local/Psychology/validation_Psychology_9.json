This suggests that the researchers are interested in how participants react to various forms of authority.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Perception of authority**: This could be an independent variable if the researchers are manipulating how authority is perceived (e.g., by presenting different types of authority figures).\n\nB. **Conformity**: This is more likely to be a dependent variable, as it would be the outcome measured in response to the manipulation of authority.\n\nC. **Perception of behavior**: This is less likely to be the independent variable since the focus is on authority rather than behavior perception.\n\nD. **Response to authority**: This is more likely to be a dependent variable, as it describes the outcome of the participants' reactions to the authority presented.\n\nE. **Age**: While age could be a variable considered in the study, it is not mentioned as something being manipulated in the advertisement.\n\nGiven the context, the most likely independent variable is the **perception of authority**, as the researchers are likely manipulating different types of authority to observe participants' responses.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nA. Perception of authority"
