                    "text": "One of the central questions in language is of linguistic determinism. Language is an important component of one's ability to comprehend numbers and quantities. Counting takes many forms depending on culture. Researchers have not yet found a language that does not represent numbers. Some cultures use body parts to count or forms of recursion using a small numerical base. Gumulgal South Sea Islanders count utilizing a recursive binary system. The Piraha are a monolingual population (< 200 population) that have rejected assimilation with the Brazilian culture. A predominantly hunter-gatherer population, the Piraha live in villages of between 10 and 20 people on the banks of the Maici River in Brazil's Lowland Amazonia region. The Piraha counting system consists of what is termed the \"one-two-many\" system. Quantities beyond two are described as many, in this system of counting. A researcher visited the Piraha tribe to test the impact of counting systems on the ability to estimate quantity. Members of the Piraha tribe were given a visual counting task to test the impact of numerical systems on visual estimation. Each tribe member was allowed to inspect a group of nuts for a few seconds. The nuts were placed in an opaque can, so the quantity could not be viewed. For each trial, a nut was removed from the can, and the tribe member was asked to tell the researcher if the can still contained nuts. Tribe members who were able to estimate the quantity of nuts in the can would be able to tell when there were none left. Figure 1 shows the proportion of correct responses averaged for each target number of nuts over all trials. Figure 1: Results for the Piraha tribe members' trials averaged for each target number (n = 63). For each trial, each tribe member estimated the number of nuts left in the can (target). The proportion of correct responses is shown (the first and last nut were excluded). <image 1> Which theory would support the viewpoint: the Piraha have not needed a counting system that uses numbers beyond two and when a better numbering system is necessary, their language will create it?\n\nA.

                    "text": "The viewpoint that the Piraha have not needed a counting system that uses numbers beyond two and that they will develop a more complex numbering system when necessary aligns most closely with **Weak Linguistic Determinism**.\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Weak Linguistic Determinism**: This theory suggests that language influences thought but does not strictly determine it. It posits that while language can shape how we think about certain concepts, it doesn't completely dictate our cognitive abilities. In the context of the Piraha, weak linguistic determinism would suggest that their current lack of a need for numbers beyond two has influenced their language, but if such a need arises in the future, their language could evolve to accommodate more complex numerical concepts.\n\n- **Piaget**: Piaget's theory focuses on stages of cognitive development and how children acquire knowledge through interaction with their environment. It does not specifically address the relationship between language and numerical cognition in adults or cultural contexts.\n\n- **Vygotsky**: Vygotsky's theory emphasizes the role of social and cultural factors in cognitive development. While it acknowledges the importance of language and culture, it does not specifically focus on the idea that language evolves based on necessity.\n\n- **Whorfian Hypothesis (Strong Linguistic Determinism)**: This theory suggests that language strictly determines thought. According to strong linguistic determinism, if the Piraha do not have words for numbers beyond two, they cannot think about or understand quantities beyond two. This is a stronger claim than what is suggested by the statement in question.\n\nGiven these explanations, **Option D: Weak Linguistic Determinism** is the best choice to support the viewpoint presented."
