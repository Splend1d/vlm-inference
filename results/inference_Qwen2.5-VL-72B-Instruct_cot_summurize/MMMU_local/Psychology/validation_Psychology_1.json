Shows a U-shape, which does not match the Yerkes-Dodson Law.\nC. Shows a flat line, indicating no relationship between performance and arousal.\nD. Shows a linear increase, which does not match the Yerkes-Dodson Law.\nE. Shows a linear decrease, which does not match the Yerkes-Dodson Law.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. <image 1>"
