This theory posits that an emotional experience requires both a physiological response and a cognitive interpretation of that response. According to this model, an emotional stimulus triggers both a physiological response and a conscious cognitive interpretation, which together lead to a behavioral response and the labeling of the emotion.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the steps in the figure:\n\n1. **Emotional-Inducing Stimulus**: An event or situation that triggers an emotional response.\n2. **Physiological Response**: The body's physical reaction to the stimulus (e.g., increased heart rate, sweating).\n3. **Conscious Cognitive Interpretation**: The individual's thoughts and understanding of the situation and their physiological state.\n4. **Behavioral Response**: The actions taken in response to the emotion.\n5. **Labeling of Emotion**: The final step where the individual identifies and labels the emotion based on the combination of physiological and cognitive factors.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Schachter-Singer Theory"
