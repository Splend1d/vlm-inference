This relationship is typically represented by an inverted U-shaped curve.\n\nLet's analyze each graph:\n\nA. The first graph shows a U-shaped curve, indicating that performance decreases as arousal increases, then increases again. This does not match the Yerkes-Dodson Law.\n\nB. The second graph shows a straight line with a negative slope, indicating that performance decreases as arousal increases. This does not match the Yerkes-Dodson Law.\n\nC. The third graph shows a V-shaped curve, indicating that performance decreases as arousal increases, then increases again. This does not match the Yerkes-Dodson Law.\n\nD. The fourth graph shows a straight line with a positive slope, indicating that performance increases as arousal increases. This does not match the Yerkes-Dodson Law.\n\nE. The fifth graph shows an inverted U-shaped curve, indicating that performance increases with arousal up to a point, after which it decreases. This matches the Yerkes-Dodson Law.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n\\boxed{E}"
