Some patients cope with stress by adopting unhealthy habits (like drinking, smoking, or withdrawing from social relationships), which can increase symptom severity and result in poor quality of life both during and after cancer treatment. Conversely, individuals who manage stress with healthy techniques can experience symptom relief and improved quality of life. A group of oncologists hope to promote healthy stress reduction and decide to focus their efforts on deep breathing. They postulate that a deep breathing exercise will induce the relaxation response, a physical state of deep rest that is the physiological opposite of a stress response (or fight or flight). They believe that when patients learn to breathe more slowly and deeply, their muscles will relax, blood pressure will decrease, and heart rates will slow down (all characteristics of the relaxation response). When testing the exercise with two patients they notice significant decreases in blood pressure, muscle tension, and heart rate. They conclude that the exercise could decrease select physical symptoms of stress. The oncologists decide to expand their testing, and develop several deep-breathing exercises to be delivered in a group format. They believe that the combined exercises will help patients cope during times of stress. The program consists of 30-minute guided group breathing classes that occur biweekly for 8 weeks. Patients are also asked to complete home deep breathing practices. To test their theory, they recruit 10 adult cancer patients to participate in their program. The patient group is homogenous in type and stage of cancer. All patients have recently received their cancer diagnosis. The patients are all between 45 and 55 years old (mean age 48.6) and there are equal numbers of men and women in the group. Each patient completes a stress symptom checklist both before and after the intervention. The stress symptoms checklist can be found in Table 1. The symptom checklist is divided into four categories, with six possible symptoms in each category. Patients are instructed to circle any and all symptoms they are currently experiencing. The results from the study can be found in Figure 1 <image 1>. Which coping strategy best describes the deep breathing program?\n\nA. Appraisal focused coping because it challenges patient's assumptions about cancer and relaxation.\nB. Emotion focused coping because it teaches patients to manage emotions that accompany perception of stress.\nC. Problem focused coping because the program is aimed at learning more about stress and taking control.\nD. Avoidance focused coping because patients distance themselves from their physiological reaction to stressful experiences.\n"

Emotion-focused coping**.\n\nHere\u2019s why:\n\n- **Emotion-focused coping** involves strategies that aim to regulate emotional responses to stress. Deep breathing exercises are designed to induce a relaxation response, which helps manage the emotional and physical reactions associated with stress. By teaching patients to breathe more slowly and deeply, the program aims to reduce feelings of anxiety, frustration, and other negative emotions that can arise from stress.\n\nLet's examine why the other options are not suitable:\n\n- **A. Appraisal-focused coping**: This type of coping involves changing how one thinks about the stressor. While deep breathing may indirectly influence how patients perceive stress, the primary goal is not to challenge assumptions but rather to manage the immediate emotional and physical reactions.\n\n- **C. Problem-focused coping**: This involves actively addressing the source of stress. The deep breathing program does not directly address the underlying cause of stress (the cancer diagnosis); instead, it focuses on managing the symptoms and emotional responses to stress.\n\n- **D. Avoidance-focused coping**: This involves avoiding or distancing oneself from the stressor. The deep breathing program does not encourage avoidance; rather, it provides a method to cope with the stress while still acknowledging its presence.\n\nTherefore, the deep breathing program is an example of emotion-focused coping, as it teaches patients to manage their emotional responses to stress through relaxation techniques."
