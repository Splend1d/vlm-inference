All groups were given the same set of questions in an exam, but the exam began with a brief introductory statement that differed for each group, establishing differing expectations for student performance, as follows: Group A: The introduction stated that most students are expected to pass the exam. Group B: The introduction stated that most students are expected to fail the exam. Group C: The introduction included statistics that showed female students performing worse than male students on similar exams. Group D: The introduction contained no information on expected performance. The results of the experiment are given in the bar graph below: <image 1> What phenomenon best explains the performance differences between Groups A and B?\n\nA. Social facilitation\nB.

The Pygmalion effect\n\nThe Pygmalion effect, also known as the Rosenthal effect, refers to the phenomenon where higher expectations lead to an increase in performance. In this experiment, Group A was told that most students are expected to pass the exam, which likely led to higher confidence and better performance. Conversely, Group B was told that most students are expected to fail, which may have lowered their confidence and resulted in poorer performance. This aligns with the Pygmalion effect, where the expectations set by the introductory statements influenced the students' actual performance.\n\nLet's briefly review the other options:\n\nA. Social facilitation - This refers to the tendency for people to perform better on simple tasks when they are in the presence of others. It does not explain the performance differences based on expectations.\n\nB. Group polarization - This is the tendency for a group to make decisions that are more extreme than the initial inclination of its members. It does not apply to individual performance based on expectations.\n\nC. Self-serving bias - This is the tendency to attribute success to internal factors and failure to external factors. It does not explain the influence of expectations on performance.\n\nD. Unstable attribution - This refers to attributing outcomes to unstable factors that can change over time. It does not directly relate to the impact of expectations on performance.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is \\boxed{E}."
