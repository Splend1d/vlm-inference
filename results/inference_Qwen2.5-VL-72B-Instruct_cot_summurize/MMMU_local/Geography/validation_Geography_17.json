The center distance of the piles is typically governed by the diameter \\( D \\) of the piles.\n\nThe general rule for the minimum center distance \\( S \\) between precast concrete piles is given by:\n\n\\[ S \\geq 3D \\]\n\nThis means that the center distance should be at least three times the diameter of the piles. This ensures that there is sufficient space between the piles to avoid interference during driving and to allow for proper soil compaction around each pile.\n\nGiven the options:\nA. 4D\nB. 3.5D\nC. 3.0D\nD. 2.5D\n\nThe correct choice based on the standard practice is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{C}\n\\]"
