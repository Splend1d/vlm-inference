In this case, the cone settlement of a cohesive soil undisturbed sample was measured using a 76g liquid limit instrument, and the depth of penetration was recorded as 6mm.\n\nTo determine the natural state of the cohesive soil based on the penetration depth, we can refer to the following general classification:\n\n- **Hard Plastic**: Penetration depth < 2 mm\n- **Plastic**: Penetration depth between 2 mm and 5 mm\n- **Soft Plastic**: Penetration depth between 5 mm and 10 mm\n- **Flow Molding**: Penetration depth > 10 mm\n\nGiven that the penetration depth is 6mm, it falls within the range for \"Soft Plastic.\"\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. Soft plastic**"
