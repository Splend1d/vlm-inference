                    "text": "To determine which rock mass structure types do not belong to the \"Code for Geological Investigation of Water Resources and Hydropower Engineering\" (GB 50287-99), we need to analyze each option in the context of the standard classification provided by this code.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Option A: Overall, block, and sub-block structures**\n   - These terms generally refer to the overall integrity and blockiness of the rock mass. They are commonly used in rock mass classification systems like the RMR (Rock Mass Rating) system.\n   - The \"Code for Geological Investigation of Water Resources and Hydropower Engineering\" (GB 50287-99) does include these types of classifications as they are fundamental in assessing the stability and behavior of rock masses in engineering projects.\n\n2. **Option B: Giant thick layered, thick layered, medium thick layered, interbedded, and thin layered structures**\n   - These terms describe the layering characteristics of the rock mass, which is an important factor in geological investigations, especially for water resources and hydropower engineering.\n   - The code likely includes these types of classifications as they help in understanding the stratification and potential sliding or failure planes in the rock mass.\n\n3. **Option C: Weathering unloading structure and weathering fragment structure**\n   - These terms specifically relate to the effects of weathering on the rock mass. Weathering can significantly alter the properties and behavior of the rock.\n   - The code would typically include such classifications because weathering effects are crucial in assessing the long-term stability and performance of rock masses in engineering projects.\n\n4. **Option D: Inlaid fragmented structure and fragmented structure**\n   - These terms describe the fragmentation of the rock mass, where the rock is broken into smaller pieces either due to natural processes or human activities.\n   - While fragmentation is an important aspect of rock mass characterization, the specific terms \"inlaid fragmented structure\" and \"fragmented structure\" might not be explicitly defined in the same way in the \"Code for Geological Investigation of Water Resources and Hydropower Engineering\" (GB 50287-99). The code may use different terminology or categorization for similar concepts.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis, the rock mass structure types that do not belong to the \"Code for Geological Investigation of Water Resources and Hydropower Engineering\" (GB 50287-99) are most likely those in Option D.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\\boxed{D}"
