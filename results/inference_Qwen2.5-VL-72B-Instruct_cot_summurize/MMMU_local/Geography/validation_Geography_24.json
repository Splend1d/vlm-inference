                    "text": "To determine the appropriate testing method for evaluating the uniformity and compactness of crushed stone fill, we need to consider the nature of the material and the purpose of the test. Crushed stone fill is typically used in construction as a base layer or sub-base for roads, foundations, and other structures. The goal is to ensure that the fill is well-compacted and uniform to provide a stable foundation.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Static penetration test**: This test involves pushing a penetrometer into the soil at a constant rate without any hammer blows. It is generally used for softer soils and not suitable for evaluating the compaction of crushed stone fill.\n\nB. **Light power penetration**: This test uses a light hammer to drive a penetrometer into the soil. It is also more suited for softer soils and not ideal for evaluating the compaction of crushed stone fill.\n\nC. **Heavy power penetration**: This test uses a heavy hammer to drive a penetrometer into the soil. It can be used for harder materials but is still not specifically designed for evaluating the compaction of crushed stone fill.\n\nD. **Standard penetration test (SPT)**: This test involves driving a standard split-barrel sampler into the ground using a drop hammer. It is widely used in geotechnical engineering to evaluate the compaction and density of granular materials like crushed stone fill. The SPT provides a measure of the resistance of the soil to penetration, which can be used to assess the uniformity and compactness of the fill.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the most appropriate testing method for evaluating the uniformity and compactness of crushed stone fill is the Standard Penetration Test (SPT).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is \\boxed{D}."
