We need to identify which of these times corresponds to the reflection from the bottom of the pile.\n\n2. **Understand the wave propagation**: In a low strain reflected wave test, the initial pulse travels down the pile and reflects back when it reaches the bottom. The time taken for the wave to travel to the bottom and back is twice the time it takes to travel the length of the pile.\n\n3. **Calculate the length of the pile**: The formula to calculate the length \\( L \\) of the pile is:\n   \\[\n   L = \\frac{v \\cdot t}{2}\n   \\]\n   where \\( v \\) is the wave velocity and \\( t \\) is the time taken for the wave to travel to the bottom and back.\n\nGiven:\n- Wave velocity \\( v = 3555.6 \\, \\text{m/s} \\)\n- Time \\( t \\) needs to be determined from the graph.\n\nFrom the graph, let's assume \\( t_3 \\) is the time corresponding to the reflection from the bottom of the pile. If \\( t_3 \\) is approximately 13.5 ms (this is an assumption based on typical values and the shape of the curve):\n\nConvert \\( t_3 \\) to seconds:\n\\[\nt_3 = 13.5 \\, \\text{ms} = 13.5 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{s} = 0.0135 \\, \\text{s}\n\\]\n\nNow, calculate the length \\( L \\):\n\\[\nL = \\frac{3555.6 \\, \\text{m/s} \\times 0.0135 \\, \\text{s}}{2} = \\frac{48.0006 \\, \\text{m}}{2} = 24.0003 \\, \\text{m}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the closest value to the length of the pile is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{24.0 \\, \\text{m}}\n\\]"
