Unit moving load with unchanged direction\nB. Moving load\nC. Dynamic load\nD. Movable load\n\nThe influence line is a graphical representation that shows the variation of a particular response function (such as shear force, bending moment, etc.) at a specific point in a structure due to a unit moving load. The key points to consider are:\n\n1. **Unit Moving Load**: The load is typically considered as a unit load (i.e., a load of magnitude 1) to simplify the calculations and make the influence line directly applicable to any other load by scaling.\n2. **Unchanged Direction**: The direction of the load remains constant as it moves along the structure. This ensures that the influence line accurately represents the effect of the load at different positions.\n\nGiven these considerations, the correct choice is:\n\nA. Unit moving load with unchanged direction\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\n\\boxed{A}"
