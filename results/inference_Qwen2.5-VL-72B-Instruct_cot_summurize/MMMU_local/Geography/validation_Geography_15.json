Siltstone is indeed formed from silt-sized particles that are cemented together.\n\nB. **Shale is Clay, breaking easily into flat flakes and plates**: This statement is also correct. Shale is a fine-grained sedimentary rock composed mainly of clay minerals and is known for its ability to break into thin, flat layers or plates.\n\nC. **Chert is Silica, a microcrystalline form of quartz**: This statement is not entirely accurate. While chert is indeed a form of silica, it is more specifically a microcrystalline variety of quartz. However, the term \"microcrystalline\" is more precise than just saying \"silica.\" Silica is a chemical compound (SiO2), whereas chert is a specific type of rock made up of microcrystalline quartz.\n\nD. **None**: This option would be correct only if all the other statements were incorrect, which is not the case here.\n\nGiven this analysis, the statement that is not entirely correct is:\n\nC. **Chert is Silica, a microcrystalline form of quartz**\n\nSo, the correct answer is C."
