The given problem involves a simply supported beam with a uniformly distributed load (UDL) and two concentrated loads at points H and G.\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the given information:**\n   - The beam is simply supported at points A and B.\n   - There is a uniformly distributed load (UDL) of \\( q = 3 \\) kN/m over the entire length of the beam.\n   - There are two concentrated loads \\( T_H = 6 \\) kN at point H and \\( T_G = 9 \\) kN at point G.\n   - The length of the beam AB is 6 meters.\n   - The distance from A to H is 2 meters, from H to G is 2 meters, and from G to B is 2 meters.\n\n2. **Calculate the reactions at supports A and B:**\n   - The total load due to the UDL is \\( q \\times L = 3 \\times 6 = 18 \\) kN.\n   - The total load due to the concentrated loads is \\( T_H + T_G = 6 + 9 = 15 \\) kN.\n   - The total downward force is \\( 18 + 15 = 33 \\) kN.\n   - Since the beam is simply supported, the reactions at A and B will each be half of the total load:\n     \\[\n     R_A = R_B = \\frac{33}{2} = 16.5 \\text{ kN}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Determine the shear force and bending moment at point D:**\n   - Point D is located at the left end of the beam, so the only force acting on the left side of point D is the reaction at A.\n   - The shear force at point D is \\( R_A = 16.5 \\) kN.\n   - The bending moment at point D is the moment of the reaction at A about point D:\n     \\[\n     M_{DA} = R_A \\times 0 = 0 \\text{ kN?m}\n     \\]\n   - However, we need to consider the moment due to the UDL and the concentrated loads as well. The moment at point D due to the UDL and the concentrated loads can be calculated by considering the area under the shear force diagram up to point D.\n\n4. **Calculate the moment at point D due to the UDL and the concentrated loads:**\n   - The moment at point D due to the UDL from A to D is:\n     \\[\n     M_{UDL} = \\frac{q \\times x^2}{2} = \\frac{3 \\times 2^2}{2} = 6 \\text{ kN?m}\n     \\]\n   - The moment at point D due to the concentrated load at H is:\n     \\[\n     M_{H} = T_H \\times 2 = 6 \\times 2 = 12 \\text{ kN?m}\n     \\]\n   - The total moment at point D is:\n     \\[\n     M_{DA} = 6 + 12 = 18 \\text{ kN?m}\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the bending moment \\( M_{DA} \\) is \\(\\boxed{18}\\)."
