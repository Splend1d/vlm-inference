Here are some key observations:\n\n1. **Population Distribution**: The graph shows a relatively balanced distribution between males and females across different age groups.\n2. **Age Structure**: There is a significant proportion of the population in the younger age groups (0-20 years), which suggests a higher birth rate and a younger population.\n3. **Elderly Population**: The proportion of the elderly population (60+ years) is relatively small, indicating a lower life expectancy or a younger population structure.\n\nGiven these observations, let's consider the options:\n\n- **Kenya**: Known for a young population with a high birth rate and a lower life expectancy compared to developed countries.\n- **Kiribati**: A small island nation with a young population but not as large as Kenya.\n- **Kuwait**: Has a more balanced age structure with a significant portion of the population being adults due to immigration.\n- **Kyrgyzstan**: Also has a young population but may not have as high a birth rate as Kenya.\n\nBased on the graph, the country with a young population and a high birth rate is most likely **Kenya**.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nA. Kenya"
