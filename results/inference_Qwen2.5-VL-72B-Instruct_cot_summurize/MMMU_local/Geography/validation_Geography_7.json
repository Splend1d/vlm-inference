However, the map does not seem to emphasize these countries disproportionately.\n\n2. **Military Spending (Option B)**: Countries with high military spending, such as the United States, Russia, and Saudi Arabia, would be significantly enlarged. The map does not appear to reflect this pattern.\n\n3. **Average Education Level (Option C)**: This is less likely because educational levels are usually represented in thematic maps using colors or symbols rather than resizing countries.\n\n4. **Wealth 2021 Years Ago (Option D)**: This option seems nonsensical because it refers to a time period that predates human civilization and recorded history. Therefore, it cannot be a valid representation on a modern world map.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most plausible option is:\n\n**B. amount of money which is spent on military.**\n\nThe map appears to show a distortion where countries with higher military expenditures are larger, such as the United States, Russia, and parts of the Middle East."
