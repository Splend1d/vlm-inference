                    "text": "To determine the correct method for constructing the waterproofing layer of the basement exterior wall with coiled materials, let's analyze each option step by step:\n\n**Option A: The roll waterproof layer is laid on the upstream surface of the external wall**\n- This option suggests that the waterproofing layer should be placed on the side where water pressure is expected to come from (the upstream side). This is generally a good practice as it ensures that the waterproofing layer is directly exposed to the water and can effectively prevent water from entering the basement.\n\n**Option B: The roll waterproof layer is laid on the back surface of the external wall**\n- This option suggests placing the waterproofing layer on the opposite side of the wall from where the water pressure is expected. This would not be effective in preventing water from entering the basement because the waterproofing layer would not be in direct contact with the water source.\n\n**Option C: The outer wall roll adopts the empty laying method**\n- This option suggests using an empty laying method, which means the waterproofing layer is not adhered to the wall but rather loosely laid. This method is not typically recommended for basement waterproofing because it does not provide a secure bond between the waterproofing layer and the wall, potentially allowing water to seep through.\n\n**Option D: When laying double layer coils, the two layers of coils are perpendicular to each other**\n- This option suggests a specific method for laying double layers of waterproofing material. While this can be a valid technique in some cases, it does not address the primary concern of where the waterproofing layer should be placed relative to the water source.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most appropriate method for constructing the waterproofing layer of the basement exterior wall with coiled materials is to place the waterproofing layer on the upstream surface of the external wall. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n\\boxed{A}"
