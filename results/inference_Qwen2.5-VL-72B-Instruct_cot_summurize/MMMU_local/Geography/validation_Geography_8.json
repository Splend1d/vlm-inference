Point G is located on the 20th equipotential line out of 22 equipotential lines.\n   - The total head difference between the upstream and downstream faces of the dam is 16 meters (the storage height).\n   - The head drop per equipotential line is \\( \\frac{16 \\text{ meters}}{22} \\approx 0.727 \\text{ meters} \\).\n   - Since point G is on the 20th equipotential line, the head loss from the upstream face to point G is \\( 20 \\times 0.727 \\approx 14.54 \\text{ meters} \\).\n\n3. **Calculate the total head at point G:**\n   - The total head at point G is the elevation head plus the pressure head.\n   - The pressure head at point G is \\( 16 \\text{ meters} - 14.54 \\text{ meters} = 1.46 \\text{ meters} \\).\n   - Therefore, the total head at point G is \\( 11.5 \\text{ meters} + 1.46 \\text{ meters} = 12.96 \\text{ meters} \\).\n\n4. **Convert the total head to pore water pressure:**\n   - The pore water pressure \\( u \\) is given by \\( u = \\gamma_w \\times h \\), where \\( \\gamma_w \\) is the unit weight of water (approximately 9.81 kN/m\u00b3) and \\( h \\) is the total head.\n   - Thus, \\( u = 9.81 \\text{ kN/m}^3 \\times 12.96 \\text{ meters} \\approx 127.1 \\text{ kPa} \\).\n\nSince the closest option to 127.1 kPa is 115 kPa, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{C}"
