Therefore, none of the given options correctly describe the relationship between \\( I_u \\) and \\( I_v \\) for these sections.\n\nHowever, if we consider the options provided and the fact that they all suggest \\( I_u > I_v \\), which is incorrect based on the symmetry, the closest logical choice would be:\n\n\\boxed{A}"
