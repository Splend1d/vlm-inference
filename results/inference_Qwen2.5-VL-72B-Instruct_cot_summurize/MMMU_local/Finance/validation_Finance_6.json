All the investments require an initial $5,000 payment. <image 1> Calculate, to the nearest 1%, the rate of return on investment B available to Clare.\n\nA. 11%\nB. 8%\nC. 10%\nD. 9%\n"

The formula for the present value of a single future amount is:\n\n\\[ PV = \\frac{FV}{(1 + r)^n} \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( PV \\) is the present value ($5,000),\n- \\( FV \\) is the future value ($15,900),\n- \\( r \\) is the rate of return,\n- \\( n \\) is the number of years (15).\n\nWe need to solve for \\( r \\):\n\n\\[ 5000 = \\frac{15900}{(1 + r)^{15}} \\]\n\nRearranging the equation:\n\n\\[ (1 + r)^{15} = \\frac{15900}{5000} \\]\n\\[ (1 + r)^{15} = 3.18 \\]\n\nTaking the 15th root of both sides:\n\n\\[ 1 + r = 3.18^{1/15} \\]\n\\[ 1 + r \\approx 1.08 \\]\n\\[ r \\approx 0.08 \\]\n\nSo, the rate of return \\( r \\) is approximately 8%.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 8%"
