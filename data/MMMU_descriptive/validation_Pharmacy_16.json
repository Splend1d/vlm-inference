    "description": "The image shows a close-up view of a graduated cylinder with a liquid inside. The liquid level is between the 30 mL and 40 mL marks on the cylinder. The scale on the cylinder has markings at every milliliter, and there are finer divisions between these marks, likely representing tenths of a milliliter. The liquid level appears to be just below the 32 mL mark but slightly above the 31.8 mL mark. The background of the image includes a vertical ruler with measurements from 10 to 100, with the 30 mL mark on the cylinder aligning roughly with the 30 mark on the ruler."
