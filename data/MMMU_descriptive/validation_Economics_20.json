    "description": "The image is a graph depicting the supply and demand curves for bagels, along with the world price for bagels under free trade conditions. The x-axis represents the quantity of bagels, ranging from 0 to 12, while the y-axis represents the price of bagels in dollars, ranging from 0 to 12.\n\n- The demand curve is represented by a blue line that slopes downward from left to right, indicating that as the price decreases, the quantity demanded increases.\n- The supply curve is represented by a red line that slopes upward from left to right, indicating that as the price increases, the quantity supplied increases.\n- The point where the demand and supply curves intersect is at a price of $8 and a quantity of 4 bagels. This is the equilibrium point where the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied.\n- There is a dashed horizontal line labeled \"Price with Free Trade\" at $6, which indicates the world price for bagels under free trade conditions.\n\nBased on the description, the equilibrium price if this country does not trade is $8."
