    "description": "The image depicts an intricately designed object that appears to be a wooden or ceramic piece with a textured surface. The object has a curved shape and is adorned with numerous small, circular elements of various sizes and colors, giving it a decorative appearance. These elements are embedded into the surface in a seemingly random pattern. At the top of the object, there are two protruding structures that resemble handles or knobs. The overall design suggests that the object might have a symbolic or artistic purpose rather than a functional one."
