    "options": "['is commonly associated with Von Hippel Lindau', 'contains inhibin A positive stromal cells', 'is rich in reticulin', 'all are correct']",

    "description": "The image depicts a histological section of a tissue sample, likely from the cerebellum. The tissue appears to have a dense cellular structure with numerous small, round cells that have darkly stained nuclei. There are also some larger cells with more prominent nuclei interspersed among the smaller cells. The overall appearance suggests a highly cellular and possibly neoplastic process. The presence of reticulin fibers, which are often highlighted by specific staining techniques, is not directly visible in this image. However, the dense cellular arrangement and the presence of both small and large cells are characteristic features that may be associated with certain types of lesions in the cerebellum."
