    "description": "The image depicts a wooden specimen being subjected to a tension test. The specimen is gripped at both ends by metal fixtures, which apply a tensile force \\( P \\) in opposite directions. The dimensions of the specimen are provided: it has a width of 2 inches and a thickness of 1 inch. The length of the specimen between the grips is 4 inches. Section a-a is indicated on the specimen, which is where the average shear stress needs to be determined. The average normal stress applied to the specimen is given as 2 ksi (kilopounds per square inch)."
