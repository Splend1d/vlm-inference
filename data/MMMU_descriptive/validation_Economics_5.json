    "description": "The image is a graphical representation of an economy's aggregate demand (AD) and aggregate supply (AS) curves. The vertical axis represents the price level, while the horizontal axis represents real output (rY). There are three main curves in the graph:\n\n1. **AD Curve**: This is the aggregate demand curve, which slopes downward from left to right. It shows the relationship between the price level and the quantity of goods and services demanded in the economy.\n\n2. **SRAS Curve**: This is the short-run aggregate supply curve, which slopes upward from left to right. It shows the relationship between the price level and the quantity of goods and services supplied in the short run.\n\n3. **LRAS Curve**: This is the long-run aggregate supply curve, which is vertical. It represents the potential output of the economy in the long run, where all prices and wages have adjusted fully.\n\nPoint A is the intersection of the AD curve and the SRAS curve, indicating the current equilibrium in the economy. The LRAS curve intersects the SRAS curve at this point, suggesting that the economy is currently at its long-run equilibrium.\n\nGiven this setup, if the economy faces a boom (an increase in aggregate demand), the AD curve would shift to the right. However, the question asks how the economy returns to long-run equilibrium if wages are flexible. \n\nIn the context of flexible wages, if there is a boom, wages will adjust to bring the economy back to its long-run equilibrium. Specifically, if wages are flexible, they will rise to reduce the excess demand and bring the economy back to its long-run potential output.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to the question is:\nB. Wages will rise."
