    "description": "The image depicts a cross-sectional view of a gallbladder with numerous small, yellowish-brown stones scattered throughout its interior. The stones vary in size and appear to be embedded within the gallbladder wall. The gallbladder itself is partially opened, revealing the presence of these stones. A ruler is placed next to the gallbladder, indicating that the stones are approximately 1-2 centimeters in diameter. The overall appearance suggests a condition known as cholelithiasis, which is the presence of gallstones in the gallbladder."
