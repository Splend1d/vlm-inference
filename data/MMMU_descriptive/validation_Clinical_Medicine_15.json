    "description": "The image is an X-ray of a knee joint. The X-ray shows significant narrowing of the joint space between the bones, which suggests cartilage loss. There is also visible bone spurring (osteophytes) around the joint margins. These characteristics are indicative of degenerative changes typically seen in osteoarthritis. The bones appear to have maintained their overall structure without signs of acute inflammation or infection that would suggest septic arthritis. There is no evidence of the symmetrical joint involvement or periarticular osteopenia that is characteristic of rheumatoid arthritis. Additionally, there are no signs of the bone density changes or collapse that would indicate avascular necrosis.\n\nBased on these observations, the most likely diagnosis for the patient shown in the image is:\n\nA. Osteoarthritis"
