    "options": "['1.6*10^(-3) mm/mm', '1.2*10^(-3) mm/mm', '16.8*10^(-3) mm/mm', '12.8*10^(-3) mm/mm']",

    "description": "The image depicts a rectangular piece of plastic with dimensions of 400 mm in length (x-axis) and 300 mm in height (y-axis). The original shape of the rectangle is shown with dashed lines, while the deformed shape is shown with solid lines. The deformation is indicated by the movement of points A, B, C, and D.\n\n- Point A moves from its original position to a new position 2 mm to the right and 2 mm up.\n- Point B moves from its original position to a new position 5 mm to the right and 4 mm up.\n- Point C moves from its original position to a new position 2 mm to the left and 2 mm down.\n- Point D remains at its original position.\n\nThe diagonal AC is the line connecting points A and C. The original length of the diagonal AC can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem since the rectangle's sides are perpendicular to each other. The change in length of the diagonal AC can be determined by measuring the displacement of points A and C relative to their original positions.\n\nTo find the average normal strain along the diagonal AC, we need to calculate the change in length of the diagonal and divide it by the original length of the diagonal."
