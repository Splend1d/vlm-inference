    "question": "The chandelier is suspended from the wall and ceiling using rods AB and BC, which have diameters of 3 mm and 4 mm, respectively. If the average normal stress in both rods is not allowed to exceed 150 MPa, determine the largest mass of the chandelier that can be supported if u = 45. <image 1>",

    "description": "The image depicts a chandelier suspended from a ceiling using two rods labeled AB and BC. Rod AB is attached to the wall at point A and makes an angle of 30 degrees with the horizontal. Rod BC is attached to the ceiling at point C and makes an angle \u03b8 with the horizontal. The chandelier is hanging from point B, where the two rods meet. The rods have diameters of 3 mm (rod AB) and 4 mm (rod BC), respectively. The average normal stress in both rods is not allowed to exceed 150 MPa. The task is to determine the largest mass of the chandelier that can be supported if the angle \u03b8 is 45 degrees."
