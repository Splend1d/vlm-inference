    "description": "The image shows an electrocardiogram (ECG) tracing with a series of irregularly spaced, wide QRS complexes. The baseline appears to be erratic and chaotic, with no discernible P waves preceding the QRS complexes. The amplitude and morphology of the QRS complexes vary significantly throughout the tracing. This pattern is indicative of a highly irregular and disorganized electrical activity in the heart."
