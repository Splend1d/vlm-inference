    "question": "Using the scale bar, estimate the diameter of the vacuole in <image 1>.",
    "options": "['5.0 nm', '50 um', '7.5 um', '5.2 um']",
    "id": "validation_Biology_2",
    "description": "The image shows a microscopic view of cellular structures, specifically highlighting a vacuole within a cell. The vacuole appears as a dark, circular region within the cell. There is a scale bar in the image labeled \"5 \u00b5m,\" indicating the length of the bar is 5 micrometers (\u00b5m). The vacuole is approximately the same size as this scale bar, suggesting its diameter is close to 5 \u00b5m."
