    "description": "The image depicts a mechanical device with a lever system used for punching metal studs. The device consists of a handle that is bent at various angles and connected to a base through a pin labeled \"A.\" The handle has several segments with specific lengths and angles:\n\n- The handle extends from the hand grip to point D, which is 300 mm away.\n- From point D to point E, the handle is 100 mm long.\n- From point E to point B, the handle is 50 mm long.\n- The angle between the handle segment DE and the vertical is 30 degrees.\n- The angle between the handle segment EB and the vertical is 60 degrees.\n\nThe force applied to the handle by the hand is 120 N, directed vertically downward at the hand grip.\n\nThe device also includes a vertical component labeled \"C,\" which is likely the part that applies force to the metal stud being punched. The distance from the pin A to the base of the device is 200 mm.\n\nThe question asks for the magnitude of the reactive force at the pin A due to the applied force of 120 N on the handle."
