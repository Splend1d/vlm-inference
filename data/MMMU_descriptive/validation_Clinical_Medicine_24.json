    "question": "The patient shown below has had abdominal pain for a week. What is the most likely diagnosis? <image 1> ",
    "options": "['Large bowel obstruction', 'Small bowel obstruction', 'Generalized ileus', 'Localized ileus']",
    "id": "validation_Clinical_Medicine_24",
    "description": "The image is an X-ray of the abdomen. The X-ray shows multiple dilated loops of bowel with air-fluid levels, which are indicative of a mechanical obstruction. The dilated loops are primarily seen in the small intestine, suggesting that the obstruction is likely occurring in the small bowel rather than the large bowel. There is no evidence of generalized ileus or localized ileus, as the entire bowel is not uniformly dilated, and there is no specific focal point of dilation suggesting a localized issue.\n\nBased on this description, the most likely diagnosis is:\n\nB. Small bowel obstruction"
