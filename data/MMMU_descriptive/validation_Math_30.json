    "description": "The image shows a square labeled \\(ABCD\\) with side length \\(1\\). Inside this square, there is an equilateral convex hexagon labeled \\(APQCRS\\), where each side of the hexagon has length \\(s\\). The points \\(P\\), \\(Q\\), \\(R\\), and \\(S\\) lie on the sides of the square \\(ABCD\\).\n\n- Point \\(P\\) lies on side \\(AB\\).\n- Point \\(Q\\) lies on side \\(BC\\).\n- Point \\(R\\) lies on side \\(CD\\).\n- Point \\(S\\) lies on side \\(DA\\).\n\nThe hexagon \\(APQCRS\\) is formed by connecting these points in order. The sides of the hexagon are labeled with the variable \\(s\\), indicating that each side of the hexagon has the same length. The square \\(ABCD\\) is shaded in yellow, and the hexagon \\(APQCRS\\) is outlined in black. The vertices of the square and the hexagon are marked with black dots, and the labels \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), \\(D\\), \\(P\\), \\(Q\\), \\(R\\), and \\(S\\) are placed at their respective positions."
