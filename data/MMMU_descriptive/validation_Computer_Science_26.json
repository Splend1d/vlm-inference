    "question": "Suppose within your Web browser you click on a link to obtain a Web page. The IP address for the associated URL is not cached in your local host, so a DNS lookup is necessary to obtain the IP address. Suppose that four DNS servers are visited before your host receives the IP address from DNS. The first DNS server visited is the local DNS cache, with an RTT delay of RTT0 = 4 msecs. The second, third and fourth DNS servers contacted have RTTs of 14, 9, and 34 msecs, respectively. Initially, let's suppose that the Web page associated with the link contains exactly one object, consisting of a small amount of HTML text. Suppose the RTT between the local host and the Web server containing the object is RTTHTTP = 95 msecs. <image 1> Assuming zero transmission time for the HTML object, how much time (in msec) elapses from when the client clicks on the link until the client receives the object?Only write the number.",

    "description": "The image depicts a network diagram illustrating the process of a DNS lookup and subsequent HTTP request. Here are the details:\n\n1. **Client**: A computer or device initiating the request.\n2. **Local DNS Cache**: A server that stores recently resolved domain names and their corresponding IP addresses.\n3. **DNS Servers**: Three additional DNS servers labeled as DNS1, DNS2, and DNS3.\n4. **HTTP Server**: The server hosting the web page content.\n\nThe diagram shows the round-trip times (RTTs) between different components:\n- **RTT0**: The RTT between the client and the local DNS cache.\n- **RTT1**: The RTT between the local DNS cache and DNS1.\n- **RTT2**: The RTT between DNS1 and DNS2.\n- **RTT3**: The RTT between DNS2 and DNS3.\n- **RTT_HTTP**: The RTT between the client and the HTTP server.\n\nThe arrows indicate the direction of the requests and responses, showing the path taken by the DNS queries and the final HTTP request.\n\nBased on the given values:\n- RTT0 = 4 ms (milliseconds)\n- RTT1 = 14 ms\n- RTT2 = 9 ms\n- RTT3 = 34 ms\n- RTT_HTTP = 95 ms\n\nTo calculate the total time elapsed from when the client clicks on the link until the client receives the object, we need to sum up all the RTTs involved in the process:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Time} = RTT0 + RTT1 + RTT2 + RTT3 + RTT_HTTP \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Time} = 4 + 14 + 9 + 34 + 95 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Time} = 156 \\text{ ms} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total time elapsed is 156 milliseconds."
