    "description": "The image is a graph with two curves labeled \"Curve 1\" and \"Curve 2.\" The x-axis represents the Unemployment Rate (%) ranging from 0 to 10, and the y-axis represents the Inflation Rate (%) ranging from 0 to 10. \n\nCurve 1 is a vertical line at an unemployment rate of approximately 6%. Curve 2 is a downward-sloping line that intersects several points labeled A, B, C, D, and E. Point B is located at an unemployment rate of approximately 6% and an inflation rate of approximately 3%.\n\nIf the economy starts at point B and the money supply growth rate increases, in the long run, the economy would move along Curve 2. Since Curve 2 is downward sloping, an increase in the money supply growth rate would typically lead to higher inflation and lower unemployment. Therefore, the economy would move to a point with a higher inflation rate and a lower unemployment rate than point B.\n\nGiven the options:\nA. moves to C.\nB. moves to D.\nC. stays at B.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nA. moves to C."
