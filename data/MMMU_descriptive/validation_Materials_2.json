    "description": "The image depicts a rectangular bar with a cross-sectional area labeled \\( A \\). The bar is subjected to an axial load \\( P \\) applied at both ends, indicated by arrows pointing in opposite directions. Inside the bar, there is a shaded section oriented at an angle \\( \\theta \\) from the horizontal. This shaded section represents the area over which the average normal stresses are to be determined."
