    "question": "Consider the scenario shown below, with four different servers connected to four different clients over four three-hop paths. The four pairs share a common middle hop with a transmission capacity of R = 300 Mbps. The four links from the servers to the shared link have a transmission capacity of RS = 80 Mbps. Each of the four links from the shared middle link to a client has a transmission capacity of RC = 60 Mbps. <image 1> What is the maximum achievable end-end throughput (in Mbps) for each of four client-to-server pairs, assuming that the middle link is fairly shared (divides its transmission rate equally)? Omit the unit of Mbps.",

    "description": "The image depicts a network topology with four servers and four clients connected through a central hub. Each server is connected to the central hub via a link with a transmission capacity of \\( R_S = 80 \\) Mbps. Similarly, each client is connected to the central hub via a link with a transmission capacity of \\( R_C = 60 \\) Mbps. The central hub itself has a total transmission capacity of \\( R = 300 \\) Mbps.\n\nThe network is arranged in such a way that there are four distinct paths from each server to each client, all passing through the central hub. This setup implies that the central hub acts as a bottleneck for the data flow between servers and clients.\n\nGiven this configuration, the maximum achievable end-to-end throughput for each of the four client-to-server pairs can be determined by considering the capacities of the links involved and the fair sharing of the central hub's capacity.\n\nSince the central hub has a total capacity of \\( R = 300 \\) Mbps and it is shared equally among the four paths, each path gets an equal share of the hub's capacity. Therefore, the maximum achievable end-to-end throughput for each client-to-server pair is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{R}{4} = \\frac{300}{4} = 75 \\]\n\nThus, the maximum achievable end-to-end throughput for each of the four client-to-server pairs is 75 Mbps."
