    "description": "The image depicts a kitchen layout diagram with various elements labeled. The kitchen features a sink, stove, and refrigerator arranged in an L-shape. There is a dashed line labeled \"WORK TRIANGLE\" connecting these three appliances, indicating the primary workflow area in the kitchen. Additionally, there is another dashed line labeled \"TRAFFIC PATTERN\" that runs from one side of the kitchen to the other, suggesting the path people might take when moving through the space. The traffic pattern does not intersect the work triangle, which is important for efficient kitchen design."
