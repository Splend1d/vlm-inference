    "description": "The image appears to be a medical scan, likely an MRI or CT scan, showing a cross-sectional view of the human head. The scan focuses on the area around the brainstem and inner ear structures. There is a yellow arrow pointing to a specific region within the scan, indicating a potential abnormality or area of interest. This region is located near the cerebellum and brainstem, which are involved in balance and hearing functions. The arrow suggests that there might be a tumor or other pathology affecting these areas."
