    "question": "This condition may be seen in association with all of the following except <image 1>",
    "options": "['Carcinoma of the breast', 'Medullary carcinoma of the thyroid gland', 'Tricholemmomas of the face', 'Macrocephaly']",

    "description": "The image depicts a histological section of tissue stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). The tissue appears to have a characteristic pattern of multiple nodules or masses, which are irregularly shaped and vary in size. The nodules are separated by connective tissue stroma. The staining shows a pinkish hue, indicating the presence of eosinophilic material, likely keratin or other proteinaceous substances. The overall appearance suggests a pathological condition involving abnormal growth or proliferation of cells within the tissue.\n\nBased on this description, the condition depicted in the image could be associated with various conditions, including:\n\nA. Carcinoma of the breast\nB. Medullary carcinoma of the thyroid gland\nC. Tricholemmomas of the face\nD. Macrocephaly\n\nHowever, macrocephaly (option D) is a condition characterized by an abnormally large head size and does not typically involve the histological features observed in the image. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Macrocephaly"
