    "options": "['<image 1>', '<image 2>', '<image 3>', '<image 4>', '<image 5>']",
    "id": "validation_Psychology_1",
    "description": "The image consists of five graphs labeled (A) through (E), each depicting the relationship between performance and arousal level. \n\n- Graph (A) shows a bell-shaped curve with performance increasing to a peak at moderate arousal levels and then decreasing as arousal increases further.\n- Graph (B) shows an inverted U-shaped curve with performance decreasing as arousal increases from low to high.\n- Graph (C) shows a horizontal line indicating that performance remains constant regardless of the arousal level.\n- Graph (D) shows a straight line with a positive slope, indicating that performance increases linearly with increasing arousal.\n- Graph (E) shows a straight line with a negative slope, indicating that performance decreases linearly with increasing arousal.\n\nBased on these descriptions, the correct answer to the question would be:\n\nA. Graph (A) best depicts the relation between performance and arousal."
