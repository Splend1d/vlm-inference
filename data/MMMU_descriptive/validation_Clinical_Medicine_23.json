    "description": "The image is an abdominal radiograph, which shows the internal structures of the abdomen using X-ray imaging. The spine is visible running vertically down the center of the image. The kidneys are located on either side of the spine, appearing as bean-shaped structures. The liver is not distinctly visible in this type of imaging but is typically located in the upper right quadrant of the abdomen. The small intestines appear as a series of loops and gas-filled areas throughout the abdominal cavity. Based on the visible structures, the kidneys appear to be abnormally large compared to their typical size."
