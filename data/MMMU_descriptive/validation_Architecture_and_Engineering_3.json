    "description": "The image shows a table with data related to a section of base line measured by a tape hung in catenary. The table has four columns:\n\n1. **Bay**: This column lists the bay numbers from 1 to 5.\n2. **Observed length (m)**: This column lists the observed lengths of the tape in meters for each bay. The values are:\n   - Bay 1: 30.034 m\n   - Bay 2: 30.109 m\n   - Bay 3: 30.198 m\n   - Bay 4: 30.075 m\n   - Bay 5: 30.121 m\n3. **Mean temperature (\u00b0C)**: This column lists the mean temperatures in degrees Celsius for each bay. The values are:\n   - Bay 1: 25.2 \u00b0C\n   - Bay 2: 25.4 \u00b0C\n   - Bay 3: 25.1 \u00b0C\n   - Bay 4: 25.0 \u00b0C\n   - Bay 5: 24.8 \u00b0C\n4. **Reduced levels of index marks (m)**: This column lists two sets of reduced levels of index marks in meters for each bay. The values are:\n   - Bay 1: 293.235 m and 293.610 m\n   - Bay 2: 293.610 m and 294.030 m\n   - Bay 3: 294.030 m and 294.498 m\n   - Bay 4: 294.498 m and 294.000 m\n   - Bay 5: 294.000 m and 293.355 m\n\nThe table provides measurements for different bays, including the observed length of the tape, the mean temperature during the measurement, and the reduced levels of index marks for each bay."
