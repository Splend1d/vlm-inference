    "description": "The image depicts a rectangular block subjected to two equal and opposite forces of 500 lb each, applied along the centroidal axis of the member. The forces are acting horizontally, one pulling to the left and the other pushing to the right. There is a section labeled \"a-a\" passing through a point marked as \"A,\" which is inclined at an angle of 30 degrees from the vertical. The section \"a-a\" divides the block into two parts, with the shaded area representing the cross-section of interest. The forces are applied symmetrically about the centroidal axis, indicating that the resultant internal normal force (Na) and shear force (Va) can be determined by considering the equilibrium of the forces acting on the block."
