    "description": "The image depicts a flat aluminum alloy bar that is fixed at both ends. The bar is divided into three segments: AB, B, and BC. \n\n- Segment AB is a tapered section with a length of \\( L/2 \\) (where \\( L = 3 \\) ft). The width at point A is \\( b_2 = 2.5 \\) inches, and the width at point B is \\( b_1 = 2 \\) inches.\n- Segment B is a transition point between the tapered section and the uniform section.\n- Segment BC is a uniform section with a length of \\( L/2 \\) (where \\( L = 3 \\) ft) and a constant width of \\( b_1 = 2 \\) inches.\n\nThe bar is subjected to a uniform temperature increase of \\( \\Delta T = 20^\\circ F \\). The material properties provided include:\n- Length \\( L = 3 \\) ft\n- Thickness \\( t = 1/4 \\) inch\n- Widths \\( b_1 = 2 \\) inches and \\( b_2 = 2.5 \\) inches\n- Young's modulus \\( E = 10,400 \\) ksi\n- Coefficient of thermal expansion \\( \\alpha = 13 \\times 10^{-6} / ^\\circ F \\)\n\nThe goal is to find the reactions at points A and C when the temperature of the bar is raised uniformly by \\( \\Delta T = 20^\\circ F \\)."
