    "description": "The image depicts a scenario involving a rocket launched from the top of a tower. The tower has a height labeled as \\( h \\). The rocket is launched at an angle of 45 degrees above the horizontal. The trajectory of the rocket is shown as a curved path, indicating it follows a parabolic arc. The rocket hits the ground at a horizontal distance from the foot of the tower, which is labeled as \\( 3h \\). This means the horizontal distance traveled by the rocket is three times the height of the tower. The time it takes for the rocket to hit the ground is given as 5 seconds."
