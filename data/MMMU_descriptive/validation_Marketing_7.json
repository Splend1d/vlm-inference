    "description": "The image shows a table with two columns labeled \"X\" and \"Freq.\" The table lists the frequency of different values of X, which represents the number of colors on national flags. The rows are as follows:\n\n- X = 1, Freq. = 1\n- X = 2, Freq. = 7\n- X = 3, Freq. = 18\n- X = 4, Freq. = 7\n- X = 5, Freq. = 6\n\nThe total number of observations (national flags surveyed) is 39, which is the sum of all frequencies: 1 + 7 + 18 + 7 + 6 = 39."
