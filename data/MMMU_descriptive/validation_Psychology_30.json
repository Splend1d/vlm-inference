    "description": "The image consists of five different graphs labeled A through E, each depicting the relationship between a person's level of arousal and their performance on a challenging task. \n\n- **Graph A** shows a U-shaped curve where performance decreases as arousal increases to a certain point, then increases again.\n- **Graph B** shows a straight line with a negative slope, indicating that performance decreases linearly as arousal increases.\n- **Graph C** shows a V-shaped curve where performance decreases sharply as arousal increases to a certain point, then increases sharply again.\n- **Graph D** shows a straight line with a positive slope, indicating that performance increases linearly as arousal increases.\n- **Graph E** shows an inverted U-shaped curve where performance increases as arousal increases up to a certain point, then decreases as arousal continues to increase.\n\nEach graph has \"Performance\" on the y-axis and \"Arousal\" on the x-axis."
