    "question": "Which reaction in the following reaction sequence <image 1> is regioselective?",
    "options": "[]",
    "id": "validation_Pharmacy_19",
    "description": "The image depicts a multi-step chemical reaction sequence involving organic compounds. The sequence consists of four steps labeled A, B, C, and D. Each step involves different reagents and results in structural changes to the starting compound.\n\n- **Step A**: The starting compound has an ester group (CO2Et), a hydroxyl group (OH), and a mesylate (OMs) group attached to a cyclohexene ring. In this step, sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) is used, which likely deprotonates the hydroxyl group, forming an alkoxide ion.\n\n- **Step B**: The product from Step A reacts with sodium azide (NaN3) and ammonium chloride (NH4Cl). This step likely involves nucleophilic substitution, where the azide ion replaces the mesylate group.\n\n- **Step C**: The product from Step B reacts with triphenylphosphine (PPh3) and triethylamine (NEt3). This step likely involves reduction of the azide group to form an amine.\n\n- **Step D**: The final step involves reacting the product from Step C with methanesulfonyl chloride (MeSO2Cl). This step likely involves converting the amine group into an amide or sulfonamide.\n\nBased on the description, the reaction that is regioselective is **Step B**. Regioselectivity refers to the preference for one reaction site over another when there are two or more possible sites for a reaction. In Step B, the azide ion specifically replaces the mesylate group, demonstrating regioselectivity."
