    "question": "Using the oxygen affinity curve in <image 1>, determine the amount of oxygen that would be delivered to cells at PO2 = 20 mmHg if the PO2 of the lungs were 60 mmHg. Assume maximum HbO2 to be the level of oxygen delivery if all available oxygen in the RBC's was transferred to cells.",
    "options": "['17% of the maximum HbO2 would be delivered.', '22% of the maximum HbO2 would be delivered.', '65% of the maximum HbO2 would be delivered.', '70% of the maximum HbO2 would be delivered.', '82% of the maximum HbO2 would be delivered.']",

    "description": "The image is a graph representing the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve. The x-axis is labeled \"PO2 (mmHg)\" and ranges from 0 to 120 mmHg. The y-axis is labeled \"Oxyhemoglobin saturation (%)\" and ranges from 0% to 100%. The curve starts at the bottom left corner and rises steeply as it moves to the right, eventually leveling off towards the top right corner. The curve shows the relationship between the partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) and the percentage of hemoglobin saturated with oxygen (oxyhemoglobin saturation). At lower PO2 values, the curve rises sharply, indicating a rapid increase in oxyhemoglobin saturation. As the PO2 increases, the curve flattens out, approaching 100% saturation."
