    "description": "The image is an informational graphic titled \"MINORITY GROUPS.\" It provides an overview and examples of minority groups in society. The overview section explains that minority groups refer to social categories consisting of individuals who possess distinct characteristics or attributes that differentiate them from the dominant or majority group within a particular society. These characteristics can include race, ethnicity, religion, language, gender, sexual orientation, or socioeconomic status. The examples section lists three types of minority groups: Linguistic Minorities (e.g., the Francophone community in Canada), Gender Diverse People (e.g., trans people facing discrimination for not conforming to binary gender identities), and Religious minorities (e.g., historically, people who don't conform to dominant religions have faced discrimination). The image also states that a minority group is a distinct group of people in society who lack the collective numbers to sufficiently be protected from discrimination from society's dominant groups."
