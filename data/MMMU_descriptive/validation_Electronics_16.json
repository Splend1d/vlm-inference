    "description": "The image consists of three separate electrical circuits labeled (a), (b), and (c). Each circuit includes resistors, inductors, and voltage sources, with switches that are closed at \\( t = 0 \\).\n\n1. **Circuit (a)**:\n   - The circuit has a 12V battery connected to a series combination of a 6\u03a9 resistor and a 4\u03a9 resistor.\n   - There is a 2H inductor in parallel with the 4\u03a9 resistor.\n   - A switch is shown being closed at \\( t = 0 \\).\n   - The current \\( i \\) is flowing through the inductor.\n\n2. **Circuit (b)**:\n   - The circuit has a 100V battery connected to a series combination of a 30\u03a9 resistor and a 20\u03a9 resistor.\n   - There is a 5H inductor in parallel with the 20\u03a9 resistor.\n   - A switch is shown being closed at \\( t = 0 \\).\n   - The current \\( i \\) is flowing through the inductor.\n\n3. **Circuit (c)**:\n   - The circuit has a 5A current source connected to a parallel combination of a 20\u03a9 resistor and a 10\u03a9 resistor.\n   - There is an 8H inductor in parallel with the 10\u03a9 resistor.\n   - A switch is shown being closed at \\( t = 0 \\).\n   - The current \\( i \\) is flowing through the inductor.\n\nTo find the voltage \\( v \\) in circuit (c) just after the switch is thrown, we need to consider the behavior of the inductor. An inductor resists changes in current, so immediately after the switch is closed, the current through the inductor remains zero. Therefore, the entire 5A current from the current source flows through the 20\u03a9 resistor.\n\nUsing Ohm's Law (\\( V = IR \\)), we can calculate the voltage across the 20\u03a9 resistor:\n\n\\[ V = I \\times R = 5A \\times 20\u03a9 = 100V \\]\n\nThus, the voltage \\( v \\) in circuit (c) just after the switch is thrown is 100V."
