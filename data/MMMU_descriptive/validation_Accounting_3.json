    "description": "The image is a table comparing the cash flows for two mutually exclusive projects, Project A and Project B, over a period of four years (Year 0 to Year 3). The table is structured as follows:\n\n- **Year**: This column lists the years from 0 to 3.\n- **Project A**: This column shows the cash flows for Project A in each year.\n- **Project B**: This column shows the cash flows for Project B in each year.\n\nHere are the specific values for each project:\n\n**Project A:**\n- Year 0: -\\$20,000\n- Year 1: \\$13,200\n- Year 2: \\$8,300\n- Year 3: \\$3,200\n\n**Project B:**\n- Year 0: -\\$24,000\n- Year 1: \\$14,100\n- Year 2: \\$9,800\n- Year 3: \\$7,600\n\nTo determine which project should be chosen using the NPV rule with a discount rate of 15%, you would need to calculate the Net Present Value (NPV) for both projects and choose the one with the higher NPV."
