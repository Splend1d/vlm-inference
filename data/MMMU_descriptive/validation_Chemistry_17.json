    "question": "Among the following, the Newmann projections of meso-2, 3-butanediol are : <image 1>",
    "options": "['P, Q', 'P, R', 'R, S', 'Q, S']",
    "id": "validation_Chemistry_17",
    "description": "The image shows four Newman projections labeled P, Q, R, and S. Each projection represents a different orientation of the same molecule, meso-2,3-butanediol. The projections are drawn with a central carbon atom (C) at the intersection of two lines, representing the bonds to other atoms. The atoms bonded to the central carbon are represented by their symbols: H (hydrogen), Me (methyl group, which stands for CH\u2083), and OH (hydroxyl group).\n\n- **Projection P**: The front bond points down and to the left, showing an OH group. The back bond points up and to the right, showing an H atom. The top bond points up and to the left, showing a Me group. The bottom bond points down and to the right, showing an OH group.\n- **Projection Q**: The front bond points down and to the left, showing an OH group. The back bond points up and to the right, showing an H atom. The top bond points up and to the left, showing a Me group. The bottom bond points down and to the right, showing an OH group.\n- **Projection R**: The front bond points down and to the left, showing an OH group. The back bond points up and to the right, showing an H atom. The top bond points up and to the left, showing a Me group. The bottom bond points down and to the right, showing an OH group.\n- **Projection S**: The front bond points down and to the left, showing an OH group. The back bond points up and to the right, showing an H atom. The top bond points up and to the left, showing a Me group. The bottom bond points down and to the right, showing an OH group.\n\nAll four projections show the same arrangement of atoms around the central carbon, indicating that they represent the same molecule, meso-2,3-butanediol."
