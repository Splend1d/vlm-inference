    "description": "The image appears to be a cross-sectional view of the brain, specifically focusing on the internal capsule region. The internal capsule is a large band of white matter fibers that connects various parts of the brain. In this image, you can see the anterior limb, genu, and posterior limb of the internal capsule. The pallidothalamic axons, which connect the globus pallidus to the thalamus, typically cross through the posterior limb of the internal capsule."
