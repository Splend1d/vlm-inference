    "description": "The image depicts a structural engineering diagram of a high-strength precast concrete column with two horizontal beams attached at different levels. The column is divided into three sections: from the top (A) to the middle (B), and from the middle (B) to the bottom (C). \n\n- **Top Section (A to B):**\n  - The column has a height of 10 feet.\n  - The cross-sectional dimensions at this section (a-a) are 6 inches by 6 inches.\n  - Two forces, labeled \\( P_1 \\), are applied vertically downward at the top of the column.\n\n- **Middle Section (B to C):**\n  - The column also has a height of 10 feet.\n  - The cross-sectional dimensions at this section (b-b) are 10 inches by 10 inches.\n  - Two forces, labeled \\( P_2 \\), are applied vertically downward at the middle of the column.\n\n- **Bottom Section (C):**\n  - The column is anchored at the base (C).\n\nThe question provides additional information about the vertical displacements:\n- The vertical displacement of end A relative to B is 0.08 inches.\n- The vertical displacement of end B relative to C is 0.1 inches.\n\nBased on this description, the question asks for the magnitude of \\( P_1 \\)."
