    "description": "The image shows a Lewis structure of a molecule or ion. The central atom is bonded to four other atoms, each represented by a circle with a pair of dots (representing lone pairs of electrons) on either side. The arrangement of these atoms around the central atom forms a square planar geometry. Each corner of the square represents one of the bonded atoms, and the central atom is at the intersection of the lines connecting these corners."
