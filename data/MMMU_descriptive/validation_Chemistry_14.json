    "question": "How many chiral center (excluding N centres) are there in morphine? <image 1>",
    "options": "['4', '5', '6', 'More than 6']",
    "id": "validation_Chemistry_14",
    "description": "The image depicts the chemical structure of morphine. The structure consists of several rings interconnected with various functional groups. Specifically, there are two hydroxyl groups (OH) attached to the aromatic ring, one at the top left and another at the bottom left. There is also an oxygen atom (O) bridging two of the rings. Additionally, there is a nitrogen atom (N) bonded to a methyl group (CH3) and another hydrogen atom (H). The structure includes multiple carbon atoms, some of which are part of the rings and others that are bonded to the functional groups.\n\nTo determine the number of chiral centers (excluding nitrogen centers), we need to identify the carbon atoms that have four different substituents attached to them. In this structure, there are five such carbon atoms: one at the top right of the central ring, one at the bottom right of the central ring, one at the bottom left of the central ring, one at the top left of the central ring, and one at the bottom left of the upper ring.\n\nTherefore, the number of chiral centers (excluding nitrogen centers) in morphine is 5."
