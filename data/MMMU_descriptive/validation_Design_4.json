    "description": "The image depicts an abstract painting featuring a series of nested squares. The outermost square is light blue, followed by a gray square, then a white square, and finally a yellow square at the center. The composition is simple yet striking, with clean lines and solid colors. This style is reminiscent of the work of Josef Albers, a renowned artist and educator known for his contributions to color theory and geometric abstraction."
