    "description": "The image depicts an electrochemical cell consisting of two half-cells connected by a salt bridge and a voltmeter. The left half-cell contains a zinc (Zn) electrode immersed in a 1.0 M solution of zinc ions (Zn\u00b2\u207a). The right half-cell contains a silver (Ag) electrode immersed in a 1.0 M solution of silver ions (Ag\u207a). The voltmeter is connected to both electrodes to measure the potential difference between them.\n\nAdditionally, there is a table provided with standard reduction potentials for the half-reactions associated with the electrochemical cell:\n\n- The first half-reaction is Ag\u207a(aq) + e\u207b \u2192 Ag(s), with a standard reduction potential (E\u00b0) of +0.80 V.\n- The second half-reaction is Zn\u00b2\u207a(aq) + 2e\u207b \u2192 Zn(s), with a standard reduction potential (E\u00b0) of -0.76 V.\n\nBased on these details, the net ionic equation for the overall reaction that occurs as the cell operates can be determined by combining the two half-reactions appropriately."
