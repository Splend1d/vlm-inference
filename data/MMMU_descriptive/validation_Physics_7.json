    "options": "['the eccentricity of the orbit is less thatn zero', 'the eccentricity of the orbit is greater than 1', 'the sun might be at point C', 'the sun might be at point D', 'the sun might be at point B']",

    "description": "The image shows an elliptical orbit with five labeled points: A, B, C, D, and E. Point E is located at one of the foci of the ellipse, which is where the Sun would be in a planetary orbit. Points A, B, C, and D are distributed along the ellipse, with B being closer to the center of the ellipse and C being further away from it. The ellipse is elongated, indicating that it has a non-zero eccentricity."
