    "description": "The image depicts a geometric diagram involving a satellite station \\( S \\) and a triangulation station \\( A \\). The satellite station \\( S \\) is located 12 meters away from station \\( A \\). From station \\( S \\), bearings to points \\( B \\), \\( C \\), and \\( D \\) are observed, and the distances between these points and station \\( A \\) are measured.\n\n- **Point \\( A \\)**: This is the triangulation station.\n- **Point \\( S \\)**: This is the satellite station, located 12 meters directly below point \\( A \\).\n- **Point \\( B \\)**: Located at a bearing of 143\u00b036'20\" from station \\( S \\) and a distance of 3190.32 meters from station \\( A \\).\n- **Point \\( C \\)**: Located at a bearing of 238\u00b024'48\" from station \\( S \\) and a distance of 4085.15 meters from station \\( A \\).\n- **Point \\( D \\)**: Located at a bearing of 307\u00b018'54\" from station \\( S \\) and a distance of 3108.60 meters from station \\( A \\).\n\nThe diagram includes angles \\( \\theta_1 \\), \\( \\theta_2 \\), \\( \\theta_3 \\), and \\( \\alpha_1 \\), \\( \\alpha_2 \\), \\( \\alpha_3 \\) which represent the angles between the lines connecting the points. These angles are used to determine the directions of points \\( B \\), \\( C \\), and \\( D \\) from station \\( A \\).\n\nBased on the given information and the diagram, the correct answer for the directions of \\( B \\), \\( C \\), and \\( D \\) from \\( A \\) is:\n\n**A.
