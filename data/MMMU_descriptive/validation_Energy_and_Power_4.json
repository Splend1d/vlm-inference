    "description": "The image depicts a simple thermodynamic system involving the expansion of Refrigerant-134a (R-134a). The system consists of a pipe with a valve in the middle. On the left side of the valve, the R-134a is at a pressure of 100 psia and a temperature of 100\u00b0F. The arrow pointing towards the valve indicates the direction of flow of the refrigerant. On the right side of the valve, the pressure is indicated as 10 psia. The image does not provide any additional information about the temperature on the right side of the valve, but it states that the refrigerant expands adiabatically to a saturated vapor at 10 psia."
