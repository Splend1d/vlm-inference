    "description": "The image consists of four different chemical structures labeled (a), (b), (c), and (d). Each structure represents an isomer of a cyclohexane derivative with an OH group and an OMe (methoxy) group attached at different positions on the ring.\n\n- **(a)**: The OH group is in the axial position, and the OMe group is in the equatorial position.\n- **(b)**: The OH group is in the equatorial position, and the OMe group is in the axial position.\n- **(c)**: The OMe group is in the axial position, and the OH group is in the equatorial position.\n- **(d)**: Both the OH group and the OMe group are in the equatorial positions.\n\nTo determine the most stable isomer, we need to consider the stability of axial and equatorial groups in cyclohexane derivatives. Generally, equatorial substituents are more stable than axial substituents due to less steric hindrance and fewer 1,3-diaxial interactions.\n\nGiven this information, the most stable isomer would be the one where both substituents (OH and OMe) are in the equatorial positions.\n\nTherefore, the most stable isomer is:\n\nD. <image 4>"
