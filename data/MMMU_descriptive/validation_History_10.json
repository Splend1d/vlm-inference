    "description": "The image is a political cartoon titled \"The Crime of the Ages\u2014Who Did It?\" from 1914. It depicts several European nations, each represented by a figure labeled with their respective country names: England, Belgium, France, Italy, Serbia, Germany, Austria, and Russia. These figures are shown pointing fingers at each other, seemingly blaming one another for an event. In the background, there is a tombstone with a cross on top and a banner that reads \"The Peace of Europe.\" A large hand is pointing towards the scene from the left side of the image. The overall tone of the cartoon suggests a sense of accusation and blame among the nations depicted."
