    "description": "The image is a classification chart of sedimentary rocks divided into three subclasses: Clastic, Chemically Precipitated, and Organic. Each subclass is further broken down into specific rock types with accompanying photographs.\n\n1. **Clastic Subclass**:\n   - **Sandstone**: Composed of sand-sized rock and mineral fragments.\n   - **Siltstone**: Composed of silt-sized rock and mineral fragments.\n   - **Conglomerate**: Composed of rounded or sub-rounded gravel-sized rock and mineral fragments.\n   - **Mudstone**: Composed of very fine-grained rock and mineral fragments.\n   - **Claystone**: Composed of clay-sized rock and mineral fragments.\n   - **Shale**: Composed of clay-sized rock and mineral fragments, often breaking into thin layers.\n\n2. **Chemically Precipitated Subclass**:\n   - **Limestone**: Formed by chemical precipitation from seawater, sometimes with the help of micro-organisms.\n   - **Dolomite**: Similar to limestone but containing magnesium carbonate.\n   - **Chert**: A microcrystalline form of quartz.\n   - **Evaporites**: Formed from the evaporation of seawater.\n\n3. **Organic Subclass**:\n   - **Coal**: Formed from organic material.\n   - **Petroleum (mineral fuel)**: Formed from organic material.\n   - **Natural gas (mineral fuel)**: Formed from organic material.\n\nEach rock type is accompanied by a photograph showing its appearance in natural settings. The photographs are credited to various sources, including Bill Hatcher/NG Image Collection, Walter Meayers Edwards/NG Image Collection, Norbert Rosing/NG Image Collection, and Melissa Farlow/NG Image Collection."
