    "description": "The image shows a close-up view of a young ash tree with several corky outgrowths on its trunk. The tree is located by the roadside in Littondale, Yorkshire. The outgrowths appear to be rough and raised, with dark, almost blackened patches. Surrounding the trunk are green leaves and branches, indicating that the tree is still alive and growing. The background consists of more trees and foliage, suggesting a natural environment."
