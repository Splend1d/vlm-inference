    "description": "The image shows a scatter plot with three data points plotted on a Cartesian coordinate system. The x-axis is labeled \"X,\" and the y-axis is labeled \"h(x).\" The x-axis ranges from 0 to 3, and the y-axis ranges from 0 to 3. The three data points are marked with red \"X\" symbols at the following coordinates:\n\n1. (1, 1)\n2. (2, 2)\n3. (3, 3)\n\nThese points represent the training set with \\( m = 3 \\) examples."
