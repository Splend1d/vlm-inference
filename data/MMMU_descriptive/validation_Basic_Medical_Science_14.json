    "description": "The image illustrates the process of genetic engineering, specifically the transfer of a gene from a human cell to a bacterial cell using a plasmid vector. Here is a detailed description of the steps shown in the image:\n\n1. **Bacterial Cell with Plasmid**: The image starts with a bacterial cell containing a circular piece of DNA known as a plasmid.\n2. **Human Cell with Gene**: A human cell is depicted with a linear piece of DNA representing the gene for human growth hormone.\n3. **Isolation of Human Growth Hormone Gene**: The gene for human growth hormone is isolated from the human cell.\n4. **Opening the Plasmid**: The plasmid is opened, likely through restriction enzymes, to allow insertion of foreign DNA.\n5. **Insertion of Human Growth Hormone Gene into Plasmid**: The isolated gene for human growth hormone is inserted into the opened plasmid.\n6. **Closing the Plasmid**: The plasmid is closed again, incorporating the human growth hormone gene.\n7. **Transformation of Bacterial Cell**: The modified plasmid is introduced into the bacterial cell, resulting in the bacterial cell now containing the gene for human growth hormone.\n\nThis process is used to create genetically modified bacteria that can produce human growth hormone."
