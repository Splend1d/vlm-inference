    "description": "The image is a detailed anatomical illustration of a cross-section of the left leg. The section shows various muscles and structures within the leg. The muscles are labeled with numbers, and the specific number mentioned in the question is 170. \n\n- Label 166 points to the outermost layer, which appears to be the skin.\n- Label 167 indicates a large muscle located towards the top right of the section.\n- Label 168 points to a muscle located at the bottom right.\n- Label 169 indicates a muscle located towards the center-left of the section.\n- Label 170 points to a muscle located near the center of the section, slightly to the left.\n\nBased on the positioning and typical anatomy of the leg, label 170 corresponds to the tibialis anterior muscle, which is located in the anterior compartment of the leg and is responsible for dorsiflexion and inversion of the foot."
