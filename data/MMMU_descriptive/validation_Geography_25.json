    "options": "['The roll waterproof layer is laid on the upstream surface of the external wall', 'The roll waterproof layer is laid on the back surface of the external wall', 'The outer wall roll adopts the empty laying method', ' When laying double layer coils, the two layers of coils are perpendicular to each other']",

    "description": "The image depicts a technical drawing of a basement exterior wall with specific dimensions and details related to its construction. The drawing includes several sections labeled I-I, II-II, and III-III, indicating different views or cross-sections of the wall. Key measurements and annotations are provided throughout the drawing:\n\n1. **Overall Dimensions**: The total height of the wall is 1400 mm.\n2. **Wall Thickness**: The thickness of the wall is 250 mm at the base, tapering down to 120 mm at the top.\n3. **Waterproofing Layer**: There is a designated area for the waterproofing layer, which is shown as a separate layer applied to the exterior surface of the wall.\n4. **Additional Layers**: The drawing shows multiple layers, including a protective layer on the outside of the waterproofing layer.\n5. **Construction Details**: Specific dimensions and annotations indicate the placement and thickness of each layer, ensuring proper installation.\n\nBased on this description, the correct method for constructing the waterproofing layer of the basement exterior wall with coiled materials is:\n\n**A. The roll waterproof layer is laid on the upstream surface of the external wall**\n\nThis is because the waterproofing layer is shown applied directly to the exterior (upstream) surface of the wall in the drawing."
