    "description": "The image is a phase diagram with temperature on the x-axis and pressure on the y-axis. The diagram shows two curves that intersect at a point labeled \"7.\" Points \"1\" and \"5\" are located on the upper curve, while points \"2\" and \"4\" are located on the lower curve. Point \"3\" is on the upper curve but closer to the intersection point \"7.\" Points \"6\" and \"8\" are also on the upper and lower curves, respectively, but further away from the intersection point. Point \"9\" is located below both curves.\n\nBased on this description, the points that correspond to a melting/freezing equilibrium are those that lie on the intersection of the two curves, which is point \"7.\" Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nE. 7 and 8"
