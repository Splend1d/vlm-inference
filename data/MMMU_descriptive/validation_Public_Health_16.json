    "question": "The introduction of the oral contraceptive(OC) in the 1960s provided an additional effective means of family planning, but it also had unanticipated side effects, particularly the susceptibility to thromboembolism. Women taking OC had an increased risk of pulmonary, cerebral, and coronary thrombosis or embolism.A larger case-control study was conducted in the United States between 1976-1978 by Shapiro et al. to explore the relationship between OC use and myocardial infarction(MI) in women under 50 years of age.The age distribution of the MI and control groups and OC exposure among MI patients and controls in each age group were shown in the table below.<image 1> The 95% CI for OR in 25-29 years was",

    "description": "The image is a table that presents data from a case-control study conducted in the United States between 1976-1978 by Shapiro et al., exploring the relationship between oral contraceptive (OC) use and myocardial infarction (MI) in women under 50 years of age. The table is divided into several columns and rows, with the following structure:\n\n- **Age groups (years)**: This column lists different age ranges (25~, 30~, 35~, 40~, 45~49).\n- **MI group**: This column shows the number of cases in the myocardial infarction group within each age range.\n- **Control group**: This column shows the number of cases in the control group within each age range.\n- **OC exposure**:\n  - **MI**: This sub-column shows the number of cases in the myocardial infarction group who were exposed to OC within each age range.\n  - **Control**: This sub-column shows the number of cases in the control group who were exposed to OC within each age range.\n\nThe table also includes totals at the bottom for each column.\n\nHere are the specific numbers from the table:\n\n- **Age groups (years)**:\n  - 25~: \n    - MI group: 6 (2.6%)\n    - Control group: 286 (16.4%)\n    - OC exposure:\n      - MI: 4 (66.7%)\n      - Control: 62 (21.7%)\n  - 30~:\n    - MI group: 21 (9.0%)\n    - Control group: 423 (24.3%)\n    - OC exposure:\n      - MI: 9 (42.9%)\n      - Control: 33 (7.8%)\n  - 35~:\n    - MI group: 37 (15.8%)\n    - Control group: 356 (20.4%)\n    - OC exposure:\n      - MI: 4 (10.8%)\n      - Control: 26 (7.3%)\n  - 40~:\n    - MI group: 71 (30.3%)\n    - Control group: 371 (21.3%)\n    - OC exposure:\n      - MI: 6 (8.5%)\n      - Control: 9 (2.4%)\n  - 45~49:\n    - MI group: 99 (42.3%)\n    - Control group: 306 (17.6%)\n    - OC exposure:\n      - MI: 6 (6.1%)\n      - Control: 5 (1.6%)\n\n- **Total**:\n  - MI group: 234 (100.0%)\n  - Control group: 1742 (100.0%)\n  - OC exposure:\n    - MI: 29 (12.4%)\n    - Control: 135 (7.7%)"
