    "description": "The image depicts an electrolysis setup with two electrodes labeled A and B immersed in a liquid, likely water. The electrodes are connected to a power source, and bubbles are forming at both electrodes. The bubbles at electrode A are larger and more numerous compared to those at electrode B. This suggests that hydrogen gas is being produced at electrode A during the electrolysis process."
