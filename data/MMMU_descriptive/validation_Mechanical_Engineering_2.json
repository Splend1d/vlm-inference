    "options": "['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']",
    "id": "validation_Mechanical_Engineering_2",
    "description": "The image consists of two parts: a 3D object and four different views labeled A, B, C, and D.\n\n1. **3D Object**: The 3D object appears to be a bent pipe or tube with a right-angle bend. The pipe has a cylindrical shape and is shown in a perspective view where one end is pointing upwards and the other end is angled to the side.\n\n2. **Views (A, B, C, D)**:\n   - **View A**: This view shows the pipe from the top, looking directly down at the bend. The view is symmetrical with the bend forming a right angle.\n   - **View B**: This view shows the pipe from the front, looking straight at the bend. The view is also symmetrical with the bend forming a right angle.\n   - **View C**: This view shows the pipe from the side, looking at the bend. The view is asymmetrical, showing the bend at an angle.\n   - **View D**: This view shows the pipe from the back, looking through the bend. The view is symmetrical with the bend forming a right angle.\n\nBased on the description, the correct view is **View B** because it shows the pipe from the front, looking straight at the bend, which matches the orientation of the 3D object."
