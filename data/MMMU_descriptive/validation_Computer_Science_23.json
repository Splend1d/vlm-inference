    "question": "Suppose that TCP's current estimated values for the round trip time (estimatedRTT) and deviation in the RTT (DevRTT) are 250 msec and 38 msec, respectively (see Section 3.5.3 for a discussion of these variables). Suppose that the next three measured values of the RTT are 280 msec, 200 msec, and 340 msec respectively. <image 1> Compute TCP's new value of DevRTT, estimatedRTT, and the TCP timeout value after each of these three measured RTT values is obtained. Use the values of $\\alpha$ = 0.125, and $\\beta$ = 0.25. Round your answers to two decimal places after leading zeros. What is the estimatedRTT after the first RTT?",

    "description": "The image depicts a simplified model of internet communication between two computers. The diagram shows the layers of the network protocol stack for both computers, which include:\n\n1. Application layer\n2. Transport Control Protocol (TCP) layer\n3. Internet Protocol (IP) layer\n4. Link layer\n5. Physical layer\n\nA red arrow labeled \"RTT\" (Round Trip Time) connects the TCP layers of the two computers, indicating the time it takes for a packet to travel from one computer to the other and back. Below the protocol stacks, there are two computer icons representing the two computers involved in the communication. Between the computers, there is a blue shape labeled \"Internet,\" symbolizing the network infrastructure through which the data travels.\n\nThe diagram does not provide any numerical values or specific details about the RTT calculations mentioned in the question."
