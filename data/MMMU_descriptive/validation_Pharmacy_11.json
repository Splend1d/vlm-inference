    "description": "The image shows three different waves labeled (A), (B), and (C). Each wave represents an electromagnetic wave. Wave (A) has the largest peaks and troughs, indicating the highest amplitude. Wave (B) has smaller peaks and troughs than wave (A) but larger than wave (C). Wave (C) has the smallest peaks and troughs, indicating the lowest amplitude."
