    "description": "The image depicts a truss structure with various members labeled A, B, C, D, E, and F. The truss is subjected to external loads at points F and B. Specifically:\n\n- There is an 800 lb load acting vertically downward at point F.\n- There is a 400 lb load acting at an angle of 30 degrees from the horizontal at point B.\n- The truss has a symmetrical design with angles and distances marked:\n  - The distance between points A and B, B and C, C and D, D and E, and E and F is 6 feet each.\n  - The angle between members AB and BC is 45 degrees.\n  - The angle between members BC and CD is 60 degrees.\n\nThe truss is supported by rollers at points A and D, which allow for horizontal movement but not vertical movement. The question asks to determine the required cross-sectional area of member BC given the allowable normal stress (\u03c3_allow) of 24 ksi."
