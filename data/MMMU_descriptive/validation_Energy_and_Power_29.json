    "question": "The pump-turbine system in Fig. P3.135 draws water from the upper reservoir in the daytime to produce power for a city. At night, it pumps water from lower to upper reservoirs to restore the situation. For a design flow rate of 15,000 gal/min in either direction, the friction head loss is 17 ft. Estimate the power in kW extracted by the turbine. <image 1>",
    "options": "['540 hp', '334 hp', '410 hp']",

    "description": "The image depicts a pump-turbine system used for hydroelectric power generation. The system consists of two reservoirs at different elevations. The upper reservoir is labeled with a water temperature of 20\u00b0C and an elevation of Z\u2081 = 150 ft. The lower reservoir has an elevation of Z\u2082 = 25 ft. Water flows from the upper reservoir through a pipe to the pump-turbine, which then discharges the water into the lower reservoir.\n\nThe pump-turbine is shown in the middle of the diagram, indicating its dual functionality: it acts as a turbine during the day to generate power and as a pump at night to move water back to the upper reservoir. The friction head loss in the system is specified as 17 ft.\n\nThe question asks for the power extracted by the turbine when operating at a design flow rate of 15,000 gallons per minute (gal/min) in either direction. The options provided are:\nA. 540 hp\nB. 334 hp\nC. 410 hp"
