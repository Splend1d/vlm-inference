    "question": "<image 1>A circuit is connected as shown. All light bulbs are identical. When the switch in the circuit is closed illuminating bulb #4, which other bulb(s) also become brighter?",
    "options": "['Bulb #1 only', 'Bulb #2 only', 'Bulbs #2 and #3 only', 'Bulbs #1, #2, and #3']",

    "description": "The image depicts an electrical circuit with four light bulbs labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4. The circuit includes a battery represented by the symbol \u03b5. \n\n- Bulb 1 is connected directly to the positive terminal of the battery.\n- Bulb 2 is connected in series with bulb 1.\n- Bulb 3 is connected in parallel with bulb 2.\n- Bulb 4 is connected in parallel with bulb 3, but there is a switch (labeled S) in the path leading to bulb 4.\n\nWhen the switch S is closed, it allows current to flow through bulb 4. This configuration suggests that closing the switch will affect the current distribution in the circuit."
