    "question": "Among the following binary trees, which one may become a binary search decision tree (excluding external nodes)",
    "options": "['<image 1>', '<image 2>', '<image 3>', '<image 4>']",
    "id": "validation_Computer_Science_11",
    "description": "The images depict four different binary trees, each with a varying number of nodes and connections. Here is a detailed description of each tree:\n\n**Image 1:**\n- This tree has a total of 7 nodes.\n- The root node has two children.\n- The left child of the root has three children.\n- The right child of the root has no children.\n- The leftmost child of the left child of the root has two children.\n- The rightmost child of the left child of the root has no children.\n- The middle child of the left child of the root has no children.\n\n**Image 2:**\n- This tree has a total of 7 nodes.\n- The root node has two children.\n- The left child of the root has three children.\n- The right child of the root has three children.\n- The leftmost child of the left child of the root has no children.\n- The middle child of the left child of the root has no children.\n- The rightmost child of the left child of the root has no children.\n- The leftmost child of the right child of the root has no children.\n- The middle child of the right child of the root has no children.\n- The rightmost child of the right child of the root has no children.\n\n**Image 3:**\n- This tree has a total of 8 nodes.\n- The root node has two children.\n- The left child of the root has three children.\n- The right child of the root has three children.\n- The leftmost child of the left child of the root has no children.\n- The middle child of the left child of the root has no children.\n- The rightmost child of the left child of the root has no children.\n- The leftmost child of the right child of the root has no children.\n- The middle child of the right child of the root has no children.\n- The rightmost child of the right child of the root has no children.\n- There is an additional node connected to the rightmost child of the right child of the root.\n\n**Image 4:**\n- This tree has a total of 9 nodes.\n- The root node has two children.\n- The left child of the root has three children.\n- The right child of the root has three children.\n- The leftmost child of the left child of the root has no children.\n- The middle child of the left child of the root has no children.\n- The rightmost child of the left child of the root has no children.\n- The leftmost child of the right child of the root has no children.\n- The middle child of the right child of the root has no children.\n- The rightmost child of the right child of the root has no children.\n- There are two additional nodes connected to the rightmost child of the right child of the root.\n\nBased on these descriptions, the correct answer to the question is **Image 2**, as it represents a binary search decision tree (excluding external nodes)."
