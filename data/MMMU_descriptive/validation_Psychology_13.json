    "question": "<image 1> In the figure above, where does the neurotransmitter dopamine have its effect?",
    "options": "['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E']",
    "id": "validation_Psychology_13",
    "description": "The image depicts a synapse between two neurons. The presynaptic neuron is labeled \"Presynaptic Neuron\" and the postsynaptic neuron is labeled \"Postsynaptic Neuron.\" The diagram includes several key components:\n\n- **A**: This is the axon terminal of the presynaptic neuron.\n- **B**: These are vesicles within the presynaptic neuron, which contain neurotransmitters.\n- **C**: These are receptors on the postsynaptic neuron.\n- **D**: This represents the synaptic cleft, the gap between the presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons.\n- **E**: These are the neurotransmitter molecules (dopamine in this case) released from the presynaptic neuron into the synaptic cleft.\n\nThe neurotransmitter dopamine has its effect at the receptors on the postsynaptic neuron, which are labeled as **C** in the image. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is:\n\nC. C"
