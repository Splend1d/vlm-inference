    "description": "The image depicts a schematic of a jet engine combustion chamber with various labeled components and parameters. Here are the details:\n\n1. **Combustion Chamber**: The central part of the image represents the combustion chamber.\n2. **Air Inlet (1)**: At the left side of the combustion chamber, there is an inlet labeled \"1\" where air enters. The parameters given for this inlet are:\n   - Temperature: 20\u00b0C\n   - Pressure: 1 atm\n   - Area (A_1): 0.5 m\u00b2\n   - Velocity (V_1): 250 m/s\n3. **Fuel Inlet**: There is a separate inlet for fuel labeled \"m_fuel\". The fuel-air ratio is specified as 1:30.\n4. **Air Outlet (2)**: At the right side of the combustion chamber, there is an outlet labeled \"2\" where the air exits. The parameters given for this outlet are:\n   - Pressure: 1 atm\n   - Velocity (V_2): 900 m/s\n   - Area (A_2): 0.4 m\u00b2\n5. **Test Stand Support Reaction (R_x)**: There is a force labeled \"R_x\" acting downward on the combustion chamber, representing the test stand support reaction needed to balance the forces.\n\nThe question asks to compute the test stand support reaction \\( R_x \\) needed based on the given parameters."
