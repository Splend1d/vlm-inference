    "question": "A maternal and child health facility wanted to evaluate the effectiveness of two methods of screening for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN I-III), electronic colposcopy and cervical liquid-based cytology (TCT). 600 gynaecological outpatient cases were examined by both methods, and all cases were confirmed with cervical histopathology (the gold standard) at the same time. The results of all examinations were summarised in the table.<image 1> The specificity of electronic colposcopy was",

    "description": "The image is a table that summarizes the results of two screening methods for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN I-III): electronic colposcopy and cervical liquid-based cytology (TCT). The table is divided into four main columns: \"Test results,\" \"Patients with cervical lesions,\" and \"Patients with non-cervical lesions.\" Each column has further sub-columns for the test results of electronic colposcopy and TCT.\n\nHere is the detailed breakdown of the table:\n\n1. **Test results**:\n   - Electronic colposcopy: + or -\n   - TCT: + or -\n\n2. **Patients with cervical lesions**:\n   - Electronic colposcopy +, TCT - : 15 patients\n   - Electronic colposcopy -, TCT + : 5 patients\n   - Electronic colposcopy +, TCT + : 70 patients\n   - Electronic colposcopy -, TCT - : 10 patients\n   - Total: 100 patients\n\n3. **Patients with non-cervical lesions**:\n   - Electronic colposcopy +, TCT - : 10 patients\n   - Electronic colposcopy -, TCT + : 220 patients\n   - Electronic colposcopy +, TCT + : 25 patients\n   - Electronic colposcopy -, TCT - : 245 patients\n   - Total: 500 patients\n\nThe table provides a comprehensive summary of the outcomes of the two screening methods across different combinations of positive (+) and negative (-) results for both cervical and non-cervical lesions."
