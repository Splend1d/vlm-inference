    "question": "<image 1>A thin film with index of refraction n_1 separates two materials, each of which has an index of refraction less than nf. A monochromatic beam of light is incident normally on the film, as shown above. If the light has wavelength $\\lambda $ within the film, maximum constructive interference between the incident beam and the reflected beam occurs for which of the following film thicknesses?",

    "description": "The image depicts a diagram illustrating the interaction of light with a thin film. The diagram shows a monochromatic beam of light incident normally (perpendicular) onto a thin film. The thin film is sandwiched between two materials, each with an index of refraction less than \\( n_f \\), where \\( n_f \\) is the index of refraction of the film itself. The indices of refraction of the surrounding materials are labeled as \\( n_1 \\) and \\( n_2 \\), with both being less than \\( n_f \\). The light beam is shown entering from the top and interacting with the thin film at the interface."
