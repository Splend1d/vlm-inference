    "question": "Which arrow in <image 1> points to a large ribosomal unit?",
    "options": "['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'H', 'I']",
    "id": "validation_Biology_7",
    "description": "The image depicts a schematic representation of a ribosome during translation, a process in which messenger RNA (mRNA) is translated into a protein. The ribosome consists of two subunits: a large subunit and a small subunit. \n\n- The large ribosomal subunit is represented by a larger, oval-shaped structure with several components labeled.\n- The small ribosomal subunit is shown as a smaller, circular structure with mRNA bound to it.\n- The mRNA strand runs horizontally across the image from left to right, with the 5' end on the left and the 3' end on the right.\n- There are several labeled components within and around the ribosome:\n  - **A**: Points to a chain of amino acids (N).\n  - **B**: Points to a part of the large ribosomal subunit.\n  - **C**: Points to another part of the large ribosomal subunit.\n  - **D**: Points to a tRNA molecule bound to the ribosome.\n  - **E**: Points to another tRNA molecule.\n  - **F**: Points to a third tRNA molecule.\n  - **G**: Points to the small ribosomal subunit.\n  - **H**: Points to a part of the small ribosomal subunit.\n  - **I**: Points to a part of the large ribosomal subunit.\n\nBased on this description, the arrow labeled **B** points to a large ribosomal unit. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. B"
