A force F is applied at the other end, at an angle $\\theta $ to the rod. If F were to be applied perpendicular to the rod, at what distance from the axis should it be applied in order to produce the same torque?<image 1>",

    "description": "The image shows a rod on a horizontal tabletop that is pivoted at one end and is free to rotate without friction about a vertical axis. The rod has a length \\( L \\). At the other end of the rod, a force \\( F \\) is applied at an angle \\( \\theta \\) to the rod. The force \\( F \\) is directed towards the right and slightly upwards, forming an angle \\( \\theta \\) with the rod. The view is from above, showing the top surface of the rod and the direction of the force."
