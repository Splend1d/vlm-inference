    "description": "The image is a graph showing the velocity of a duck flying due south over time. The x-axis represents time, and the y-axis represents velocity. The graph has several key points labeled A, B, C, and D.\n\n- Point A shows an increase in velocity.\n- Point B shows the highest velocity reached by the duck.\n- Point C shows a decrease in velocity but still positive.\n- Point D shows the velocity dropping to zero.\n\nBased on this description, the question asks at which point the duck stopped its forward motion. The correct answer is:\n\nD. D"
