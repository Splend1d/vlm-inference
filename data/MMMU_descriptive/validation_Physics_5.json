    "description": "The image depicts a uniformly accelerating ball with its positions marked at different time intervals. The time intervals are labeled from 0 seconds to 5 seconds, and the corresponding positions of the ball are indicated in centimeters. Here are the details:\n\n- At 0 seconds, the ball is at the 0 cm mark.\n- At 1 second, the ball is at the 1 cm mark.\n- At 2 seconds, the ball is at the 4 cm mark.\n- At 3 seconds, the ball is at the 9 cm mark.\n- At 4 seconds, the ball is at the 16 cm mark.\n- At 5 seconds, the ball is at the 25 cm mark.\n\nThe positions of the ball increase in a quadratic manner, indicating uniform acceleration."
