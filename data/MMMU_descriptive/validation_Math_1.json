    "description": "The image is a graph with an \\(x\\)-axis and a \\(y\\)-axis, labeled as \"Fig. 6-1.\" The graph shows a step function, which is a piecewise constant function. The function appears to be the greatest integer function, denoted as \\([x]\\), which returns the greatest integer less than or equal to \\(x\\).\n\nKey observations from the graph:\n- The function has horizontal segments at integer values of \\(y\\).\n- Each segment starts at an open circle (indicating the value is not included) and ends at a closed circle (indicating the value is included).\n- For example, the segment at \\(y = 1\\) starts just before \\(x = 1\\) and ends at \\(x = 2\\).\n- The segment at \\(y = 2\\) starts just before \\(x = 2\\) and ends at \\(x = 3\\).\n\nBased on these observations, the limit of the function as \\(x\\) approaches 2 from the left is 1, because the function value is 1 for all \\(x\\) values slightly less than 2. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is:\n\nA. 1"
