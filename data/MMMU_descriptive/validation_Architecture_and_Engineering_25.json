    "question": "A road is being proposed to facilitate a housing development on a scenic lake. Two alternatives have been suggested. One of the roadway alignments is to go around the lake  and slightly impact a wetland. The second alternative will also go around the lake and  will significantly impact two wetlands. The following table shows the anticipated costs  for each alternative. Assuming that the annual interestrate is 7 percent, determine which alternative is preferred using equivalent annual cost analysis.<image 1>",
    "options": "['EUAW1=$18,444, EUAW2=$19,730', 'EUAW1=$18,444, EUAW2=$15,730', 'EUAW1=$15,444, EUAW2=$19,730']",

    "description": "The image is a table comparing two alternatives for a roadway alignment around a lake, with one option impacting a wetland and the other significantly impacting two wetlands. The table lists various cost factors for each alternative:\n\n- **Alternative I:**\n  - First Cost: $75,000\n  - Annual Maintenance Cost: $3,000\n  - Service Life (years): 15\n  - Salvage Value: $45,000\n  - Annual Wetland Costs: $7,500\n  - Annual Lighting Costs: $1,500\n\n- **Alternative II:**\n  - First Cost: $125,000\n  - Annual Maintenance Cost: $2,000\n  - Service Life (years): 15\n  - Salvage Value: $25,000\n  - Annual Wetland Costs: $2,500\n  - Annual Lighting Costs: $2,500\n\nThe table provides the necessary data to perform an equivalent annual cost analysis for both alternatives, considering an annual interest rate of 7 percent."
