The table has five columns: Instrument station, Staff station, Bearing, Vertical angle, and Staff readings (m). Here are the details:\n\n- **Instrument station**: R\n- **Staff station**:\n  - P\n  - Q\n- **Bearing**:\n  - For P: 130\u00b0\n  - For Q: 220\u00b0\n- **Vertical angle**:\n  - For P: +10\u00b032'\n  - For Q: +5\u00b006'\n- **Staff readings (m)**:\n  - For P: 1.255, 1.810, 2.365\n  - For Q: 1.300, 2.120, 2.940\n\nThe constants of the instrument were 100 and 0, and the staff was held vertical."
