    "description": "The image depicts the chemical structure of the amino acid isoleucine. The structure shows a central carbon atom (C) bonded to four different groups: a carboxylate group (COO\u207b), an ammonium group (NH\u2083\u207a), a hydrogen atom (H), and a side chain consisting of two methyl groups (CH\u2083) and one methylene group (CH\u2082). The side chain is branched, with one methyl group attached directly to the central carbon and the other methyl group attached to the methylene group. This branching creates a chiral center at the central carbon atom, which is characteristic of most amino acids."
