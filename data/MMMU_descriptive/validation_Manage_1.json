    "description": "The image depicts a conceptual model of bi-sociation, as proposed by Arthur Koestler in 1964. The illustration shows a human head split into two halves, with various symbols and elements inside and outside the head. \n\nInside the left half of the head, there is a light bulb, which typically represents ideas or insights. Inside the right half of the head, there is a chair and a fan, symbolizing unrelated concepts. Outside the head, to the left, there is a person sitting on a cushion, possibly representing relaxation or contemplation.\n\nArrows connect the light bulb to the chair and the fan, indicating the process of associating unrelated concepts. A lightning bolt symbolizes the moment of insight or creative breakthrough when these associations occur.\n\nBased on this description, the concept of dual association suggested by Berk (2013) involves:\n\nB. List the attributes of each unrelated concept independently\nC. Evaluate different combinations of properties of two unrelated concepts\nD. Look for areas that force fit these attributes and provide opportunities\n\nOption A, \"Defining the criteria for creativity,\" is not directly related to the concept of dual association as depicted in the image."
