    "description": "The image depicts a triangular plate with a right-angled triangle shape. The triangle has two legs of equal length, each measuring 800 mm, forming a 45-degree angle with the vertical axis (y-axis). The hypotenuse of the triangle is inclined at a 45-degree angle to both the x-axis and y-axis. The plate is fixed at its base along the y-axis. At the apex of the triangle, labeled as point A, there is a horizontal displacement of 5 mm, indicated by an arrow pointing to the right from point A to point A'. The displacement is perpendicular to the original position of point A, which lies on the line x'x. The overall orientation of the triangle suggests that it is subjected to a deformation in the horizontal direction, causing the apex to move horizontally while the base remains fixed."
