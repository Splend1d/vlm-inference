    "description": "The image depicts an electrical circuit consisting of two coupled inductors. The inductors are labeled \\( L_1 \\) and \\( L_2 \\), with values of 10 henries (H) each. There is a mutual inductance \\( M \\) between them, which is given as 9 henries (H). The currents flowing through the inductors are denoted as \\( i_1 \\) and \\( i_2 \\), with \\( i_1 = 10 \\sin t \\) and \\( i_2 = 0 \\).\n\nThe voltage across \\( L_1 \\) is labeled \\( v_1 \\), and the voltage across \\( L_2 \\) is labeled \\( v_2 \\). The circuit diagram shows the direction of the currents and the polarity of the voltages.\n\nTo calculate the voltage \\( v_2 \\), we need to use the concept of mutual inductance. The voltage induced in \\( L_2 \\) due to the current in \\( L_1 \\) can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ v_2 = -M \\frac{di_1}{dt} \\]\n\nGiven:\n- \\( M = 9 \\) H\n- \\( i_1 = 10 \\sin t \\)\n\nFirst, find the derivative of \\( i_1 \\) with respect to time \\( t \\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{di_1}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}(10 \\sin t) = 10 \\cos t \\]\n\nNow, substitute this into the formula for \\( v_2 \\):\n\n\\[ v_2 = -M \\frac{di_1}{dt} = -9 \\times 10 \\cos t = -90 \\cos t \\]\n\nTherefore, the voltage \\( v_2 \\) is:\n\n\\[ v_2 = -90 \\cos t \\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nA. -90 cos(t) V"
