They have recently received the result of a market survey that indicates that they can increase the retail price of their product by 10% without losing customers or market share. All other costs will remain unchanged. If they enact the 10% price increase, what will be their new break-even point in units and dollars? Their most recent CVP analysis is: <image 1> ",
    "options": "['350 units and $34,647.65', '355 units and $35,647.65', '350 units and $35,647.65', '355 units and $34,647.65']",

    "description": "The image shows a financial analysis for Baghdad Company, which produces a single product. The analysis includes the following details:\n\n- **Units sold**: 1,450\n- **Sales price per unit**: $90\n- **Variable cost per unit**: $40\n- **Contribution margin per unit**: $50 (calculated as Sales price per unit - Variable cost per unit)\n- **Fixed costs**: $20,650\n- **Break-even (in units)**: 413 (calculated as Fixed costs / Contribution margin per unit)\n- **Break-even (in dollars)**: $37,170 (calculated as Break-even (in units) * Sales price per unit)\n\nAdditionally, there is a breakdown of sales and costs:\n- **Sales**: $130,500 (calculated as Units sold * Sales price per unit)\n- **Variable costs**: $58,000 (calculated as Units sold * Variable cost per unit)\n- **Contribution margin**: $72,500 (calculated as Sales - Variable costs)\n- **Net income (loss)**: $51,850 (calculated as Contribution margin - Fixed costs)\n\nBased on this information, if the company increases the retail price by 10%, the new sales price per unit would be $99 ($90 + 10% of $90). The variable cost per unit remains unchanged at $40. Therefore, the new contribution margin per unit would be $59 ($99 - $40).\n\nTo find the new break-even point in units, we use the formula:\n\\[ \\text{Break-even (in units)} = \\frac{\\text{Fixed costs}}{\\text{Contribution margin per unit}} \\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\\[ \\text{Break-even (in units)} = \\frac{20,650}{59} \\approx 350 \\text{ units} \\]\n\nTo find the new break-even point in dollars, we multiply the break-even units by the new sales price per unit:\n\\[ \\text{Break-even (in dollars)} = 350 \\times 99 = \\$34,650 \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nA. 350 units and $34,647.65"
