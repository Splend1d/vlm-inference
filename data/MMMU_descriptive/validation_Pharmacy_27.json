    "question": "The manufacture of compound F requires five separate chemical reactions. The initial reactant, compound A, is converted to compound B, compound B is converted to compound C, and so on. The diagram below summarizes the steps in the manufacture of compound F, including the percent yield for each step. Provide the missing quantities or missing percent yields.Assume that the reactant and product in each step react in a one-to-one mole ratio. <image 1>",

    "description": "The image depicts a flowchart representing the synthesis of compound F through a series of five chemical reactions. Each reaction step is shown with arrows pointing from the reactant to the product, along with the percent yield for each step. Here are the details:\n\n1. **Compound A to Compound B:**\n   - Initial reactant: 10.0 mol of Compound A.\n   - Percent yield: 40.0%.\n   - Resulting product: 4.00 mol of Compound B.\n\n2. **Compound B to Compound C:**\n   - Reactant: 4.00 mol of Compound B.\n   - Percent yield: Not specified.\n   - Resulting product: 2.00 mol of Compound C.\n\n3. **Compound C to Compound D:**\n   - Reactant: 2.00 mol of Compound C.\n   - Percent yield: 25.0%.\n   - Resulting product: An unspecified amount of Compound D.\n\n4. **Compound D to Compound E:**\n   - Reactant: An unspecified amount of Compound D.\n   - Percent yield: 10.0%.\n   - Resulting product: An unspecified amount of Compound E.\n\n5. **Compound E to Compound F:**\n   - Reactant: An unspecified amount of Compound E.\n   - Percent yield: Not specified.\n   - Resulting product: 0.0100 mol of Compound F.\n\nThe goal is to determine the missing quantities and percent yields for the reactions involving Compounds B to C, C to D, D to E, and E to F."
