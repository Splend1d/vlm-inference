    "description": "The image depicts a histological section of spinal cord tissue stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). The tissue shows a central canal that is abnormally enlarged and filled with fluid, which is characteristic of syringomyelia. The central canal appears to extend into the surrounding spinal cord tissue, creating a cavity. There are no signs of diastematomyelia, which would involve a split in the spinal cord. The image does not show features specific to hydromyelia or syringobulbia, which typically affect different regions of the spinal cord or brainstem. Therefore, the diagnosis is most consistent with syringomyelia."
