The caf\u00e9 is illuminated by warm yellow lights, creating a cozy atmosphere. The sky above is filled with swirling stars and a bright crescent moon, adding a sense of movement and energy to the scene. The buildings surrounding the caf\u00e9 are painted in shades of blue and yellow, with some architectural details visible. The overall style of the painting is characterized by bold, expressive brushstrokes and a vivid color palette, which is reminiscent of post-impressionist art."
