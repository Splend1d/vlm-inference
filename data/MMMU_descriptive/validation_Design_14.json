    "description": "The image depicts an iconographic painting featuring three central figures: a seated woman holding a child, flanked by two standing figures. The seated woman is dressed in dark robes and has a halo around her head, as does the child she holds. The standing figures also have halos and are depicted in elaborate, patterned garments. The background includes additional figures with halos, suggesting a religious or spiritual context. The overall style, including the use of gold leaf, intricate patterns, and the depiction of the figures, is characteristic of Byzantine art. The painting appears to be quite old, with visible signs of aging and wear."
