    "description": "The image depicts a religious scene with multiple figures. In the center, there is a woman dressed in dark clothing, possibly Mary, kneeling and praying. Surrounding her are several other figures, including angels and people in various poses of prayer and adoration. The setting appears to be outdoors, with a stone structure and trees in the background. The painting style is detailed and realistic, with a focus on light and shadow, suggesting it was created during the Northern Renaissance period. The artist's signature is visible in the bottom left corner of the image."
