    "description": "The image depicts a diagram illustrating the relative positions of the Sun, Earth, and a spacecraft labeled \"S.\" The Sun is shown on the left side of the image, emitting light and appearing as a bright, yellowish sphere with a central cross indicating its center. The Earth is depicted on the right side of the image, shown as a smaller blue sphere with a white cross indicating its center. Between the Sun and the Earth, there is a dashed line representing the path of the spacecraft \"S.\"\n\nA vertical dashed line extends from the spacecraft \"S\" to the Earth, and another horizontal dashed line extends from the spacecraft \"S\" to the Sun. The distance between the spacecraft \"S\" and the Earth is labeled as \\( h \\), and the distance between the Earth and the Sun is labeled as 200,000 km.\n\nThe background of the image is dark, representing space, with numerous small white dots scattered throughout, symbolizing stars or other celestial bodies."
