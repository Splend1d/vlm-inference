    "options": "['a', 'b', 'same of the two']",
    "id": "validation_Pharmacy_9",
    "description": "The image consists of two panels labeled (a) and (b), each depicting a similar scene but with different levels of order.\n\nIn panel (a), there is a glass jar placed upright on a small table. The jar is filled with colorful balls, which are neatly contained inside. The jar and its contents appear organized and orderly.\n\nIn panel (b), the same glass jar is shown lying on its side on the same table. Several balls from the jar have spilled out and are scattered around the table and the floor. The balls are no longer contained within the jar, creating a sense of disorder.\n\nBased on this description, the question asks which picture appears to have more order."
