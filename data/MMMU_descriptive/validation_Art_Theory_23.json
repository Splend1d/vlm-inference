    "description": "The image depicts a modern abstract sculpture made of metal. The sculpture consists of several geometric shapes, including cubes and rectangular blocks, arranged in an asymmetrical and dynamic composition. The metal has a weathered appearance, with a patina that suggests it has been exposed to the elements over time. The sculpture is mounted on a cylindrical pedestal, which is also made of metal and has a similar weathered finish. The overall style and construction of the sculpture suggest it is a piece of contemporary art, likely created in the latter half of the 20th century."
