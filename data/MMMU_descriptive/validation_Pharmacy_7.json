    "description": "The image consists of three graphs labeled (A), (B), and (C). Each graph is plotted on a grid with both x-axis and y-axis ranging from 0 to 5.\n\n- Graph (A) shows a straight line that starts at the origin (0,0) and increases linearly as it moves to the right. The line has a positive slope, indicating that as the x-value increases, the y-value also increases proportionally.\n- Graph (B) displays a horizontal line that remains constant at a y-value of 4 across the entire range of the x-axis. This indicates that the y-value does not change regardless of the x-value.\n- Graph (C) depicts a curve that starts high on the y-axis and decreases as it moves to the right. The curve is concave downward, showing that the rate of decrease in the y-value slows down as the x-value increases.\n\nBased on these descriptions, the graph with a constant slope is Graph (B), as it is a horizontal line indicating no change in the y-value regardless of the x-value."
