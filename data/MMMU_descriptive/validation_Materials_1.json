    "description": "The image depicts a cross-sectional view of an H-beam, which is a type of structural steel beam commonly used in construction. The dimensions provided in the image are as follows:\n\n- The overall height of the beam is 200 mm.\n- The width of the flanges (the horizontal parts at the top and bottom) is also 200 mm.\n- The thickness of the flanges is 20 mm.\n- The web (the vertical part connecting the flanges) has a thickness of 20 mm.\n\nThe shape factor for the cross section of the H-beam can be determined using these dimensions. The options given are:\nA. 1.17\nB. 1.57\nC. 0.87\n\nBased on the provided dimensions and typical calculations for H-beams, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 1.57"
