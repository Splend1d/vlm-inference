    "description": "The image consists of three graphs labeled 1), 2), and 3). Each graph plots the ratio of AUC (Area Under the Curve) to Dose on the y-axis against Dose on the x-axis.\n\n1) The first graph shows a curve that starts at a high value and gradually decreases as the dose increases. This indicates that the AUC/Dose ratio decreases with increasing dose.\n\n2) The second graph displays a straight horizontal line, indicating that the AUC/Dose ratio remains constant regardless of the dose.\n\n3) The third graph depicts an upward-sloping curve, suggesting that the AUC/Dose ratio increases with increasing dose.\n\nBased on these descriptions, the relevant optical representation for transdermal absorption by active transport would be:\n\nA. Graph 1"
