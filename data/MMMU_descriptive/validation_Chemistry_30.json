    "description": "The image shows a Lewis structure representing a compound formed between two elements, M and X, which are from the third period of the periodic table. The structure is enclosed in square brackets and has a superscript charge of +2 for M and -2 for X. The Lewis structure for M is represented by [M\u00b2\u207a], indicating that M has lost two electrons to achieve a positive charge of +2. The Lewis structure for X is represented by [:X:] with four lone pairs of electrons around it, indicating that X has gained two electrons to achieve a negative charge of -2. The overall charge of the compound is neutral, as indicated by the superscript charge of +2 for M and -2 for X."
