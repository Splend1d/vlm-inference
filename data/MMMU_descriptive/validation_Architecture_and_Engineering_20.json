    "description": "The image depicts a diagram labeled \"Fig. 11.13 Rate of approach calculation\" for an embankment with specific dimensions and slopes. The embankment has a road width of 20 meters and an existing ground slope of 1 in 10 (10%). The side slopes are 1 in 2 (50%), and the center height of the embankment is 10 meters.\n\nKey points in the diagram include:\n- Point A is at the top of the embankment.\n- Point B is directly below point A, indicating the road width of 20 meters.\n- Point C is at the base of the embankment on the right side.\n- Point D is directly below point C, indicating the center height of 10 meters.\n- Point E is at the base of the embankment on the left side.\n- Point F is directly below point E, indicating the ground level.\n\nThe diagram includes the following measurements:\n- The distance from point A to point B is 20 meters.\n- The distance from point C to point D is 10 meters.\n- The slope from point A to point C is 1 in 2.\n- The slope from point E to point F is 1 in 10.\n\nThe question asks to calculate the side widths ($w_1$ and $w_2$) and the cross-sectional area of the embankment based on these dimensions and slopes."
