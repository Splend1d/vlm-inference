    "question": "A shear spring is made from two blocks of rubber, each having a height h, width b, and thickness a. The blocks are bonded to three plates as shown. If the plates are rigid and the shear modulus of the rubber is G, determine the displacement of plate A if a vertical load P is applied to this plate. Assume that the displacement is small so that $\\delta $=a tan$\\gamma $ $\\approx $ a $\\gamma $. <image 1>",

    "description": "The image depicts a shear spring setup consisting of two rectangular rubber blocks, each with a height \\( h \\), width \\( b \\), and thickness \\( a \\). These blocks are bonded to three rigid plates. The middle plate, labeled as \"A,\" is subjected to a vertical load \\( P \\) which causes it to deflect downward by a distance \\( \\delta \\). The deflection \\( \\delta \\) is related to the angle of shear \\( \\gamma \\) through the approximation \\( \\delta = a \\tan(\\gamma) \\approx a \\gamma \\), assuming small displacements. The shear modulus of the rubber is denoted as \\( G \\).\n\nGiven this setup, the question asks to determine the displacement \\( \\delta \\) of plate A when a vertical load \\( P \\) is applied, using the provided formula and assumptions."
