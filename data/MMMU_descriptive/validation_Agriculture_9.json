    "description": "The image shows a close-up view of a grapevine leaf with visible signs of downy mildew infection. The leaf exhibits characteristic symptoms of downy mildew, including yellowish-green spots and patches on the upper surface. These spots are irregularly shaped and scattered across the leaf, indicating the presence of the disease. The leaf veins are prominently visible, and the overall texture of the leaf appears slightly distorted due to the infection. The background includes other leaves, some of which also show signs of discoloration and damage, suggesting a widespread infection in the plant."
