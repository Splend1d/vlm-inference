    "question": "<image 1>The accompanying sketch shows the schematic arrangement for measuring the thermal conductivity by the guarded hot plate method. Two similar 1 cm thick specimens receive heat from a 6.5 cm by 6.5 cm guard heater. When the power dissipation by the wattmeter was 15 W, the thermocouples inserted at the hot and cold surfaces indicated temperatures as 325 K and 300 K. What is the thermal conductivity of the test specimen material?",

    "description": "The image depicts a schematic arrangement for measuring the thermal conductivity using the guarded hot plate method. The diagram includes several key components:\n\n1. **Current Source**: This is represented by a symbol indicating a source of electrical current.\n2. **Guard Ring**: This is a rectangular component labeled \"Guard Ring\" located to the left side of the heater.\n3. **Heater**: A wavy line labeled \"Heater\" is situated in the center of the diagram, indicating the heating element.\n4. **Wattmeter (W)**: This is a rectangular component labeled \"W\" located to the right side of the heater, used to measure power dissipation.\n5. **Connections**: There are lines connecting the current source to the guard ring and the heater, and another line connecting the heater to the wattmeter.\n\nThe dimensions provided in the question are:\n- Two similar 1 cm thick specimens.\n- A 6.5 cm by 6.5 cm guard heater.\n- Power dissipation measured by the wattmeter is 15 W.\n- Temperatures at the hot and cold surfaces are 325 K and 300 K, respectively.\n\nBased on this information, the thermal conductivity of the test specimen material can be calculated."
