    "description": "The image depicts a standard American roulette table layout. The table has 38 numbered slots, including numbers 1 through 36, plus two additional slots labeled \"0\" and \"00.\" Each number is either red or black, except for the \"0\" and \"00\" slots, which are green. The numbers are arranged in three columns and twelve rows, with each column containing 12 numbers.\n\nThe table also includes various betting areas:\n- At the top, there are sections for betting on specific numbers (e.g., 1, 2, 3).\n- Below that, there are sections for betting on groups of numbers, such as \"1st Dozen\" (numbers 1-12), \"2nd Dozen\" (numbers 13-24), and \"3rd Dozen\" (numbers 25-36).\n- There are also sections for betting on odd or even numbers, and for betting on numbers 1-18 or 19-36.\n- Additionally, there are sections for betting on colors (red or black).\n\nThe question asks about the probability of winning a bet on three numbers in a line, such as 1-2-3. Since there are 38 possible outcomes (the ball landing on any of the 38 slots), and you are betting on 3 specific numbers, the probability of winning this type of bet is 3 out of 38, or 3/38. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 3/38"
