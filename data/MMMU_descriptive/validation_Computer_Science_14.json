    "description": "The image depicts a precedence graph with three transactions labeled \\( T_1 \\), \\( T_2 \\), and \\( T_3 \\). The graph shows the following relationships between the transactions:\n\n1. \\( T_1 \\) has a dependency on \\( T_2 \\) (indicated by an arrow from \\( T_2 \\) to \\( T_1 \\)).\n2. \\( T_2 \\) has a dependency on \\( T_3 \\) (indicated by an arrow from \\( T_3 \\) to \\( T_2 \\)).\n3. \\( T_3 \\) has a dependency on \\( T_1 \\) (indicated by an arrow from \\( T_1 \\) to \\( T_3 \\)).\n\nAdditionally, there are labels indicating the operations involved:\n- \\( T_1 \\) involves operation \\( Y \\).\n- \\( T_2 \\) involves operations \\( X \\) and \\( Z \\).\n- \\( T_3 \\) involves operations \\( Y \\) and \\( Z \\).\n\nThe graph forms a cycle, where each transaction depends on another, creating a circular dependency: \\( T_1 \\rightarrow T_2 \\rightarrow T_3 \\rightarrow T_1 \\)."
