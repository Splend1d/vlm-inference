    "description": "The image depicts the process of facilitated diffusion across a plasma membrane. The diagram shows a concentration gradient of sodium ions (Na\u207a) moving from the extracellular fluid into the cytoplasm. The plasma membrane is illustrated with phospholipid bilayers and integral proteins. Glucose molecules are shown being transported through these proteins from the extracellular fluid into the cytoplasm. The direction of glucose movement is indicated by arrows pointing from the extracellular fluid towards the cytoplasm. The concentration gradient for Na\u207a is represented by a vertical arrow with a positive charge at the top and a negative charge at the bottom, indicating the movement of Na\u207a ions down their concentration gradient."
