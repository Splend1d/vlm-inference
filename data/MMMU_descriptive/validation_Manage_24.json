    "description": "The image is a scatter plot titled \"3-Year and 5-Year Annualized Returns for 15 Mutual Funds.\" It compares the 5-year annualized return (on the y-axis) with the 3-year annualized return (on the x-axis) for 15 mutual funds. Each fund is represented by a diamond-shaped data point on the graph.\n\nThe x-axis ranges from 0 to 20%, representing the 3-year annualized return, while the y-axis ranges from 0 to 25%, representing the 5-year annualized return. There are two lines plotted on the graph: a solid line labeled \"y = x\" and a dashed line labeled \"y = 2x.\"\n\nThe solid line \"y = x\" represents the line of best fit, indicating where the 5-year return equals the 3-year return. Points lying exactly on this line indicate mutual funds whose 3-year and 5-year returns are equal.\n\nBased on the description, the number of funds that have equal 3-year and 5-year returns can be determined by counting the number of data points that lie exactly on the solid line \"y = x.\""
