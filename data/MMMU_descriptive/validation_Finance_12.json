    "description": "The image shows a table with data for three stocks labeled A, B, and C. The table has six columns: \\( P_0 \\), \\( Q_0 \\), \\( P_1 \\), \\( Q_1 \\), \\( P_2 \\), and \\( Q_2 \\). Each column represents different values for each stock at different time periods:\n\n- \\( P_0 \\): Price at time 0\n- \\( Q_0 \\): Shares outstanding at time 0\n- \\( P_1 \\): Price at time 1\n- \\( Q_1 \\): Shares outstanding at time 1\n- \\( P_2 \\): Price at time 2\n- \\( Q_2 \\): Shares outstanding at time 2\n\nThe rows for each stock are as follows:\n\n- **Stock A**:\n  - \\( P_0 = 90 \\)\n  - \\( Q_0 = 100 \\)\n  - \\( P_1 = 95 \\)\n  - \\( Q_1 = 100 \\)\n  - \\( P_2 = 95 \\)\n  - \\( Q_2 = 100 \\)\n\n- **Stock B**:\n  - \\( P_0 = 50 \\)\n  - \\( Q_0 = 200 \\)\n  - \\( P_1 = 45 \\)\n  - \\( Q_1 = 200 \\)\n  - \\( P_2 = 45 \\)\n  - \\( Q_2 = 200 \\)\n\n- **Stock C**:\n  - \\( P_0 = 100 \\)\n  - \\( Q_0 = 200 \\)\n  - \\( P_1 = 110 \\)\n  - \\( Q_1 = 200 \\)\n  - \\( P_2 = 55 \\)\n  - \\( Q_2 = 400 \\)\n\nStock C undergoes a two-for-one split in the last period, which affects its share count and price."
