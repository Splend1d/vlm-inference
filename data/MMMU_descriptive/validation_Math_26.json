    "description": "The image depicts a graph with two curves labeled \\( y = g(x) \\) and \\( y = f(x) \\), and a horizontal line labeled \\( y = b \\). The shaded region is bounded by these three lines and the vertical axis at \\( x = 0 \\) and \\( x = a \\).\n\n- The curve \\( y = g(x) \\) is concave down and intersects the \\( y \\)-axis at \\( y = b \\).\n- The curve \\( y = f(x) \\) is concave up and intersects the \\( y \\)-axis below the point where \\( y = g(x) \\) intersects.\n- The horizontal line \\( y = b \\) intersects both curves.\n- The shaded region is the area enclosed between the curves \\( y = g(x) \\) and \\( y = f(x) \\) from \\( x = 0 \\) to \\( x = a \\), and it is also bounded by the horizontal line \\( y = b \\).\n\nGiven this information, the area of the shaded region can be calculated using the integral that represents the difference between the upper and lower boundaries of the region. Since \\( y = g(x) \\) is above \\( y = f(x) \\) in the shaded region, the correct integral expression for the area is:\n\n\\[ \\int_{0}^{a} [g(x) - f(x)] dx \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. \\(\\int_{0}^{a} [g(x) - f(x)] dx\\)"
