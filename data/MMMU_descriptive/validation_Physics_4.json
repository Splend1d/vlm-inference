    "description": "The image depicts a light ray entering a block of plastic from air. The light ray follows a straight path and encounters an interface between air and plastic at point P. At this interface, the light ray changes direction, indicating refraction. The angle of incidence in air is given as 37 degrees, and the angle of refraction in the plastic is given as 53 degrees. The angles are measured with respect to the normal line drawn perpendicular to the interface at point P. The light ray continues its path within the plastic, traveling towards point Q."
