    "description": "The image depicts a diagram illustrating the process of data transmission through various layers of the IP (Internet Protocol) stack. The diagram includes the following layers:\n\n1. **Application Layer**: This is the topmost layer where applications interact with the network.\n2. **Transport Layer**: Below the Application Layer, this layer handles the end-to-end communication between applications.\n3. **Network Layer**: This layer is responsible for routing packets across different networks.\n4. **Link Layer**: Also known as the Data Link Layer, it deals with the transmission of data over a single link between two nodes.\n5. **Physical Layer**: The bottommost layer, which deals with the physical transmission of bits over the network medium.\n\nThe diagram shows a message being broken down into segments at the Transport Layer, then into datagrams at the Network Layer, and finally into frames at the Link Layer. These frames are transmitted over the physical medium to the destination, where the process is reversed, reassembling the original message.\n\nGiven this context, the layer in the IP stack that best corresponds to the phrase \"moves datagrams from the source host to the destination host\" is the **Network Layer**."
