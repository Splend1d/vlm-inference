    "question": "This tumor is: <image 1>",
    "options": "['more common in children than adults', 'may be intraventricular in children', 'is often associated with seizures', 'also has binucleate neurons']",
    "id": "validation_Diagnostics_and_Laboratory_Medicine_22",
    "description": "The image depicts a histological section of tissue under a microscope. The cells appear to have a characteristic rosette-like structure, which is indicative of certain types of tumors. These rosettes are formed by cells arranged around a central lumen or cavity. The cells have a somewhat uniform appearance, with round nuclei and a faintly stained cytoplasm. The overall staining pattern suggests the use of a hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain, which is commonly used in histology to differentiate between cell structures.\n\nBased on these observations, the tumor in the image is likely a medulloblastoma, which is a type of brain tumor. Medulloblastomas are known for their rosette-like structures and are more common in children than in adults. They can occur intraventricularly in children and are often associated with symptoms such as seizures. However, the presence of binucleate neurons is not a typical feature of medulloblastomas.\n\nTherefore, the correct answers are:\nA. more common in children than adults\nB. may be intraventricular in children\nC. is often associated with seizures"
