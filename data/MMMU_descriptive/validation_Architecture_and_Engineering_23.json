    "description": "The image shows a table with data related to a survey conducted from the bottom of a shaft at point A along an existing tunnel to the bottom of a shaft at point E. The table has four columns: \"Line,\" \"WCB\" (which includes degrees, minutes, and seconds), \"Measured distance (m),\" and \"Remarks.\"\n\nHere is the detailed breakdown of the table:\n\n- **Line AB:**\n  - WCB: 70\u00b0 30' 00\"\n  - Measured distance: 150.00 meters\n  - Remarks: Rising 1 in 10\n\n- **Line BC:**\n  - WCB: 0\u00b0 00' 00\"\n  - Measured distance: 200.50 meters\n  - Remarks: Level\n\n- **Line CD:**\n  - WCB: 154\u00b0 12' 00\"\n  - Measured distance: 250.00 meters\n  - Remarks: Level\n\n- **Line DE:**\n  - WCB: 90\u00b0 00' 00\"\n  - Measured distance: 400.56 meters\n  - Remarks: Falling 1 in 30\n\nThe table provides the angular measurements (WCB) and distances for each segment of the tunnel between points A and E. The remarks indicate whether the segment is rising, falling, or level."
