    "description": "The image is an entity-relationship (ER) diagram representing various entities and their relationships within an academic institution. The entities include COLLEGE, INSTRUCTOR, DEPT, STUDENT, COURSE, and SECTION. Each entity has attributes associated with it, and the relationships between entities are represented by diamonds with cardinality constraints.\n\n- **COLLEGE** has attributes like CName, CPhone, COffice, and is related to DEPT through the relationship \"HAS\" with cardinality (0,N).\n- **INSTRUCTOR** has attributes like Id, IName, IPhone, IOffice, and Rank, and is related to DEPT through the relationship \"EMPLOYS\" with cardinality (0,N).\n- **DEPT** has attributes like DName, DCode, DOffice, DPhone, and is related to COURSE through the relationship \"OFFERS\" with cardinality (1,1).\n- **STUDENT** has attributes like FName, LName, SName, MName, DOB, Addr, Phone, Major, and is related to SECTION through the relationship \"TAKES\" with cardinality (5,N).\n- **COURSE** has attributes like CCode, Credits, CoName, CDesc, Level, and is related to DEPT through the relationship \"OFFERS\" with cardinality (1,1).\n- **SECTION** has attributes like SecId, SecNo, DaysTime, Year, Sem, CRoom, Bldg, RoomNo, and is related to COURSE through the relationship \"SECS\" with cardinality (1,1).\n\nThe relationship \"OFFERS\" between DEPT and COURSE indicates that each COURSE must be offered by exactly one DEPT, and each DEPT can offer multiple courses. The cardinality constraint for this relationship is (1,1), meaning a COURSE can be offered by exactly one DEPT.\n\nBased on this description, the answer to the question is:\n\nB. 1"
