    "description": "The image depicts a mountainous landscape with a prominent snow-capped peak in the background. The slopes of the mountain are covered with patches of snow, indicating a cold climate. In the foreground, there is a vast expanse of flat, barren land with sparse vegetation. The overall appearance suggests a high-altitude or high-latitude environment where temperatures are low and plant life is limited. This type of landscape is characteristic of the tundra biome."
