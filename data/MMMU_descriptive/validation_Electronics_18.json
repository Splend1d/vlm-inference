    "description": "The image depicts an electrical circuit consisting of a voltage source \\( v_s(t) \\), a resistor with a resistance of 2 ohms (\u03a9), and an inductor with an inductance of 1 henry (H). The voltage across the resistor is denoted as \\( v(t) \\), and the current flowing through the circuit is denoted as \\( i(t) \\).\n\nThe voltage source \\( v_s(t) \\) is given by the function \\( 3t \\cdot u(t) \\), where \\( u(t) \\) is the unit step function. This indicates that the voltage source starts at time \\( t = 0 \\) and increases linearly with time.\n\nThe circuit is a simple series RLC circuit with no capacitors involved. The goal is to find the expression for the current \\( i(t) \\) in the circuit."
