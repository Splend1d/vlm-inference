    "question": "To spectrophotometrically determine the mass percent of cobalt in an ore containing cobalt and some inert materials, solutions with known [$Co^{2+}$] are prepared and the absorbance of each of the solutions is measured at the wavelength of optimum absorbance. The data are used to create a calibration plot, shown below. <image 1> A 0.630 g sample of the ore is completely dissolved in concentrated $HNO_3$(aq). The mixture is diluted with water to a final volume of 50.00 mL. Assume that all the cobalt in the ore sample is converted to $Co^{2+}$(aq). Calculate the number of moles of $Co^{2+}$(aq) in the 50.00 mL solution. Only write the result number, in the unit of 10^-4 mol.",

    "description": "The image shows a calibration plot for determining the concentration of $Co^{2+}$ ions using spectrophotometry. The x-axis represents the concentration of $Co^{2+}$ in molarity (M), ranging from 0 to 0.015 M. The y-axis represents the absorbance, ranging from 0 to 0.90. The plot consists of several data points that form a straight line, indicating a linear relationship between the concentration of $Co^{2+}$ and its absorbance. The data points are plotted at concentrations of approximately 0.0025 M, 0.005 M, 0.0075 M, 0.010 M, and 0.0125 M, with corresponding absorbance values of around 0.20, 0.30, 0.40, 0.50, and 0.60, respectively. The line passes through these points, showing a direct proportionality between concentration and absorbance."
