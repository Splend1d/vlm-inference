    "description": "The image depicts a flowchart with three interconnected blocks labeled \"1,\" \"2,\" and \"3.\" Each block has inputs and outputs represented by arrows pointing towards and away from the blocks. The inputs and outputs are labeled with variables \\( r_i \\) and \\( d_i \\) for \\( i = 1, 2, 3 \\), and there are intermediate variables \\( S_i \\) for \\( i = 1, 2, 3 \\).\n\n- Block 1:\n  - Input: \\( S_1 \\)\n  - Output: \\( \\tilde{S}_1 \\)\n  - Additional input: \\( d_1 \\)\n\n- Block 2:\n  - Input: \\( \\tilde{S}_1 \\)\n  - Output: \\( \\tilde{S}_2 \\)\n  - Additional input: \\( d_2 \\)\n\n- Block 3:\n  - Input: \\( \\tilde{S}_2 \\)\n  - Output: \\( \\tilde{S}_3 \\)\n  - Additional input: \\( d_3 \\)\n\nThe relationships between the variables are given in the question:\n\\[ S_{i-1} = 3S_i - d_i \\quad \\text{for} \\quad i = 1, 2, 3 \\]\n\\[ S_i \\geq d_i \\geq 0 \\]\n\nThe objective function to maximize is:\n\\[ 3\\sum_{i=1}^{3} r_i \\]\nwhere\n\\[ r_1 = 3d_1 \\]\n\\[ r_2 = 3d_2 \\]\n\\[ r_3 = 3d_3^2 \\]\n\nBased on these relationships and the flowchart, the optimal values for \\( d_i \\) can be determined."
