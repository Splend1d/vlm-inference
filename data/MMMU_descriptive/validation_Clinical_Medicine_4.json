    "description": "The image is an X-ray of the pelvis. The bones of the pelvis, including the ilium, ischium, and pubis, are clearly visible. The sacrum and coccyx are also evident in the upper part of the image. There is no apparent fracture of the femoral neck or dislocation of the sacroiliac joint. However, there is a distinct foreign body located in the midline at the level of the pubic symphysis. This foreign body appears to be a small, dense object that stands out against the surrounding tissues. There is no evidence of air in the bladder."
