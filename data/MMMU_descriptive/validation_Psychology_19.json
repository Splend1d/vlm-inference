    "question": "A researcher was interested in whether or not jazz vocals and opera influence men and women emotional states. She hypothesized that these types of music influence men and women differently. In a study investigating this hypothesis, 40 men and 40 women heard a jazz piece, and 40 men and 40 women heard an operatic piece. The jazz piece was sung by a man, and the operatic piece was sung by a woman. Afterward, participants rated themselves on an inventory measuring emotional state. Higher scores on the inventory indicate positive mood. Results of this study are represented in the graph below. <image 1> Which of the following is the most serious problem with the methodology of this research?",
    "options": "['Men and women did not listen to both types of music', 'The singers were not the same gender', 'The sample size was too small to draw a valid conclusion', 'The participants were not musicians']",

    "description": "The image is a bar graph titled \"Average Mood Inventory Scores of Men and Women by Music Type.\" The x-axis represents two categories of music: Jazz and Opera. The y-axis measures Mood Inventory Scores, ranging from 0 to 7. There are two sets of bars for each music type: one for men (light gray) and one for women (dark gray).\n\nFor Jazz:\n- The average Mood Inventory Score for men is approximately 6.\n- The average Mood Inventory Score for women is approximately 3.\n\nFor Opera:\n- The average Mood Inventory Score for men is approximately 3.\n- The average Mood Inventory Score for women is approximately 6.\n\nThe legend indicates that light gray bars represent men and dark gray bars represent women."
