    "description": "The image shows a scatter plot with two distinct clusters of points. One cluster is represented by blue dots, and the other cluster is represented by red triangles. The blue dots form a roughly circular shape, while the red triangles are scattered around the periphery of the blue cluster, forming an irregular boundary. The distribution suggests that a simple linear boundary would not adequately separate the two classes, as there are red triangles both inside and outside a potential linear boundary around the blue dots. A more complex curve, such as a quadratic or cubic curve, might be necessary to accurately separate the two classes."
