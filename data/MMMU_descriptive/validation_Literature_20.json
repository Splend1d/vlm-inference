    "description": "The image features a poem titled \"Dreams\" by Langston Hughes. The text is presented in a bold, orange font against a dark background. The poem reads:\n\n\"DREAMS\n\nHold onto dreams\nFor if dreams die\nLife is like a\nbroken-winged bird\nThat cannot fly\nHold fast to dreams\nFor when dreams go\nLife is a barren field\nFrozen with snow\"\n\nAt the bottom of the image, there is a hashtag: #dontgiveupworld. The overall design includes a subtle illustration of a bird in flight, which is integrated into the background."
