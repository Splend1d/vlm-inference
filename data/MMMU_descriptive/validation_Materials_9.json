    "description": "The image depicts a mechanical system consisting of a bell crank mechanism. The bell crank is connected to a vertical force \\( P \\) at point \\( A \\), which is given as \\( P = 1500 \\) N. The bell crank is supported by a pin at point \\( B \\), which is subjected to double shear. The dimensions provided are:\n\n- The distance from point \\( C \\) to point \\( D \\) is 300 mm.\n- The distance from point \\( B \\) to point \\( A \\) along the horizontal arm is 450 mm.\n- The angle between the two arms of the bell crank at point \\( B \\) is 45 degrees.\n- The diameter of the pin at point \\( B \\) is 6 mm.\n\nThe task is to determine the average shear stress developed in the 6-mm diameter pin \\( B \\) that is subjected to double shear."
