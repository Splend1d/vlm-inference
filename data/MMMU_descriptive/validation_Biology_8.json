    "question": "Reto Zach studied the whelk-eating behavior of the Northwestern crow. Below are two flight paths that the crow could assume when eating whelks: <image 1>. Select the flight path that would be used most often and the response that best supports your answer.",
    "options": "['Flight Path A: the crow has a wider view of his surroundings to assure that another bird will not steal the whelk', 'Flight Path A: the crow is maximizing the height to drop the whelk', 'Flight Path A: the crow is adding force to the downward movement to the whelk by flying higher', 'Flight Path B: the crow can see where the whelk lands', 'Flight Path B: the crow is throwing the whelk to the ground']",
    "id": "validation_Biology_8",
    "description": "The image depicts two flight paths labeled A and B for a bird, presumably a Northwestern crow, as it engages in whelk-eating behavior. \n\n- **Flight Path A**: The bird is shown flying straight down from a higher altitude, with its wings spread out. This path suggests a direct and vertical descent.\n- **Flight Path B**: The bird is shown flying in a more horizontal trajectory before dropping vertically. This path involves an initial horizontal flight followed by a sharp downward dive.\n\nBoth flight paths end at the same point on the ground, indicating the location where the whelk is dropped."
