    "description": "The image depicts an object being thrown upward into the air from an initial position that is 10 meters above the ground. The figure shows the initial position of the object and its position at a later time. The horizontal distance from the initial position at any time \\( t \\) seconds is given by \\( x(t) \\) meters, and the vertical distance from the ground at any time \\( t \\) seconds is given by \\( y(t) \\) meters. \n\nThe derivatives of these distances with respect to time are provided:\n- \\( \\frac{dx}{dt} = 1.4 \\)\n- \\( \\frac{dy}{dt} = 4.2 - 9.8t \\)\n\nThese derivatives represent the rates of change of the horizontal and vertical distances with respect to time. The question asks for the angle \\( \\theta \\), where \\( 0 < \\theta < \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\), between the path of the object and the ground at the instant the object hits the ground."
