Each line has corresponding values for \u0394N and \u0394E:\n\n- For line AB:\n  - \u0394N = -1190.0\n  - \u0394E = 0\n\n- For line BC:\n  - \u0394N = -565.3\n  - \u0394E = 736.4\n\n- For line CD:\n  - \u0394N = 590.5\n  - \u0394E = 796.8\n\n- For line DE:\n  - \u0394N = 606.9\n  - \u0394E = -468.0\n\n- For line EF:\n  - \u0394N = 1017.2\n  - \u0394E = 370.4\n\nThese values represent the changes in northing (\u0394N) and easting (\u0394E) for each line segment in the traverse ABCDEFG."
