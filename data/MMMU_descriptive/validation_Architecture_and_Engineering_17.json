    "description": "The image shows a table with two columns and nine rows. The first column is labeled \"Contour (m)\" and lists the contour levels in meters: 660, 665, 670, 675, 680, 685, 690, 695, and 670. The second column is labeled \"Area\" and lists the corresponding areas in square meters for each contour level: 5200, 9400, 16300, 22400, 40700, 61500, 112200, 198100, and 272400."
