    "question": "Suppose you have trained an SVM classifier with a Gaussian kernel, and it learned the following decision boundary on the training set:<image 1>You suspect that the SVM is underfitting your dataset. Should you try increasing or decreasing C? Increasing or decreasing $\\sigma^2$?",

    "description": "The image depicts a scatter plot of data points in a two-dimensional space, with one axis labeled from 0 to 1 and the other axis also labeled from 0 to 1. The data points are represented by two different symbols: yellow circles and black plus signs. There is a clear separation between the two clusters of data points, with the yellow circles primarily located in the lower left quadrant and the black plus signs primarily located in the upper right quadrant. A blue line, representing the decision boundary of an SVM classifier with a Gaussian kernel, is drawn across the plot, separating the two clusters of data points. The decision boundary appears to be linear and does not perfectly separate the two classes, suggesting that the SVM might be underfitting the data."
