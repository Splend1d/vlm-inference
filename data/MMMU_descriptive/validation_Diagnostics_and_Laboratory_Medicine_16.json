    "question": "This two-year-old boy was brought to CHP with 3-week history of occipital headaches. The mother tells you he sleeps with his neck extended. During the last week prior to presenting to CHP he vomited once/day. On neurologic exam there was no noticeable weakness, gait abnormality, balance or visual changes. The mass lesion is partially resected. Your diagnosis? <image 1> <image 2>",

    "description": "The images provided are MRI scans of a child's brain. \n\n- The first image (Image 1) is an axial view, showing a cross-sectional slice of the brain from above.\n- The second image (Image 2) is a sagittal view, showing a side profile of the brain.\n\nIn both images, there is a visible mass lesion located in the posterior fossa, near the cerebellum. The mass appears well-circumscribed and has a heterogeneous appearance, suggesting it might be a tumor. The surrounding brain tissue shows some compression due to the presence of the mass. There is also evidence of hydrocephalus, indicated by the enlarged ventricles, particularly noticeable in the sagittal view.\n\nGiven the location and appearance of the mass, along with the clinical symptoms described (occipital headaches, vomiting, and sleeping with the neck extended), the most likely diagnosis is:\n\nA. Pilocytic astrocytoma"
