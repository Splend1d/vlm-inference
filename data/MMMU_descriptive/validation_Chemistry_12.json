    "description": "The image presents a question about identifying the enantiomer of a given compound. The compound in question is represented by a structure with four substituents attached to a central carbon atom. The substituents are hydrogen (H), bromine (Br), methyl (Me), and ethyl (Et) groups. Additionally, there is an OH group attached to one of the substituents.\n\nBelow the main compound, there are four options labeled A, B, C, and D, each showing a different arrangement of these substituents around the central carbon atom. The task is to determine which of these options represents the enantiomer of the given compound.\n\nTo solve this, one would need to compare the spatial arrangement of the substituents in each option to the original compound and identify which one is a mirror image that cannot be superimposed on the original structure."
