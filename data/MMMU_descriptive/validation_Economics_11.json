    "description": "The image depicts a graph with two axes: the vertical axis represents cost in dollars ($), and the horizontal axis represents quantity (Q). The graph shows an average cost (AC) curve that is downward sloping, indicating that as the quantity produced increases, the average cost decreases. This suggests economies of scale, where larger production volumes lead to lower costs per unit.\n\nA dashed red line labeled \"Size of the market\" intersects the AC curve at a specific point on the quantity axis. This indicates that the size of the market is limited to a certain quantity level.\n\nGiven this information, the most probable reason for a monopoly existing in this market is:\n\nB. There are increasing returns to scale well beyond the size of the market."
