    "question": "A helical spring of stiffness k is cut into two halves and a mass m is connected to the two halves as shown in <image 1>. The natural time period of this system is found to be 0.5 s. If an identical spring is cut so that one part is one-fourth and the other part three-fourths of the original length, and the mass m is connected to the two parts as shown in <image 2>, what would be the natural period of the system?",

    "description": "The image shows a mechanical system consisting of a mass \\( m \\) connected to two springs. In the first configuration (Image 1), the spring is cut into two equal halves, each with a length of \\( \\frac{l}{2} \\). The mass \\( m \\) is attached between these two halves, and the entire setup is constrained by fixed walls at both ends.\n\nIn the second configuration (Image 2), an identical spring is cut into two unequal parts: one part is one-fourth of the original length (\\( \\frac{l}{4} \\)), and the other part is three-fourths of the original length (\\( \\frac{3l}{4} \\)). The mass \\( m \\) is again attached between these two parts, and the setup is similarly constrained by fixed walls at both ends.\n\nThe question asks for the natural period of the system in the second configuration, given that the natural period of the first configuration is 0.5 seconds."
