    "description": "The image shows the back view of a person wearing a dark-colored top with a peplum waistband and a bright pink belt. The sleeves of the top are loose and flowy, extending from the shoulder to just below the elbow. The fabric appears to gather slightly at the wrist, giving a soft, voluminous look. The background features lush green foliage and pink flowers, suggesting an outdoor setting."
