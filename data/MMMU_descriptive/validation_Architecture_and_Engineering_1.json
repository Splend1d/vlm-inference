    "question": "If the truss is to be designed for a  uniform live load of 0.32 kip/fit that can be  placed anywhere on the span in addition to a  concentrated live load of 24 kips that can be  positioned where it will produce the largest  force in bar CG, determine the maximum value  of live load force (tension, compression, or both)  created in bar CG. <image 1> ",

    "description": "The image depicts a truss structure with labeled points A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. The truss spans a total length of 90 feet, divided into six equal segments of 15 feet each. The height of the truss from the base at points A and F to the top at points B, C, D, and E is 20 feet. The truss is supported at points A and F, which are indicated by blue rectangular supports. The truss members are shown in light blue, and the joints are marked with black dots. The label \"P12.37\" is present at the bottom center of the image."
