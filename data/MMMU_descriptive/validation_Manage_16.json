    "question": "Email #1: E-mail from Marketing Manager to Research Staff: With ABC Oil currently the most profitable corporation in the country, followed closely by XYZ Oil, how valid is the image of the United States as dependent on foreign oil? What proportion of American energy needs can be met through domestic production? How do current production levels compare with previous years? What do we know about trends in demand? And if we must import, how much of that need can be answered by Canada? Positioning the company as an American energy company would be the most positive stance but only if we can support it by showing that our product comes from if not U.S. wells at least North American sources. E-mail #2: E-mail from Researcher #1 to Marketing Manager: Domestic production is healthy, but while it may be true that U.S.-based companies now produce more than the United States imports, we certainly don't produce as much as we consume, as you can see in the following graph. <image 1> E-mail #3: E-mail from Researcher #2 to Marketing Manager: ABC Oil's headquarters may be in Texas, but it sources crude from 21 countries, including both relatively stable nations like Kazakhstan and nations with periodic violent crises like Chad. XYZ Oil's practices are similar. We're a global society now, and an \"American\" company just means where the company pays taxes, not necessarily where it produces. The United States consumes more than 18 million barrels of crude per day, but our local fields produce less than half that. The difference has to come from fields somewhere else, no matter what company owns them. This isn't local farming where you eat what's grown close to home. We may be able to focus attention on our ties to American plants and American workers, but the product is an international mix. Consider the following statement. Does the information in the three sources support the inference as stated? Statement: The idea of \"American\" oil companies is archaic because major oil companies are now operating in global industries.",

    "description": "The image is a line graph titled \"U.S. Oil Production and Consumption.\" The x-axis represents the years from 1980 to 2010, and the y-axis represents millions of barrels per day. There are two lines on the graph:\n\n1. The top line, labeled \"Consumption,\" shows the consumption of oil in the United States over the years. The consumption starts around 17 million barrels per day in 1980 and gradually increases to approximately 19.18 million barrels per day by 2010.\n\n2. The bottom line, labeled \"Production,\" shows the production of oil in the United States over the years. The production starts around 9 million barrels per day in 1980 and gradually decreases to approximately 5.47 million barrels per day by 2010.\n\nThe graph clearly illustrates that the consumption of oil in the United States consistently exceeds its production, indicating a reliance on foreign oil to meet the demand."
