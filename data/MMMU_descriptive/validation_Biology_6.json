    "description": "The image depicts a phylogenetic tree with five organisms labeled 1 through 5. The tree branches out from a common ancestor at the bottom to individual organisms at the tips. The branching pattern is as follows:\n\n- Organism 1 branches off first.\n- Organism 2 branches off next.\n- Organism 3 branches off after organism 2.\n- Organism 4 branches off after organism 3.\n- Organism 5 branches off separately from the others.\n\nThe common ancestors are labeled A, B, C, and D, with each representing a point where the tree branches. \n\nTo determine the most recent common ancestor of organisms 1 and 3, we need to trace back from each organism to find the last point where their lineages converge."
