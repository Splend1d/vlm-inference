    "description": "The image shows a chemical structure of an organic molecule with four bromine (Br) atoms attached to a carbon chain. The molecule has a central carbon atom bonded to two other carbon atoms, each of which is also bonded to another carbon atom. The bromine atoms are attached to the second and third carbon atoms from the ends of the chain. The structure can be described as follows:\n\n- There are five carbon atoms in total.\n- The first and fifth carbon atoms are bonded to hydrogen atoms (not shown).\n- The second and fourth carbon atoms each have one bromine atom attached.\n- The third carbon atom has two bromine atoms attached.\n\nThis structure represents a compound with multiple chiral centers, specifically at the second, third, and fourth carbon atoms. Each chiral center can exist in two different configurations (R or S), leading to a total number of stereoisomers that can be calculated by considering the permutations of these configurations."
