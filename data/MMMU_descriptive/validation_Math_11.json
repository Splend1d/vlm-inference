    "description": "The image shows a graph of a quadratic function \\( f(x) = x^2 - 6x + 4 \\). The graph is a parabola that opens upwards, indicating that it is convex. The vertex of the parabola is at the lowest point, and the curve increases as it moves away from the vertex in both directions."
