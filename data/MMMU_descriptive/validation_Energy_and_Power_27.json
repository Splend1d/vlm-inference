    "description": "The image depicts a cylindrical container with a valve at the top. The valve has a cross-sectional area labeled \\( A_{\\text{valve}} \\). Inside the cylinder, there is a pressure labeled \\( P_{\\text{cyl}} \\), and outside the cylinder, there is a pressure labeled \\( P_{\\text{outside}} \\). The valve is shown in a closed position, and there is a force required to open it. The pressures inside and outside the cylinder are given as 735 kPa and 99 kPa, respectively. The cross-sectional area of the valve is given as 11 cm\u00b2."
