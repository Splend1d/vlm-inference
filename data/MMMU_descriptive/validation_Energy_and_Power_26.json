    "description": "The image depicts a diagram related to a fluid dynamics problem involving a hose and a nozzle. The key elements in the image are:\n\n1. A hose with a diameter of 0.625 inches.\n2. A nozzle with a diameter of 0.375 inches.\n3. A distance of 125 feet from the nozzle exit to the garden.\n4. Labels indicating \"V?\" near the nozzle, suggesting a question about velocity.\n5. Labels indicating \"Pinside?\" near the hose, suggesting a question about the pressure inside the hose.\n\nThe diagram is used to determine the minimum gauge pressure required inside the hose to reach the garden, assuming no losses."
