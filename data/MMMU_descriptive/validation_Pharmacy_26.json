The dashed line divides the structure into three regions labeled A, B, and C in the figure. Which one of the three parts of this protein is comprised mostly of $\\alpha$-helical secondary structure?",

    "description": "The image depicts a protein structure with a dashed line dividing it into three distinct regions labeled A, B, and C. Region A is located on the left side of the dashed line and consists primarily of coiled structures, which are indicative of $\\alpha$-helices. Region B is situated at the top right corner and features a combination of coiled and flat ribbon-like structures, suggesting a mix of $\\alpha$-helices and $\\beta$-sheets. Region C is found at the bottom right and is predominantly composed of flat ribbon-like structures, characteristic of $\\beta$-sheets. Therefore, the region comprised mostly of $\\alpha$-helical secondary structure is Region A."
