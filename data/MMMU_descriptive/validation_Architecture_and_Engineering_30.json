    "description": "The image shows a geometric figure consisting of a rectangular section connected to a triangular section. The rectangular section has a length labeled as \\( b \\) and a height labeled as \\( a \\). Inside the rectangular section, there is a circular hole with a radius labeled as \\( r \\). The dimensions provided are:\n\n- \\( a = 50.30 \\pm 0.01 \\) meters\n- \\( b = 82.65 \\pm 0.03 \\) meters\n- \\( r = 9.50 \\pm 0.02 \\) meters\n\nThe measurements were taken with a 30 m tape standardized at 30\u00b0C, and the field temperature during the measurements was 50\u00b0C. The coefficient of linear expansion is given as \\( 1.15 \\times 10^{-5} \\) per \u00b0C.\n\nTo compute the area, error in the area, and the standard error of the area, we need to consider the dimensions and their uncertainties, as well as the effect of thermal expansion."
