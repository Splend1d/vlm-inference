    "question": "An excursion company is considering adding small boats to their fleet. The company has $200,000 to invest in this venture. At present there is an estimated maximum demand of 6,000 customers per season for these tours. The company does not wish to provide capacity in excess of the estimated maximum demand. The basic data are given below for the two types of available boats. The company will make an estimated seasonal profit of $4,000 for each boat of Type 1 and $7,000 for each boat of Type 2. How many boats of each type should the company use to maximize profit?

    "description": "The image is a graph representing a linear programming problem related to maximizing profit for an excursion company considering adding small boats to their fleet. The graph plots two variables, \\( x_1 \\) and \\( x_2 \\), which represent the number of boats of Type 1 and Type 2, respectively. The objective function is given by:\n\n\\[ f(x) = 4,000x_1 + 7,000x_2 \\]\n\nThis represents the total profit from the boats, where \\( x_1 \\) and \\( x_2 \\) are the number of boats of Type 1 and Type 2, respectively.\n\nThere are constraints represented by lines on the graph:\n1. \\( 25,000x_1 + 80,000x_2 \\leq 200,000 \\)\n   - This constraint represents the budget limit of $200,000.\n2. \\( 1,200x_1 + 2,000x_2 \\leq 6,000 \\)\n   - This constraint represents the maximum demand of 6,000 customers per season.\n\nThe feasible region is the area where all constraints are satisfied. The vertices of the feasible region are labeled with numbers in parentheses, such as (1), (2), etc.\n\nTo maximize profit, we need to find the point within the feasible region that maximizes the objective function \\( f(x) \\). The optimal solution occurs at one of the vertices of the feasible region.\n\nFrom the graph, the optimal solution appears to be at vertex (15), which corresponds to 4 boats of Type 1 and 1 boat of Type 2.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nA. 4 boats of Type 1 and 1 boat of Type 2"
