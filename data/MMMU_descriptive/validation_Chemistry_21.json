    "description": "The image shows the structural formula of the glycine cation (glycinium ion). The structure includes two carbon (C) atoms, one nitrogen (N) atom, and two oxygen (O) atoms. The leftmost carbon atom is bonded to three hydrogen (H) atoms and one nitrogen atom. The nitrogen atom is bonded to the leftmost carbon atom and has a positive charge indicated by a plus sign. The rightmost carbon atom is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to another oxygen atom with a hydrogen atom attached to it. The pKa values are indicated for the labile protons: the proton on the nitrogen atom has a pKa of 9.6, and the proton on the hydroxyl group has a pKa of 2.3."
