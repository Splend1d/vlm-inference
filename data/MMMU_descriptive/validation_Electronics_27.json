    "description": "The image depicts an electrical circuit diagram featuring a three-phase balanced system with a Y-connected load. The circuit includes three voltage sources labeled A, B, and C, connected in a delta configuration. Each phase of the voltage source is represented by a circle with a plus sign indicating the positive terminal. The neutral point (n) is connected to the center of the delta configuration.\n\nThe Y-connected load consists of three branches, each containing an inductor (L), a capacitor (C), and another inductor (L). The values of the components are given as follows:\n- Capacitance (C) = 5 \u03bcF\n- Inductance (L) = 0.56 H\n\nThe frequency (f) of the system is specified as 60 Hz. The voltage across phase A and neutral (V_an) is given as 390 Vrms at an angle of 30 degrees.\n\nThe circuit is designed to analyze the behavior of currents and voltages in a three-phase system with a specific load configuration. The phase of interest for the question is I_cC, which refers to the current flowing through the branch connecting phase C to the neutral point (N) in the Y-connected load."
