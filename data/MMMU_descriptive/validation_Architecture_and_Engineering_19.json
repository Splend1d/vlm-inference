    "question": "Load is applied to the three-hinged  trussed arch in Figure P12.40 through the upper  chord panel points by a floor beam and stringer  floor system. If the live load is  represented by a uniformly distributed load of  0.8 kip/ft of variable length and a concentrated  load of 20 kips, determine the maximum force in  bar CM produced by the live load. Consider both  tension and compression. Joint E acts as a hinge.<image 1>",

    "description": "The image depicts a three-hinged trussed arch structure labeled as \"P12.40.\" The truss consists of multiple panels connected by joints, with the main horizontal members labeled from A to H at the top and I at the bottom. The vertical dimensions are marked as follows: the height from the ground to the lowest point of the arch (joint I) is 36 feet, the height from the ground to the middle joint (K) is 16 feet, and the height from the ground to the top joint (H) is 4 feet. The horizontal span of the truss is divided into six panels, each measuring 24 feet, resulting in a total span of 144 feet.\n\nThe truss has additional diagonal and vertical members connecting the joints, forming a series of triangles for structural stability. The joints are labeled alphabetically from A to H at the top, with additional internal joints labeled J, K, L, M, and N. Joint E is specifically noted to act as a hinge.\n\nThe question provided indicates that the truss is subjected to a live load through the upper chord panel points by a floor beam and stringer floor system. The live load is represented by a uniformly distributed load of 0.8 kip per foot of variable length and a concentrated load of 20 kips. The task is to determine the maximum force in bar CM produced by the live load, considering both tension and compression."
