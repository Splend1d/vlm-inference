    "question": "A collimated beam containing two different frequencies of light travels through vacuum and is incident on a piece of glass. Which of the schematics below depicts the phenomenon of dispersion within the glass in a qualitative correct manner? Select (e) if none of the options are qualitatively correct.",
    "options": "['<image 1>', '<image 2>', '<image 3>', '<image 4>']",

    "description": "The image consists of four separate diagrams labeled A, B, C, and D, each depicting the behavior of light as it passes from a vacuum into borosilicate glass. Each diagram shows a collimated beam of light entering the glass at an angle \u03b1.\n\n- **Diagram A**: The beam contains red and green light. The red light refracts more than the green light as it enters the glass.\n- **Diagram B**: The beam contains red and blue light. The red light refracts less than the blue light as it enters the glass.\n- **Diagram C**: The beam contains red and green light. Both colors of light refract equally as they enter the glass.\n- **Diagram D**: The beam contains green and blue light. The green light refracts more than the blue light as it enters the glass.\n\nEach diagram illustrates the concept of dispersion, where different wavelengths of light refract at different angles when passing through a medium like glass."
