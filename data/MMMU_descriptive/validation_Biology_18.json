    "question": "The RB gene encodes the retinoblastoma protein (pRB). Note: As shown in <image 1>, the dephosphorylated pRB protein is active in G1 phase. pRB binds to the transcription factor E2F and prevents E2F mediated G1->S transition. The Cyclin D-Cdk4 complex produced during G1, phosphorylates and thereby inactivates pRB. This allows the cell to enter S phase. The p16 protein inhibits the Cyclin D-Cdk4 complex. In which process are the proteins encoded by the target genes of E2F most likely to function? ",

    "description": "The image depicts a simplified diagram of the cell cycle regulation at the G1/S checkpoint. Key components include:\n\n- **G1** and **S**: These represent the G1 and S phases of the cell cycle.\n- **p16**: This protein is shown inhibiting the Cyclin D-Cdk4 complex.\n- **Cyclin D-Cdk4**: This complex is depicted as being inhibited by p16 and also as phosphorylating pRB.\n- **pRB**: The retinoblastoma protein, which is shown being phosphorylated by the Cyclin D-Cdk4 complex.\n- **E2F**: This transcription factor is shown being inhibited by pRB when pRB is not phosphorylated.\n\nThe diagram illustrates the following interactions:\n- p16 inhibits the Cyclin D-Cdk4 complex.\n- The Cyclin D-Cdk4 complex phosphorylates pRB.\n- Phosphorylated pRB releases E2F.\n- E2F promotes the G1-S transition.\n\nBased on this information, the proteins encoded by the target genes of E2F are most likely involved in processes related to the G1-S transition, specifically DNA replication."
