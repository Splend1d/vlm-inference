Table 10.19 contains ten of the paired responses for husbands and wives. Conduct a hypothesis test to see if the mean difference in the husband's versus the wife's satisfaction level is negative (meaning that, within the partnership, the husband is happier than the wife).

    "description": "The image shows a table labeled \"Table 10.19\" with two columns: \"Wife's score\" and \"Husband's score.\" Each column lists scores ranging from 1 to 4. The scores are as follows:\n\n- Wife's score: 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 2, 1, 1, 2, 4\n- Husband's score: 2, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4\n\nThese scores represent the ratings given by husbands and wives regarding their satisfaction with the division of childcare responsibilities. The ratings range from 1 (strongly agree) to 5 (strongly disagree), but the scores listed are only between 1 and 4."
