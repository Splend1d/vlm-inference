    "description": "The image is a black-and-white political cartoon from 1933. It depicts two men engaged in a physical altercation. One man, labeled \"Strike-Breaking,\" is dressed in a suit and appears to be attacking the other man, who is labeled \"Union-Suiting.\" The man being attacked is wearing a union suit and is being choked by the \"Strike-Breaking\" man. In the background, there is another figure, possibly a government inspector or detective, who is looking through a magnifying glass but seems to be ignoring the altercation. The overall scene suggests a conflict between strike-breaking efforts and union activities, with the government inspector seemingly oblivious to the violence occurring."
