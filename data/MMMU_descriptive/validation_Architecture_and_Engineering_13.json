    "description": "The image depicts a pin-connected structure consisting of three members labeled AB, AC, and AD. The structure is supported by pins at points B, C, and D, which are horizontally aligned and spaced 4 meters apart. Member AB is inclined at an angle from point A to point B, member AC is vertical from point A to point C, and member AD is inclined at an angle from point A to point D. Point A is subjected to a downward force of 200 kN. The height from points B, C, and D to point A is 4 meters. The cross-sectional areas of the members are given as \\(A_{AB} = 1000 \\, \\text{mm}^2\\) and \\(A_{AC} = A_{AD} = 500 \\, \\text{mm}^2\\). The modulus of elasticity (E) is specified as 200 GPa."
