    "question": "Solid sodium borohydride (NaBH4) is being studied as a possible source of hydrogen fuel for hydrogen-powered vehicles. The borohydride reacts with water to produce hydrogen gas and sodium metaborate. Identify which atoms of the reactants are oxidized, which atoms are reduced,<image 1>",
    "options": "['H,O', 'H,Na', 'H,B', 'H,H']",

    "description": "The image shows a chemical equation representing the reaction between solid sodium borohydride (NaBH4) and water (H2O). The equation is:\n\n\\[ \\text{NaBH}_4(s) + 2\\text{H}_2\\text{O}(l) \\rightarrow 4\\text{H}_2(g) + \\text{NaBO}_2(aq) \\]\n\nThis equation indicates that solid sodium borohydride reacts with liquid water to produce hydrogen gas and aqueous sodium metaborate."
