    "question": "The Ships Ahoy Manufacturing Company, a producer of supplies for both commercial and leisure time fishermen, wants to check on the efficiency of the production of its deluxe net for tuna fishing. It has established standard costs for making one of these fishing nets as shown below: <image 1> The fixed overhead rate is based on normal monthly activity of 120,000 direct labor hours. Last month 19,500 nets were produced. There had been no initial inventories. The total costs of production were: <image 2> Find the variance of price.",

    "description": "The first image provides the standard costs for producing one Deluxe Fishing Net:\n\n- Direct materials: 15 pounds at $0.21 per pound, totaling $3.15.\n- Direct labor: 6 hours at $2.00 per hour, totaling $12.00.\n- Variable overhead cost: $1.20 per direct labor hour, totaling $7.20 (since there are 6 hours).\n- Fixed overhead cost: $0.85 per direct labor hour, totaling $5.10 (since there are 6 hours).\n\nThe total costs per net are $27.45.\n\nThe second image shows the actual costs for the production of the Deluxe Fishing Nets last month:\n\n- Materials used: 296,000 pounds at $0.22 per pound, totaling $65,120.\n- Direct labor: 120,000 hours, totaling $252,000.\n- Variable overhead: $141,000.\n- Fixed overhead: $103,500.\n\nThe total costs of production were $65,120 + $252,000 + $141,000 + $103,500 = $561,620.\n\nTo find the variance of price, we need to compare the actual costs with the standard costs. However, the question specifically asks for the variance of price, which typically refers to the difference between the actual price paid for materials and the standard price per unit of material. \n\nGiven:\n- Standard price per pound of material: $0.21\n- Actual price per pound of material: $0.22\n\nThe variance of price can be calculated as follows:\n\nVariance of price = (Actual price - Standard price) * Actual quantity used\nVariance of price = ($0.22 - $0.21) * 296,000 pounds\nVariance of price = $0.01 * 296,000 pounds\nVariance of price = $2,960\n\nTherefore, the variance of price is $2,960."
