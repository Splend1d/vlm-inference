    "question": "A pipe of radius R has a fully developed laminarflow of air at P0, T0 with a velocity profile of V = Vc[1 - (r/R)2], where Vc is the velocity on the center-line and r is the radius, as shown in <image 1>. Find the total mass flow rate and the average velocity, both as functions of Vc and R.",

    "description": "The image depicts a cross-sectional view of a cylindrical pipe with a radius \\( R \\). The pipe contains a fully developed laminar flow of air. The velocity profile within the pipe is given by the equation \\( V = V_c [1 - (r/R)^2] \\), where \\( V_c \\) is the velocity on the center-line and \\( r \\) is the radial distance from the center of the pipe. The velocity profile is illustrated with arrows showing the direction and relative magnitude of the velocity at different points across the pipe's diameter. The arrows are more concentrated near the center of the pipe, indicating higher velocities, and become less dense towards the edges, indicating lower velocities. The image also includes a label for the center-line velocity \\( V_c \\) and the radius \\( R \\) of the pipe."
