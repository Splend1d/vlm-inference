    "description": "The image is a political cartoon titled \"Forty-Millionaire Carnegie in his Great Double Role,\" published in The Saturday Globe on July 9, 1892. The cartoon depicts Andrew Carnegie in two contrasting roles. On one side, Carnegie is shown holding a notice that reads \"Wages Reduced 20 per cent,\" symbolizing his role as a ruthless employer who reduces wages. On the other side, Carnegie is depicted giving away money, specifically $5000, representing his philanthropic efforts. The cartoon highlights the duality of Carnegie's character, showing how he could simultaneously exploit workers while also engaging in charitable acts. The caption at the bottom of the cartoon reads: \"As the tight-fisted employer he reduces wages that he may play philanthropist and give away libraries, etc.\" This suggests that Carnegie's philanthropy was funded by the exploitation of his workers."
