    "question": "Which process will finish last in the resource-allocation graph in <image 1>?",

    "description": "The image depicts a resource-allocation graph with four resources (R1, R2, R3, and R4) and three processes (P1, P2, and P3). The graph shows the allocation and request relationships between the processes and resources.\n\n- Resource R1 is allocated to process P1.\n- Resource R2 has two instances, one allocated to process P1 and the other allocated to process P2.\n- Resource R3 is allocated to process P3.\n- Resource R4 has three instances, none of which are currently allocated to any process.\n\nThere are directed arrows indicating the flow of resources from one process to another or from a resource to a process. Specifically:\n- Process P1 requests resource R2.\n- Process P2 requests resource R3.\n- Process P3 requests resource R2.\n\nThis setup creates a circular wait condition, where each process is waiting for a resource held by another process. This is a classic example of a deadlock situation in operating systems, where no process can proceed because each is waiting for a resource held by another process in the cycle.\n\nBased on this description, the correct answer to the question is:\n\nD. There is a deadlock."
