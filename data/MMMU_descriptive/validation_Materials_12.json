    "question": "An acetal polymer block is fixed to the rigid plates at its top and bottom surfaces. If the top plate displaces 2 mm horizontally when it is subjected to a horizontal force P=2 kN, determine the shear modulus of the polymer. The width of the block is 100 mm. Assume that the polymer is linearly elastic and use small angle analysis. <image 1>",

    "description": "The image depicts an acetal polymer block that is fixed to rigid plates at its top and bottom surfaces. The dimensions of the block are given as 400 mm in length and 200 mm in height. A horizontal force \\( P \\) of 2 kN is applied to the top plate, causing it to displace 2 mm horizontally. The width of the block is specified as 100 mm. The task is to determine the shear modulus of the polymer, assuming it is linearly elastic and using small angle analysis."
