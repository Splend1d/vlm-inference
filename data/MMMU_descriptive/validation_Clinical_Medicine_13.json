    "question": "You are shown subtraction <image 1>, T2 weighted <image 2> and T1 weighted axial <image 3> images from a screening breast MRI. What is the etiology of the finding in the left breast?",

    "description": "The images provided are from a screening breast MRI, showing three different types of scans: subtraction, T2-weighted, and T1-weighted axial views.\n\n1. **Subtraction Image (Image 1)**:\n   - This image appears to highlight areas of contrast enhancement.\n   - There is a noticeable area of enhancement in the left breast, which could indicate a region of interest for further evaluation.\n\n2. **T2-Weighted Image (Image 2)**:\n   - This image shows the breast tissue with varying intensities.\n   - The left breast has an area that appears hyperintense (bright), suggesting the presence of fluid or edema.\n   - There is also a small, dark spot within this hyperintense area, which might represent a susceptibility artifact or another type of lesion.\n\n3. **T1-Weighted Axial Image (Image 3)**:\n   - This image provides a clear view of the breast tissue with different tissue contrasts.\n   - The left breast shows a hypointense (dark) area corresponding to the hyperintense region seen in the T2-weighted image.\n   - The dark spot observed in the T2-weighted image is also visible here, appearing as a small, dark circle.\n\nBased on these observations, the finding in the left breast is likely due to:\n\n**A. Susceptibility artifact**\n\nReasoning:\n- The dark spot seen in both the T2-weighted and T1-weighted images is characteristic of a susceptibility artifact, which can occur due to the presence of materials like metal or air that disrupt the magnetic field during MRI scanning."
