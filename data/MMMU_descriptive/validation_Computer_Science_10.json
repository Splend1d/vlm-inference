    "description": "The image shows an adjacency matrix for a weighted undirected graph. The matrix is represented in a tabular format with rows and columns labeled from 0 to 9. Each cell in the matrix represents the weight of the edge between two nodes. Here is the adjacency matrix:\n\n```\n   0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9\n0 [\u221e  3  1  15 1  \u221e  1  9  \u221e  \u221e]\n1 [3  \u221e  3  13 \u221e  \u221e  \u221e  8  \u221e  \u221e]\n2 [1  3  \u221e  \u221e  1  1  2  \u221e  \u221e  \u221e]\n3 [15 13 \u221e  \u221e  1  1  18 \u221e  \u221e  \u221e]\n4 [1  \u221e  1  1  \u221e  18 \u221e  \u221e  \u221e  \u221e]\n5 [\u221e  \u221e  1  1  18 \u221e  \u221e  \u221e  \u221e  \u221e]\n6 [1  \u221e  2  18 \u221e  \u221e  \u221e  2  \u221e  \u221e]\n7 [9  8  \u221e  \u221e  \u221e  \u221e  2  \u221e  2  \u221e]\n8 [\u221e  \u221e  \u221e  \u221e  \u221e  \u221e  \u221e  2  \u221e  2]\n9 [\u221e  \u221e  \u221e  \u221e  \u221e  \u221e  \u221e  \u221e  2  \u221e]\n```\n\nTo find the total weight of the minimum spanning tree (MST) of this graph, we need to select edges with the smallest weights such that all nodes are connected and there are no cycles. We can use Kruskal's algorithm or Prim's algorithm to find the MST. However, since we are only interested in the total weight, we can manually inspect the matrix to find the smallest weights and ensure they form a connected graph without cycles.\n\nBy examining the matrix, we can identify the following edges with their weights:\n- Edge between nodes 0 and 1: weight 3\n- Edge between nodes 0 and 2: weight 1\n- Edge between nodes 1 and 2: weight 3\n- Edge between nodes 2 and 4: weight 1\n- Edge between nodes 4 and 5: weight 1\n- Edge between nodes 5 and 6: weight 2\n- Edge between nodes 6 and 7: weight 2\n- Edge between nodes 7 and 8: weight 2\n- Edge between nodes 8 and 9: weight 2\n\nAdding these weights together gives us the total weight of the minimum spanning tree:\n3 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 17\n\nTherefore, the total weight of the minimum spanning tree is 17."
