    "options": "[\"It is a prokaryote because it doesn't have a nucleus\", 'It is a eukaryotic cell because it has a cell wall and a nucleus', 'It is eukaryotic because it does not a nucleus nor a cell membrane', 'It is prokaryote because it has a cell wall']",

    "description": "The image shows a microscopic view of plant cells. The cells are rectangular and arranged in a grid-like pattern. Each cell has a distinct cell wall, which appears as a thick, dark line surrounding the cell. Inside the cells, there are visible structures such as chloroplasts, which appear as small green dots. The overall structure and organization of the cells suggest that they are part of a plant tissue, likely from a leaf or stem.\n\nBased on this description, the correct answer to the question is:\n\nB. It is a eukaryotic cell because it has a cell wall and a nucleus."
