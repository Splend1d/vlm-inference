    "options": "['Doxorubicin', 'Dactinomycin', 'Mitoxantrone', 'Bleomycin']",
    "id": "validation_Pharmacy_17",
    "description": "The image depicts a chemical structure with several key features. At the top, there are two cyclic peptides labeled \"cyclic peptides.\" Each peptide consists of amino acids: N-Me-Gly (N-methylglycine), L-Val (L-valine), L-Pro (L-proline), and D-Val (D-valine). These peptides are connected to a central tricyclic system through amide bonds. The tricyclic system includes a benzene ring fused to two other rings, one of which has an amino group (NH2) and another has a carbonyl group (C=O). The structure also includes methyl (Me) groups attached to the tricyclic system.\n\nBased on this description, the structure is characteristic of dactinomycin, which is known for its cyclic peptides and tricyclic system. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Dactinomycin"
