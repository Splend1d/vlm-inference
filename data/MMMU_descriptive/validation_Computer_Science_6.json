    "description": "The image is a graph showing the relationship between the training set size (m) and the error for both the training set (J_train(\u03b8)) and the test set (J_test(\u03b8)). The x-axis represents the training set size (m), and the y-axis represents the error. \n\nAs the training set size increases, the error for both the training set and the test set decreases. However, the error for the test set remains consistently higher than the error for the training set across all values of m. This indicates that the model performs better on the training data than on the unseen test data, suggesting overfitting.\n\nBased on this description, the algorithm is suffering from high variance."
