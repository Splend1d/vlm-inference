    "description": "The image shows an electrical circuit diagram with a voltage source \\( v(t) \\) connected to a time-varying capacitor \\( C(t) \\). The voltage source is represented by \\( v(t) = 2 \\sin(\\omega t) \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is the angular frequency. The capacitor's capacitance is given by \\( C(t) = C_0 (1 + 0.5 \\sin t) \\), where \\( C_0 \\) is a constant. The current through the capacitor is denoted as \\( i(t) \\).\n\nThe circuit consists of:\n- A voltage source \\( v(t) \\) with a sinusoidal waveform.\n- A time-varying capacitor \\( C(t) \\) with a sinusoidal variation in its capacitance.\n\nThe goal is to find the expression for the current \\( i(t) \\) through the capacitor."
