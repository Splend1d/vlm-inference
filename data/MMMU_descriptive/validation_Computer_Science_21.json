    "description": "The image shows a 4x4 matrix with numbers from 1 to 16 arranged in a specific order. The numbers are connected by arrows indicating the direction of traversal. The traversal starts from the top left corner (1) and moves rightward to the end of the row (4), then down one row and leftward (8), then up one column and rightward (12), and so on, forming a spiral pattern. The output sequence of the numbers is: 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, 16, 15, 14, 13, 9, 5, 6, 7, 11, 10. This indicates that the traversal is done in a spiral manner, starting from the outermost layer and moving inward."
