    "description": "The image depicts a large spiral structure made of rocks or stones, situated in a vast, open landscape with sparse vegetation and rocky terrain. The spiral extends from the ground and loops upwards, creating a striking visual contrast against the flat surroundings. The overall scene has a monochromatic tone, giving it a timeless and somewhat mystical appearance. The spiral's design and placement suggest an artistic or symbolic intention, reminiscent of ancient earthworks or land art installations."
