    "question": "<image 1> People visiting video rental stores often rent more than one DVD at a time. The probability distribution for DVD rentals per customer at Video To Go is given Table 4.5. There is five-video limit per customer at this store, so nobody ever rents more than five DVDs. Find the probability that a customer rents three DVDs.",

    "description": "The image shows a table labeled \"Table 4.5\" with two columns. The first column is labeled \"x,\" and the second column is labeled \"P(x).\" The table lists the values of x from 0 to 5 along with their corresponding probabilities P(x). Here are the values:\n\n- For x = 0, P(x) = 0.03\n- For x = 1, P(x) = 0.50\n- For x = 2, P(x) = 0.24\n- For x = 3, P(x) is missing in the image.\n- For x = 4, P(x) = 0.07\n- For x = 5, P(x) = 0.04\n\nThe question asks for the probability that a customer rents three DVDs, which corresponds to finding the value of P(3) in the table."
