    "question": "<image 1> In Ayrshire cattle, the mahogany/red locus is an autosomal gene. In both sexes, mahogany homozygotes are mahogany colored, and red homozygotes are red. However, the mahogany/red heterozygote is mahogany if male and red if female. Here is a pedigree for an Ayrshire family that is of great interest to Farmer MacDonald. (In the pedigree, open circles and squares indicate the mahogany phenotype; filled indicate red.) Although Elmer has long ago become a huge pile of Big Macs, Farmer MacDonald has frozen a good supply of Elmer's semen and has used it to artificially inseminate Elmira. What is the probability that Elmira will produce a mahogany female calf?",

    "description": "The image is a pedigree chart representing the genetic inheritance pattern of the mahogany/red locus in an Ayrshire cattle family. The chart includes several individuals with their respective phenotypes indicated by symbols:\n\n- Elsie: Open circle (mahogany)\n- Elmer: Open square (mahogany)\n- Elinor: Filled circle (red)\n- Earnest: Filled square (red)\n- Elmira: Open circle (mahogany)\n\nThe relationships between these individuals are depicted through lines connecting them, indicating parent-offspring relationships."
