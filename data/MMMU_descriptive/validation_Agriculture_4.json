    "description": "The image shows a young citrus tree with its roots exposed on a white paper placed on a wooden surface. The tree has a single main stem with several branches extending from it, each bearing green leaves. The roots appear to be somewhat tangled and spread out on the paper. In the background, there is a bag labeled \"FERTILIZER\" and some other items on the wooden surface. The overall setting appears to be indoors, possibly in a greenhouse or a gardening area."
