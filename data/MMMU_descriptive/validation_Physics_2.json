    "question": "<image 1>A conducting loop of wire that is initially around a magnet is pulled away from the magnet to the right, as indicated in the figure, inducing a current in the loop. What is the direction of the force on the magnet and the direction of the magnetic field at the center of the loop due to the induced current?Force on the Magnet/Magnetic Field at Center of Loop due To Induced Current",
    "options": "['To the right/To the right', 'To the right/To the left', 'To the left/To the right', 'No direction; the force is zero./To the left']",

    "description": "The image depicts a bar magnet with its north (N) and south (S) poles labeled. A conducting loop of wire is shown encircling the magnet near its north pole. The loop is being pulled away from the magnet to the right, as indicated by an arrow labeled \"Direction Loop is Pulled.\" The magnetic field lines emanate from the north pole of the magnet and curve around to the south pole."
