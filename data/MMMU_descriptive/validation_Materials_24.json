    "description": "The image depicts a two-dimensional representation of a crystal lattice structure. The lattice consists of six green spheres arranged in a hexagonal pattern. The distances between the spheres are labeled with mathematical expressions involving square roots: \\(a\\sqrt{2}\\) and \\(a\\sqrt{3}\\). These distances suggest specific geometrical relationships within the lattice.\n\nThe arrangement of the spheres and the distances between them indicate that this is a face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice. The distances \\(a\\sqrt{2}\\) and \\(a\\sqrt{3}\\) correspond to the diagonal distances across the faces and the body diagonal of the unit cell, respectively, which are characteristic features of an FCC lattice.\n\nGiven this information, the correct option from the provided choices is:\n\nF. FCC {110}"
