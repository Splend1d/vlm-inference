    "description": "The image depicts an electrical circuit known as a ladder network. The circuit consists of four identical stages, each containing a capacitor and a resistor connected in parallel. The capacitors have a capacitance of 0.5 \u03bcF (microfarads), and the resistors have a resistance of 10 k\u03a9 (kilohms). The input voltage \\( V_{in} \\) is applied to the left side of the network, and the output voltage \\( V_{out} \\) is taken from the right side of the network. The frequency of the input signal is given as \u03c9 = 100 rad/s (radians per second).\n\nEach stage of the ladder network has the same configuration, with the capacitors and resistors connected in parallel. This type of network is often used in filter circuits to modify the phase and amplitude of the input signal.\n\nTo find the phase of \\( V_{out} \\) when \\( V_{in} = 100 \\angle 0^\\circ \\) mV, we need to analyze the behavior of the capacitors and resistors at the given frequency. The phase shift introduced by each stage depends on the impedance of the capacitors and resistors at the operating frequency."
