    "description": "The image shows two chemical structures labeled as (A) and (B). \n\n- Structure (A) consists of a benzene ring with a nitro group (-NO2) attached at the para position (the fourth carbon atom from the starting point). Attached to the same carbon as the nitro group is an N,N-dimethylamino group (-N(CH3)2).\n\n- Structure (B) also has a benzene ring with a nitro group (-NO2) attached at the para position. However, in addition to the nitro group, there are three methyl groups (-CH3) attached to the benzene ring: one at the ortho position (second carbon atom), one at the meta position (third carbon atom), and one at the para position (fourth carbon atom). The N,N-dimethylamino group is attached to the same carbon as the nitro group.\n\nThe dipole moments for these compounds are given as:\n- (A) = 6.87 D\n- (B) = 4.11 D"
