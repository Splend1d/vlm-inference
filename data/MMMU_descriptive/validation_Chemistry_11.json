    "description": "The image is a titration curve graph with pH values plotted on the y-axis ranging from 0 to 14 and volume (in milliliters) plotted on the x-axis ranging from 0 to 60. The curve starts at a low pH value near 1 and gradually increases as the volume increases. At around 50 milliliters, there is a sharp increase in the pH, indicating the equivalence point, where the pH jumps significantly. The equivalence point is marked by a dot labeled \"Equivalence point.\" The curve then continues to rise steeply, approaching a pH value of 12. This type of curve is characteristic of a strong base being titrated into a strong acid."
