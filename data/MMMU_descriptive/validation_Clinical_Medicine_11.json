    "description": "The image shows a close-up view of a tongue with four sections marked by lines. The tongue is divided into two vertical sections and two horizontal sections, creating four quadrants. Each quadrant is labeled with a number: 1, 2, 3, and 4. Quadrant 1 is located at the bottom left, quadrant 2 at the bottom right, quadrant 3 at the top right, and quadrant 4 at the top left. The tongue appears to have a normal texture and color in all four quadrants."
