UNITS SOLD.\" The table lists the number of units sold for different years:\n\n- In 1950, 1000 units were sold.\n- In 1955, 1100 units were sold.\n- In 1960, 1210 units were sold.\n- In 1965, 1331 units were sold.\n\nBased on this data, the number of units sold increases each year. To estimate the sales in units for 1970, we need to identify the pattern or trend in the increase of units sold over the years."
