    "description": "The image depicts a payoff matrix for a prisoners' dilemma game involving two firms, labeled Firm 1 and Firm 2. The strategies available to each firm are \"Low output\" and \"High output.\" The payoffs, represented as profits, are shown in a table with Firm 1's strategies listed vertically on the left side and Firm 2's strategies listed horizontally at the top.\n\nThe payoffs are as follows:\n\n- If both firms choose \"Low output,\" the profit for each firm is 3.\n- If Firm 1 chooses \"Low output\" and Firm 2 chooses \"High output,\" the profit for Firm 1 is 0 and for Firm 2 is 5.\n- If Firm 1 chooses \"High output\" and Firm 2 chooses \"Low output,\" the profit for Firm 1 is 5 and for Firm 2 is 0.\n- If both firms choose \"High output,\" the profit for each firm is 2.\n\nAdditionally, there is a note indicating that \"Low output\" leads to a \"High price\" and \"High output\" leads to a \"Low price.\"\n\nBased on this information, the dominant strategy can be determined by analyzing the payoffs for each firm under different scenarios."
