    "options": "['The findings show an adenoma', 'The findings show a squamous cell carcinoma', 'The findings show intestinal type adenocarcinoma', 'The findings show diffuse signet ring cell adenocarcinoma']",

    "description": "The image depicts a microscopic view of tissue stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), which is commonly used in histopathology to examine tissue samples. The tissue appears to have glandular structures, which are indicative of epithelial cells. The staining reveals a mixture of pink and purple hues, with some areas showing more densely packed cells and others showing more dispersed cells. The presence of glandular formations suggests that the tissue is from an organ with glandular components, such as the stomach. The overall architecture and cellular arrangement do not resemble the typical appearance of benign adenomas or squamous cell carcinomas. Instead, the pattern is more consistent with adenocarcinoma, particularly one that exhibits features of intestinal differentiation."
