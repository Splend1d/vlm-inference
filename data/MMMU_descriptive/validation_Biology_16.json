    "description": "The image is a periodic table representation focusing on the electron configurations of elements from Groups 1, 14, 17, and 18 across Periods 1, 2, and 3. Each element is depicted with its atomic symbol and electron shells, showing how electrons are distributed in different energy levels.\n\n- **Group 1 (Alkali Metals)**: Elements in this group have one valence electron. The elements shown are Hydrogen (H), Lithium (Li), and Sodium (Na).\n- **Group 14 (Carbon Group)**: Elements in this group have four valence electrons. The elements shown are Carbon (C) and Silicon (Si).\n- **Group 17 (Halogens)**: Elements in this group have seven valence electrons. The elements shown are Fluorine (F) and Chlorine (Cl).\n- **Group 18 (Noble Gases)**: Elements in this group have eight valence electrons (except for Helium, which has two). The elements shown are Helium (He), Neon (Ne), and Argon (Ar).\n\nThe electron configurations are illustrated with concentric circles representing different energy levels, and dots representing electrons within those levels. The outermost shell (valence shell) is particularly highlighted to show the number of valence electrons each element has.\n\nBased on this information, the elements in Group 1 (with one valence electron) and Group 17 (with seven valence electrons) are likely to form strong ionic bonds because elements in Group 1 tend to lose their single valence electron easily, while elements in Group 17 tend to gain one electron to achieve a stable electron configuration."
