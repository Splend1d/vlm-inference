    "description": "The image depicts an electrical circuit with three impedances (\\(\\tilde{Z}_1\\), \\(\\tilde{Z}_2\\), and \\(\\tilde{Z}_3\\)) and two voltage sources. The circuit is arranged in a loop configuration with nodes labeled \\(n_1\\) and \\(n_2\\). Here are the details:\n\n1. **Voltage Sources:**\n   - There is a voltage source on the left with a magnitude of 100 V at an angle of 0\u00b0.\n   - There is another voltage source on the right with a magnitude of 50 V at an angle of 90\u00b0.\n\n2. **Impedances:**\n   - \\(\\tilde{Z}_1 = 5 \\angle 0\u00b0 \\Omega\\)\n   - \\(\\tilde{Z}_2 = 10 \\angle 36.9\u00b0 \\Omega\\)\n   - \\(\\tilde{Z}_3 = 20 \\angle 53.1\u00b0 \\Omega\\)\n\n3. **Currents:**\n   - Current \\(\\tilde{I}_1\\) flows through \\(\\tilde{Z}_1\\) from left to right.\n   - Current \\(\\tilde{I}_2\\) flows through \\(\\tilde{Z}_2\\) from top to bottom.\n   - Current \\(\\tilde{I}_3\\) flows through \\(\\tilde{Z}_3\\) from bottom to top.\n\n4. **Nodes:**\n   - Node \\(n_1\\) is where \\(\\tilde{Z}_1\\), \\(\\tilde{Z}_2\\), and \\(\\tilde{Z}_3\\) meet.\n   - Node \\(n_2\\) is the reference node at the bottom.\n\n5. **Phasor Voltage \\(V_C\\):**\n   - \\(V_C\\) is the voltage across \\(\\tilde{Z}_3\\).\n\nTo find the amplitude of the phasor voltage \\(V_C\\), we need to analyze the circuit using Kirchhoff's laws and impedance calculations. However, the specific steps to solve for \\(V_C\\) involve complex impedance calculations and may require additional information or simplifications not provided in the image description alone."
