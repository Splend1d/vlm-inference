    "description": "The image shows two sections of tissue stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), which is commonly used in histopathology to examine tissue samples. The tissue appears to have a dense cellular structure with areas of high cellularity and some regions that seem to be more sparsely populated with cells. There are also regions that appear to be necrotic or undergoing degeneration, indicated by the presence of red-stained areas. The overall appearance suggests a highly proliferative and invasive tumor. \n\nGiven the context of a 3-year-old male with a large posterior fossa tumor, the histological features are most consistent with:\n\nA. ependymoma"
