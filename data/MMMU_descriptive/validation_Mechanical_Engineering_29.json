    "description": "The image depicts a mechanical system consisting of a vertical shaft with a circular disk attached at its top. The shaft is supported by three torsional springs labeled \\( k_1 \\), \\( k_2 \\), and \\( k_3 \\) along its length. At the top of the shaft, there is a circular disk with radius \\( R \\). Attached to the disk are two linear springs labeled \\( k_5 \\) and \\( k_6 \\), which are connected to fixed points outside the disk. Additionally, there is a torsional spring labeled \\( k_4 \\) connected to the center of the disk.\n\nThe system appears to be designed to analyze the equivalent torsional spring constant of the combined system, considering both the torsional springs along the shaft and the linear springs attached to the disk. The angle \\( \\theta \\) represents the angular displacement of the disk relative to its initial position.\n\nGiven this setup, the equivalent torsional spring constant \\( k_{et} \\) can be calculated by combining the effects of all the springs involved. The torsional springs \\( k_1 \\), \\( k_2 \\), and \\( k_3 \\) are in series along the shaft, while the linear springs \\( k_5 \\) and \\( k_6 \\) contribute to the overall torsional stiffness through their connection to the disk.\n\nThe correct formula for the equivalent torsional spring constant \\( k_{et} \\) is:\n\n\\[ k_{et} = \\left( \\frac{k_1 k_2 k_3}{k_2 k_3 + k_1 k_3 + k_1 k_2} \\right) + k_4 + R^2 (k_5 + k_6) \\]\n\nThis formula accounts for the series combination of the torsional springs \\( k_1 \\), \\( k_2 \\), and \\( k_3 \\), the direct contribution of the torsional spring \\( k_4 \\) at the disk, and the contribution of the linear springs \\( k_5 \\) and \\( k_6 \\) through the radius \\( R \\) squared.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. \\( k_{et} = \\left( \\frac{k_1 k_2 k_3}{k_2 k_3 + k_1 k_3 + k_1 k_2} \\right) + k_4 + R^2 (k_5 + k_6) \\)"
