    "description": "The image consists of two parts: a graph and a table.\n\n### Graph Description:\n- The graph is labeled \"Fig. 12.5.\"\n- The x-axis ranges from 0 to 160 meters.\n- The y-axis is not explicitly labeled but represents the offset length in meters.\n- There is a curve that starts at point A at the origin (0, 0) and ends at point B at (160, 0).\n- The curve has several peaks and troughs, indicating varying offset lengths at different distances along the line AB.\n\n### Table Description:\n- The table lists the offset lengths at regular intervals of 20 meters along the line AB.\n- The first column lists the points along the line AB, starting from A at 0 meters and ending at B at 160 meters.\n- The second column lists the distance in meters from point A.\n- The third column lists the corresponding offset lengths in meters at each distance point.\n\n### Data from the Table:\n- At 0 meters (point A), the offset length is 23 meters.\n- At 20 meters, the offset length is 40 meters.\n- At 40 meters, the offset length is 42 meters.\n- At 60 meters, the offset length is 30 meters.\n- At 80 meters, the offset length is 32 meters.\n- At 100 meters, the offset length is 60 meters.\n- At 120 meters, the offset length is 10 meters.\n- At 140 meters, the offset length is 14 meters.\n- At 160 meters (point B), the offset length is 22 meters.\n\n### Answering the Question:\nTo determine the area in hectares between the line AB and the meandering stream using the trapezoidal rule and Simpson's rule, we need to calculate the area under the curve represented by the offset lengths at regular intervals.\n\n1. **Trapezoidal Rule:**\n   - The trapezoidal rule approximates the area under the curve by dividing it into trapezoids and summing their areas.\n   - The formula for the trapezoidal rule is: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Area} = \\frac{h}{2} \\left( y_0 + 2(y_1 + y_2 + \\cdots + y_{n-1}) + y_n \\right)\n     \\]\n   - Where \\( h \\) is the interval (20 meters in this case), and \\( y_i \\) are the offset lengths at each interval.\n\n2. **Simpson's Rule:**\n   - Simpson's rule provides a more accurate approximation by fitting parabolic arcs between the points.\n   - The formula for Simpson's rule is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Area} = \\frac{h}{3} \\left( y_0 + 4(y_1 + y_3 + \\cdots + y_{n-1}) + 2(y_2 + y_4 + \\cdots + y_{n-2}) + y_n \\right)\n     \\]\n\nUsing these formulas with the given data, we can calculate the area in square meters and then convert it to hectares (1 hectare = 10,000 square meters).\n\nAfter performing the calculations, the correct answer is:\n\n**A. Use trapezoidal rule, area = 0.5010 hectares; Use trapezoidal rule, area = 0.5560 hectares**"
