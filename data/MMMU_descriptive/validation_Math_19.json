    "description": "The first image (Image 1) depicts a graph with six vertices and eight edges labeled \\( e_1 \\) to \\( e_8 \\). The vertices are connected by these edges in a specific configuration:\n\n- Vertex \\( x \\) is connected to three other vertices by edges \\( e_1 \\), \\( e_2 \\), and \\( e_4 \\).\n- Edge \\( e_1 \\) connects vertex \\( x \\) to a vertex on the bottom left.\n- Edge \\( e_2 \\) connects vertex \\( x \\) to a vertex on the top left.\n- Edge \\( e_4 \\) connects vertex \\( x \\) to a vertex on the right.\n- Edge \\( e_3 \\) connects the top left vertex to the top right vertex.\n- Edge \\( e_5 \\) connects the bottom left vertex to the bottom right vertex.\n- Edge \\( e_6 \\) connects the bottom left vertex to the middle vertex on the bottom.\n- Edge \\( e_7 \\) connects the top right vertex to the middle vertex on the bottom.\n- Edge \\( e_8 \\) connects the middle vertex on the bottom to the vertex on the right.\n\nThe second image (Image 2) shows a spanning tree of the graph from Image 1. The spanning tree includes the following edges:\n- \\( e_1 \\)\n- \\( e_2 \\)\n- \\( e_4 \\)\n- \\( e_5 \\)\n- \\( e_6 \\)\n- \\( e_8 \\)\n\nTo find the fundamental cut sets of Image 1 with respect to Image 2, we need to identify the sets of edges that, when removed, disconnect the spanning tree into two components. Each fundamental cut set corresponds to an edge in Image 1 that is not part of the spanning tree in Image 2.\n\nThe fundamental cut sets are:\n- The set containing \\( e_1 \\) and \\( e_8 \\), which disconnects the bottom left vertex from the rest of the tree.\n- The set containing \\( e_2 \\), \\( e_4 \\), and \\( e_8 \\), which disconnects the top left vertex from the rest of the tree.\n- The set containing \\( e_3 \\) and \\( e_7 \\), which disconnects the top right vertex from the rest of the tree.\n- The set containing \\( e_5 \\), \\( e_7 \\), and \\( e_8 \\), which disconnects the middle vertex on the bottom from the rest of the tree.\n- The set containing \\( e_6 \\) and \\( e_8 \\), which disconnects the bottom left vertex from the rest of the tree.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. {\\( e_1 \\), \\( e_8 \\)}, {\\( e_2 \\), \\( e_4 \\), \\( e_8 \\)}, {\\( e_3 \\), \\( e_7 \\)}, {\\( e_5 \\), \\( e_7 \\), \\( e_8 \\)}, {\\( e_6 \\), \\( e_8 \\)}"
