    "question": "A man at a point P on the shore of a circular lake of radius 1 mile wants to reach the point Q on the shore diametrically opposite P (Fig. 16-5). He can row 1.5 miles per hour and walk 3 miles per hour. At what angle $\\theta $ ($0<\\theta < \\pi /2$) to the diameter PQ should he row in order to minimize the time required to reach Q? <image 1>",

    "description": "The image depicts a circular lake with a radius of 1 mile. Points P and Q are located on the circumference of the circle, with Q being diametrically opposite P. The center of the circle is labeled O. A line segment PR is drawn from point P to a point R on the circumference, forming an angle \u03b8 with the diameter PQ. Another line segment QR is also shown, forming an angle of 2\u03b8 with the diameter PQ. The angles \u03b8 and 2\u03b8 are clearly marked in the diagram. The goal is to determine the angle \u03b8 at which the man should row from P to R in order to minimize the time required to reach Q, given that he can row at 1.5 miles per hour and walk at 3 miles per hour."
