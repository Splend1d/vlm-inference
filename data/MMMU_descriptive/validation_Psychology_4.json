    "description": "The image is a flowchart that outlines a specific theory related to emotions. The flowchart consists of several colored boxes connected by arrows, indicating the sequence of events or processes involved in this theory. Here is a detailed description of each component:\n\n1. **Emotional-Inducing Stimulus (Pink Box)**: This box represents an external event or situation that triggers an emotional response.\n2. **Physiological Response (Blue Box)**: Arrows lead from the \"Emotional-Inducing Stimulus\" to this box, indicating that the stimulus causes a physical reaction in the body.\n3. **Conscious Cognitive Interpretation (Purple Box)**: Another arrow leads from the \"Emotional-Inducing Stimulus\" to this box, suggesting that the stimulus also prompts a mental interpretation or understanding of the situation.\n4. **Behavioral Response (Green Box)**: Arrows converge from both the \"Physiological Response\" and the \"Conscious Cognitive Interpretation\" to this box, indicating that both the physical and mental responses contribute to the resulting behavior.\n5. **Labeling of Emotion (Teal Box)**: An arrow leads from the \"Behavioral Response\" to this box, suggesting that the final step involves identifying or naming the emotion experienced.\n\nBased on this flowchart, the theory depicted is the Schachter-Singer Theory, which posits that emotions result from a combination of physiological arousal and cognitive labeling of that arousal."
