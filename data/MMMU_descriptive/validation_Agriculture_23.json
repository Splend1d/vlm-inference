    "question": "<image 1> Examine the detached branches of Gliricidia sepium, a common species used in tropical agroforestry. How does the sickly, yellowed leaves on the left contrast with the normal growth adjacent to it, given that both are part of the same tree? The symptoms are not evenly spread across the crown of the tree. Have you noticed that some of the branches have begun to die?",

    "description": "The image shows two detached branches of Gliricidia sepium lying on the ground. The branch on the left has sickly, yellowed leaves, indicating signs of distress or disease. In contrast, the branch on the right appears healthy with normal green leaves. The difference between the two branches is quite stark, suggesting that the symptoms affecting the left branch are localized and not evenly spread across the entire tree. This observation implies that some branches may be experiencing issues while others remain unaffected."
