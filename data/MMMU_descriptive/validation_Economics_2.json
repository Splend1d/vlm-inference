    "question": "<image 1> Suppose the government decided that, since gasoline is a necessity, its price should be legally capped at $1.30 per gallon. What do you anticipate would be the outcome in the gasoline market?",
    "options": "['A price below that of 1.30 dollars would cause a situation of excess demand and hence a surplus.', 'A price below that of 1.30 dollars would cause a situation of excess demand and hence a shortage.', 'Not certain.']",

    "description": "The image is a graph depicting the supply and demand for gasoline. The x-axis represents the quantity of gasoline in millions of gallons, ranging from 300 to 900 million gallons. The y-axis represents the price per gallon in dollars, ranging from $0.60 to $2.20.\n\nThe graph shows two curves:\n- The demand curve (D) is downward sloping, indicating that as the price decreases, the quantity demanded increases.\n- The supply curve (S) is upward sloping, indicating that as the price increases, the quantity supplied increases.\n\nThe equilibrium point (E) is where the supply and demand curves intersect, at a price of $1.40 per gallon and a quantity of 600 million gallons.\n\nThe graph also highlights different scenarios:\n- At a price above the equilibrium ($1.80), there is an excess supply or surplus.\n- At a price below the equilibrium ($1.20), there is an excess demand or shortage.\n\nBased on this information, if the government caps the price at $1.30 per gallon, which is below the equilibrium price of $1.40, it would result in an excess demand or shortage."
