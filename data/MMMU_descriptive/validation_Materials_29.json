    "description": "The image shows a table with data for three hypothetical alloys labeled A, B, and C. The table includes the following columns: Alloy, Atomic Weight (g/mol), Density (g/cm\u00b3), and Atomic Radius (nm). The specific values for each alloy are as follows:\n\n- **Alloy A**:\n  - Atomic Weight: 43.1 g/mol\n  - Density: 6.40 g/cm\u00b3\n  - Atomic Radius: 0.122 nm\n\n- **Alloy B**:\n  - Atomic Weight: 184.4 g/mol\n  - Density: 12.30 g/cm\u00b3\n  - Atomic Radius: 0.146 nm\n\n- **Alloy C**:\n  - Atomic Weight: 91.6 g/mol\n  - Density: 9.60 g/cm\u00b3\n  - Atomic Radius: 0.137 nm"
