    "question": "This microscopic image <image 1>",
    "options": "['shows the typical pattern of a subependymoma', 'is benign and slow growing', 'commonly intraventricular', 'all are correct']",
    "id": "validation_Diagnostics_and_Laboratory_Medicine_4",
    "description": "The image depicts a microscopic view of tissue with a characteristic pattern. The tissue appears to have a dense aggregation of cells with a somewhat uniform appearance. The cells are arranged in clusters and have a distinct staining pattern, with some areas showing a lighter coloration and others appearing darker. This pattern is indicative of a specific type of tumor known as a subependymoma. Subependymomas are typically benign and grow slowly. They are commonly found within the ventricles of the brain. Based on these observations, the image likely represents a subependymoma, which aligns with the characteristics described in the question."
