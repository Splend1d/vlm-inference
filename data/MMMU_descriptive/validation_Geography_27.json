    "description": "The image depicts a cross-sectional view of a soil sample with a cone penetrometer inserted into it. The penetrometer has sunk 6mm into the soil, indicating the depth of penetration. The soil sample is labeled as a cohesive soil undisturbed sample with a weight of 76 grams. The depth of penetration is used to determine the consistency of the soil. \n\nGiven the depth of penetration (6mm), we can infer the consistency of the soil sample. The options provided are:\n\nA. Hard plastic\nB. Plastic\nC. Soft plastic\nD. Flow molding\n\nBased on the depth of penetration, the soil sample likely falls into one of these categories."
