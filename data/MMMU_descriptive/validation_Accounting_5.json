    "question": "The following data show the units in beginning work in process inventory, the number of units started, the number of units transferred, and the percent completion of the ending work in process for conversion. Given that materials are added at the beginning of the process, what are the equivalent units for conversion costs for each quarter using the weighted-average method? Assume that the quarters are independent.<image 1>",
