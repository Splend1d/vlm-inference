    "description": "The image shows an electrocardiogram (ECG) tracing. The ECG paper has a grid pattern with small squares, each representing 0.04 seconds horizontally and 0.1 millivolts vertically. The tracing displays a series of regular, upright QRS complexes with consistent intervals between them. There are no visible P waves preceding the QRS complexes, suggesting that the atrial activity is not being conducted through the normal pathway. The baseline appears stable, and there are no significant arrhythmias or irregularities in the rhythm. The overall appearance suggests a junctional rhythm, which is characterized by the absence of P waves and regular QRS complexes."
