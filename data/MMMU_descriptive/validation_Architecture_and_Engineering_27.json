    "question": "A surveyor needs to know the distance between points C and B in Figure 2.17. A building obscures the view directly between the two points. Setting up at the end of the building at point A, the surveyor measures the two distances AC and AB, and the interior angle at A. What is the desired distance, CB?<image 1>",
    "options": "[\"Distance CB = 748.50'\", \"Distance CB = 748.70'\", \"Distance CB = 748.60'\", \"Distance CB = 748.40'\"]",

    "description": "The image shows a geometric diagram labeled \"FIGURE 2.17 Sketch for Example 2.12.\" The diagram includes three points labeled A, B, and C, with a building (BLDG) positioned between points B and C. The distances from point A to points B and C are given as follows:\n- Distance AB (c) = 566.81 feet\n- Distance AC (b) = 591.13 feet\n\nThe angle at point A between lines AB and AC is given as 80\u00b030'. The task is to determine the distance between points C and B (distance CB), which is labeled as 'a' in the diagram."
