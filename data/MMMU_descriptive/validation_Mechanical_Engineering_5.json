    "description": "The image depicts a block diagram of a control system. The system consists of two main components: a forward path and a feedback path.\n\n1. **Forward Path**:\n   - The input signal \\( R(s) \\) enters the system.\n   - There is a summing junction where \\( R(s) \\) and the feedback signal are combined. The output of this summing junction is \\( E(s) \\).\n   - The transfer function in the forward path is given by:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{K(s + 1)}{s(s + 2)(s + 3)}\n     \\]\n   - The output of the forward path is \\( C(s) \\).\n\n2. **Feedback Path**:\n   - The feedback signal is taken from \\( C(s) \\) and passed through a transfer function:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{s + 5}{s + 7}\n     \\]\n   - This feedback signal is then subtracted from \\( R(s) \\) at the summing junction.\n\nThe overall system is a closed-loop system with a feedback mechanism. The stability of the system can be determined using the Routh-Hurwitz criterion by analyzing the characteristic equation of the closed-loop system."
