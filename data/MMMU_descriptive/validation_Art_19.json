    "description": "The image consists of three separate photos labeled 1, 2, and 3.\n\n1. The first photo shows three figures dressed in dark clothing walking on a paved surface with geometric patterns. The background is mostly empty, creating a sense of negative space around the figures.\n\n2. The second photo features a series of cylindrical pendant lights hanging from the ceiling. The lights have a pattern of small holes that allow light to pass through, creating a dotted effect. The background is dark, which emphasizes the illuminated areas and creates a contrast with the negative space.\n\n3. The third photo depicts two large, cone-shaped structures made of interlocking bricks or blocks. The structures are set against a clear blue sky, with the negative space between them and the sky being prominent.\n\nBased on this description, the image that features a strong use of negative space is:\n\nD. Photo 3"
