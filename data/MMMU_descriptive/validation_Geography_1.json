    "description": "The image depicts a fixed straight rod with a series of torsion couples applied along its length. The rod is divided into two sections labeled 1-1 and 2-2. \n\n- At section 1-1, there is a torsion couple of 1 kN\u00b7m.\n- Between sections 1-1 and 2-2, there is an additional torsion couple of 4.5 kN\u00b7m.\n- At section 2-2, there is another torsion couple of 2 kN\u00b7m.\n- Further along the rod, there is a torsion couple of 5 kN\u00b7m.\n\nTo determine the torque at sections 1-1 and 2-2, we need to consider the cumulative effect of all the torsion couples acting between these sections."
