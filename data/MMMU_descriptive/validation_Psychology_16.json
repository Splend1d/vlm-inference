    "question": "Researchers studying vision use various methods to investigate human perceptual experience. Research on spectral sensitivity of the rod receptors (scattered throughout the retina) and cone visual receptors (mainly concentrated in the fovea area of the retina) highlights the relationship between perception and physiology. Signal detection methods have been used to measure the differences in how perception adjusts to low-light environments. Participant responses can be plotted based on sensitivity versus length of time in the dark. The dark adaptation curve can be plotted showing how rods and cones differ in their sensitivity to light over time. The following graph shows a plot of three calculated dark adaptation curves. <image 1> Which of the following statements is true?",
    "options": "['Rods are responsible for color vision, which explains color sensitivity under low-light conditions.', 'Cones are responsible for color vision, which explains greater color sensitivity under low-light conditions.', 'Rods do not respond preferentially to wavelengths in the light spectrum, which explains why colors are not detectable in low-light conditions.', 'Both rods and cones respond to specific colors in the light spectrum; loss of color vision in dark conditions is the result of fewer photons of light.']",

    "description": "The image is a graph depicting three dark adaptation curves, which illustrate how human light sensitivity changes over time when transitioning from a light-adapted state to a dark-adapted state. The x-axis represents time in minutes, ranging from 0 to approximately 30 minutes, while the y-axis represents light levels, with higher values indicating lower sensitivity and lower values indicating higher sensitivity.\n\nThere are three curves on the graph:\n1. A solid line representing the overall human light sensitivity, which includes both rod and cone receptor types.\n2. A dashed line labeled \"Rod,\" which shows the sensitivity of rod receptors.\n3. Another dashed line labeled \"Cone,\" which shows the sensitivity of cone receptors.\n\nKey features of the graph include:\n- The \"Light-adapted sensitivity\" level at the beginning of the graph, where both rod and cone sensitivities start.\n- The \"Rod-cone break\" point, where the rod and cone curves diverge.\n- The \"Maximum cone sensitivity\" level, which is reached after about 10 minutes in the dark.\n- The \"Dark-adapted sensitivity\" level, which is reached by the rod curve after about 20 minutes in the dark.\n- The \"Maximum rod sensitivity\" level, which is the lowest point on the rod curve, indicating the highest sensitivity to light.\n\nThe graph also indicates that rods adapt more quickly to low-light conditions than cones, reaching maximum sensitivity faster."
