    "description": "The image depicts a detailed diagram of a cell membrane, highlighting various components and regions. The cell membrane is composed of a phospholipid bilayer, with hydrophilic heads (polar) facing outward and hydrophobic tails (nonpolar) facing inward. \n\n- **A** represents the hydrophilic heads of the phospholipids, which are attracted to water.\n- **B** indicates a glycolipid, which has a carbohydrate chain attached to a lipid molecule.\n- **C** shows a glycoprotein, which has a carbohydrate chain attached to a protein.\n- **D** points to a cholesterol molecule, which helps stabilize the membrane.\n- **E** highlights the hydrophobic tails of the phospholipids, which are not attracted to water and form the interior of the bilayer.\n\nGiven this information, the hydrophobic region of the cell membrane corresponds to the area labeled **E**, where the nonpolar tails of the phospholipids are located."
