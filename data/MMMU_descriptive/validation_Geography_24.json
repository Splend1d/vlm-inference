The rod is shown in a horizontal orientation with its left end fixed against a vertical surface. At the right end of the rod, there are two forces acting: a torque (T) applied tangentially and a force (F) applied perpendicularly. The coordinate system is defined with the x-axis along the length of the rod, the y-axis pointing upwards, and the z-axis pointing into the page. The point where the rod is fixed against the vertical surface is labeled as \"A.\""
