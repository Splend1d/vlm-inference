    "question": "A model rocket is launched from rest with a constant upward acceleration of 3 m /s^2 under the action of a small thruster. The thruster shuts off after 8 seconds, and the rocket continues upward until it reaches its apex. At apex, a small chute opens which ensures that the rocket falls at a constant speed of 0.85 m /s until it impacts the ground. Determine the maximum height h attained by the rocket and the total flight time. Neglect aerodynamic drag during ascent, and assume that the mass of the rocket and the acceleration of gravity are both constant.<image 1>",

    "description": "The image depicts a model rocket being launched vertically. The rocket starts from rest and accelerates upward at a constant rate of 3 m/s\u00b2 for 8 seconds due to a small thruster. After 8 seconds, the thruster shuts off, and the rocket continues to move upward until it reaches its apex. At the apex, a small parachute deploys, causing the rocket to descend at a constant speed of 0.85 m/s until it impacts the ground. The diagram shows two stages: the initial launch phase with the thruster active and the descent phase with the parachute deployed. The height \\( h \\) represents the maximum height attained by the rocket."
