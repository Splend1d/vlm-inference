The third point is at the peak of the graph, forming a sharp angle with the previous line. The fourth point is connected to the third point with a downward-sloping line, indicating a decrease or fall. There is an orange arrow pointing downwards next to the second point, which suggests a transition from the rising part of the graph to the falling part."
