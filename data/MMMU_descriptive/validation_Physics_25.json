    "description": "The image shows a converging lens with a focal length labeled as \\( f \\). The object is placed at a distance of 1.5f from the lens. The diagram includes a horizontal line representing the optical axis, with markings indicating distances of \\( f \\), \\( 2f \\), and \\( 3f \\) on either side of the lens. The object is positioned between \\( f \\) and \\( 2f \\) on the left side of the lens."
