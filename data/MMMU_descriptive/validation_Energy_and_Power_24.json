    "description": "The image depicts a forward feed evaporator system consisting of three stages labeled 1, 2, and 3. The process begins with steam entering stage 1, where it condenses and releases heat to evaporate the feed solution. The condensate exits stage 1 and is collected separately. The concentrated solution from stage 1 then flows into stage 2, where further evaporation occurs using additional steam. Similarly, the concentrated solution from stage 2 flows into stage 3 for further concentration. Each stage has its own heating element represented by the wavy lines, indicating the application of heat through steam.\n\nGiven this setup, the capacity of the forward feed evaporator is determined by the combined capacities of all three stages since the feed solution passes sequentially through each stage. Therefore, the total capacity is the sum of the capacities of stages 1, 2, and 3.\n\nBased on this description, the correct answer to the question is:\n\nA. E1 + E2 + E3"
