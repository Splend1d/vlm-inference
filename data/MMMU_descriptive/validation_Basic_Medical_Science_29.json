    "question": "Huntington disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a degeneration of the striatum and cortex of the brain. Patients show motor abnormalities, personality changes, a gradual loss of higher brain functions, and eventually die. Below <image 1> is a family pedigree and an accompanying Southern blot that was obtained with genomic DNA that was probed with a DNA complementary to the gene for the Huntingtin protein. Based on the linked image above, which statement is most likely to be CORRECT?",
    "options": "['HD is an autosomal recessive disease', 'The huntingtin gene is likely to be located on the X-chromosome', 'A likely cause of HD is an unstable triplet repeat in the HD gene', 'The pattern of bands in the blot is indicative of abnormal splicing of the HD mRNA', 'In most individuals, the region of the HD gene detected by the DNA probe is distributed on six different restriction fragments']",

    "description": "The image consists of two main parts: a family pedigree and a Southern blot.\n\n### Family Pedigree:\n- The pedigree is divided into three generations labeled I, II, and III.\n- Generation I includes one male (represented by a square) and one female (represented by a circle). The female is shaded black, indicating she has the trait or condition being studied.\n- Generation II includes one male and one female. The female is shaded black, indicating she has the trait or condition.\n- Generation III includes one individual, who is shaded black, indicating they have the trait or condition.\n\n### Southern Blot:\n- The Southern blot shows a series of lanes with DNA fragments separated by gel electrophoresis.\n- Each lane contains multiple bands, representing different DNA fragments.\n- The bands vary in size, with some lanes having more bands than others.\n- The pattern of bands suggests genetic variation among the individuals represented in the pedigree.\n\nBased on this description, the most likely correct statement is:\n\nC. A likely cause of HD is an unstable triplet repeat in the HD gene."
