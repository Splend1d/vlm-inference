    "options": "['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']",
    "id": "validation_Physics_19",
    "description": "The image consists of four graphs labeled (A), (B), (C), and (D). Each graph plots the maximum kinetic energy \\( K \\) of photoelectrons on the y-axis against the frequency of incident light on the x-axis.\n\n- Graph (A) shows a straight line with a positive slope, indicating a linear relationship between the maximum kinetic energy \\( K \\) and the frequency of incident light.\n- Graph (B) shows a straight line with a negative slope, indicating an inverse relationship between the maximum kinetic energy \\( K \\) and the frequency of incident light.\n- Graph (C) shows a curve that starts at a low value on the y-axis and increases rapidly as the frequency of incident light increases, indicating a non-linear but increasing relationship.\n- Graph (D) shows a curve that starts at a high value on the y-axis and decreases rapidly as the frequency of incident light increases, indicating a non-linear but decreasing relationship.\n\nBased on these descriptions, the correct graph that best shows the maximum kinetic energy \\( K \\) of the photoelectrons as a function of the frequency of incident light is:\n\nC.
