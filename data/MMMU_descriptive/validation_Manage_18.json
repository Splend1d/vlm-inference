    "description": "The image is labeled \"Figure 3.10 Mintzberg's metaphor of the Battle of Passchendaele.\" It features two distinct sections. On the left side, there is a depiction of soldiers in a muddy, war-torn landscape, with the text \"THE PITY OF WAR\" written above them. This section shows soldiers in trenches, surrounded by mud and debris, suggesting the harsh realities of combat.\n\nOn the right side, there is an illustration of a military officer holding a piece of paper with a geometric shape on it, labeled \"DESIGNED STRATEGY.\" The officer appears to be looking at the paper, seemingly unaware or detached from the actual conditions depicted on the left side. The officer is standing on a clean, flat surface, contrasting sharply with the chaotic and muddy battlefield scene.\n\nThe overall image contrasts the abstract planning and strategy represented by the officer with the grim reality of the soldiers in the trenches. This suggests a disconnect between theoretical planning and the actual experiences of those engaged in combat."
