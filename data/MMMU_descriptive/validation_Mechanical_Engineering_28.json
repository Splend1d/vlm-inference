    "description": "The image depicts a block diagram of a control system. The system consists of two main components connected in a feedback loop. \n\n1. **Forward Path Block**: This block represents the forward path of the system and has a transfer function given by:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{5}{s(s + 1)(s + 2)}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Feedback Path Block**: This block represents the feedback path of the system and has a transfer function given by:\n   \\[\n   (s + 3)\n   \\]\n\nThe input to the system is denoted as \\( R(s) \\), and the output is denoted as \\( C(s) \\). The system includes a summing junction where the input signal \\( R(s) \\) is compared with the feedback signal from the feedback path block. The difference between these signals is then fed into the forward path block.\n\nTo find the steady-state error for an input of \\( 50u(t) \\), we need to analyze the system's response to a step input. The steady-state error for a type 0 system (a system with no integrators in the forward path) can be calculated using the formula:\n\\[\ne_{ss} = \\frac{1}{K_p}\n\\]\nwhere \\( K_p \\) is the position error constant. For a step input, \\( K_p \\) is given by the DC gain of the open-loop transfer function.\n\nThe open-loop transfer function \\( G(s)H(s) \\) is the product of the forward path transfer function and the feedback path transfer function:\n\\[\nG(s)H(s) = \\frac{5}{s(s + 1)(s + 2)} \\cdot (s + 3)\n\\]\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n\\[\nG(s)H(s) = \\frac{5(s + 3)}{s(s + 1)(s + 2)}\n\\]\n\nThe DC gain \\( K_p \\) is the value of this transfer function at \\( s = 0 \\):\n\\[\nK_p = \\lim_{s \\to 0} \\frac{5(s + 3)}{s(s + 1)(s + 2)} = \\frac{5(3)}{0(1)(2)} = \\infty\n\\]\n\nSince \\( K_p \\) is infinite, the steady-state error \\( e_{ss} \\) for a step input is zero. Therefore, none of the provided options (A: 17.59, B: 27.59, C: 37.59) are correct."
