    "options": "['to enliven paintings through the use of scientific theories about color and optic function', \"to bring Classical structure to the Impressionists' approach to painting\", 'to use color to generate a strong emotional response from the viewer', 'to produce an idiosyncratic style characterized by the use of small dots of color']",

    "description": "The image depicts a vibrant outdoor scene in a park, characterized by a multitude of people engaged in various activities. The setting appears to be a sunny day, with trees providing shade and a body of water visible in the background. The figures are dressed in late 19th-century attire, suggesting a historical context. The painting is notable for its use of small, distinct dots of color, which create a sense of depth and movement when viewed from a distance. This technique is known as Pointillism, a hallmark of George Seurat's Divisionist style. The overall composition is structured and balanced, with careful attention to the placement of figures and objects within the scene."
