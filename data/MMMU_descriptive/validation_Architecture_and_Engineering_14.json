    "description": "The image depicts a structural engineering problem involving a cantilever beam with a load applied at point B. The beam is anchored at point A and extends horizontally to point B, where it changes direction and continues downward at an angle. The dimensions provided are as follows:\n\n- The horizontal segment from A to B is 8 feet long.\n- The inclined segment from B to the end of the beam is 12 feet long.\n- The vertical distance from the horizontal segment to the end of the inclined segment is 9 feet.\n- There is a spring support at the end of the inclined segment with a stiffness \\( k = 5 \\) kips/in.\n\nA concentrated load of 30 kips is applied vertically downward at point B.\n\nThe question asks to compute the initial deflection at midspan for the beam using a finite summation method, given the modulus of elasticity \\( E = 3000 \\) kips/in\\(^2\\) and assuming \\( I = 0.5I_G \\), where \\( I_G \\) is the moment of inertia of the gross section. The calculation should use 3-foot segments."
