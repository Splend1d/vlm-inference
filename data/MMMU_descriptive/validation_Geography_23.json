    "question": "The cantilever beam is subjected to a concentrated force P at the free end, and the cross-sectional shape and the action line of force P are shown in the figure What type of cross-section produces the combined deformation of oblique bending and torsion?<image 1>",
    "options": "['Rectangle', 'Channel steel', 'I-beam', 'Equilateral angle steel']",

    "description": "The image shows four different cross-sectional shapes of beams, each subjected to a concentrated force \\( P \\) at the free end. The cross-sectional shapes are:\n\n1. **Rectangle**: A simple rectangular cross-section.\n2. **Channel steel**: A C-shaped channel steel cross-section.\n3. **I-beam**: An I-shaped beam cross-section.\n4. **Equilateral angle steel**: An L-shaped angle steel cross-section.\n\nEach cross-section is depicted with the force \\( P \\) acting at an angle relative to the beam's axis, indicating that the force is not purely vertical but has both vertical and horizontal components. This angled force will cause a combination of bending and torsion in the beam."
