    "description": "The image is a population pyramid graph that displays demographic information for a specific country. The graph is divided into two sides: the left side represents males, and the right side represents females. The vertical axis indicates age, ranging from 0 to 110 years, while the horizontal axis represents the population in thousands, ranging from -4 to 4 thousand.\n\nThe graph shows a typical population pyramid with a wider base, indicating a larger number of younger individuals, and a narrower top, indicating fewer older individuals. The data points are represented by blue lines, labeled as \"observed,\" which likely indicate the actual observed population data.\n\nGiven the shape of the population pyramid, it suggests a developing country with a relatively young population and high birth rates. This type of demographic structure is often seen in countries with growing populations and lower life expectancy.\n\nBased on this description, the correct answer to the question is:\n\nA. Kenya"
