    "description": "The image depicts an old ash tree situated next to a main road. The tree has a large, sprawling canopy with many branches extending outward. Some of the branches appear to be withering, showing signs of decay and leaf loss. The surrounding area includes a grassy field and a few other trees in the background. There are also road signs indicating directions to nearby locations, such as Market Harborough and Northampton. The sky is partly cloudy, suggesting a typical day with some sunlight filtering through the clouds."
