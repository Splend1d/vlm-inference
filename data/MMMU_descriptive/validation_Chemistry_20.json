    "description": "The image depicts a complex organic molecule with several rings and functional groups. The molecule has a central ring system with multiple substituents attached to it. Specifically, there are two hydroxyl (OH) groups, one on each side of the central ring system. Additionally, there is an oxygen atom bonded to the central ring, forming an ether linkage. There is also a nitrogen atom with a methyl (CH3) group attached to it, which is part of a smaller ring structure connected to the central ring system. The molecule has a three-dimensional structure, indicated by the dashed and solid lines representing bonds coming out of or going into the plane of the paper."
