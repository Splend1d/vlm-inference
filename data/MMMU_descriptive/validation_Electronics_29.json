    "description": "The image depicts an electrical circuit diagram labeled \"Fig. 1.\" The circuit consists of two voltage sources: one with 6 volts (V) and another with 12 V. These sources are connected in parallel to a network of resistors. The resistors have values of 4 ohms, 3 ohms, 2 ohms, and 1 ohm. There is also a variable element labeled \"X\" which is specified to be a 2-ohm resistance in the question. The resistors are arranged in a series-parallel configuration, with the 4-ohm resistor in series with the 3-ohm resistor, and the 2-ohm resistor in series with the 1-ohm resistor. The two branches are then connected in parallel to the voltage sources."
