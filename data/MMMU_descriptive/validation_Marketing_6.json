    "description": "The image is a table titled \"Table 10.20\" which lists the starting and ending cholesterol levels of ten individuals who went on a low-fat diet for 12 weeks. The table has two columns: \"Starting cholesterol level\" and \"Ending cholesterol level.\" The rows contain the following data:\n\n- Starting cholesterol level: 140, Ending cholesterol level: 140\n- Starting cholesterol level: 220, Ending cholesterol level: 230\n- Starting cholesterol level: 110, Ending cholesterol level: 120\n- Starting cholesterol level: 240, Ending cholesterol level: 220\n- Starting cholesterol level: 200, Ending cholesterol level: 190\n- Starting cholesterol level: 180, Ending cholesterol level: 150\n- Starting cholesterol level: 190, Ending cholesterol level: 200\n- Starting cholesterol level: 360, Ending cholesterol level: 300\n- Starting cholesterol level: 280, Ending cholesterol level: 300\n- Starting cholesterol level: 260, Ending cholesterol level: 240\n\nBased on this data, we can see that some individuals had an increase in cholesterol levels, while others had a decrease. There is no clear pattern indicating a significant lowering or raising of cholesterol levels across all individuals. Therefore, at the 5% significance level, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that the low-fat diet significantly lowered cholesterol levels after 12 weeks."
