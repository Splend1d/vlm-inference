    "description": "The image shows two cross-sectional views of human brains side by side against a blue background. The brain on the left is labeled \"normal,\" indicating it is a healthy brain. The brain on the right appears to have noticeable differences compared to the normal brain. Specifically, the brain on the right shows significant enlargement of the ventricles (the fluid-filled cavities within the brain), which suggests a condition known as hydrocephalus or another form of ventricular enlargement. There is also visible atrophy in the cerebral cortex, particularly in the frontal and temporal lobes, which could indicate degenerative changes. The overall appearance of the brain on the right is more shrunken and has wider sulci (the grooves between the folds of the brain), which are indicative of cortical atrophy."
