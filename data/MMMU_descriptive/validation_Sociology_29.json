The diagram consists of four main components arranged in a circular flow:\n\n1. **Society**: This is positioned at the top left of the circle.\n2. **Symbols**: This is positioned at the top right of the circle.\n3. **Establish meanings**: This is positioned at the bottom right of the circle.\n4. **Develop their views**: This is positioned at the bottom left of the circle.\n\nArrows connect these components in a clockwise direction, indicating a cyclical process:\n- From **Society** to **Symbols**, suggesting that society influences the creation or use of symbols.\n- From **Symbols** to **Establish meanings**, indicating that symbols help establish meanings.\n- From **Establish meanings** to **Develop their views**, showing that established meanings contribute to the development of individual or collective views.\n- From **Develop their views** back to **Communicate with each other**, implying that developed views influence how individuals communicate with each other.\n- Finally, from **Communicate with each other** back to **Society**, completing the cycle, suggesting that communication within society reinforces societal norms and structures.\n\nThis diagram illustrates how symbolic interactionism operates through a continuous process of social interaction, symbol use, meaning establishment, view development, and communication."
