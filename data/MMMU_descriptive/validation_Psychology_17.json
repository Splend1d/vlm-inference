    "options": "['<image 1>', '<image 2>', '<image 3>', '<image 4>', '<image 5>']",
    "id": "validation_Psychology_17",
    "description": "The image consists of five different graphs labeled A through E, each representing the relationship between arousal and performance. \n\n- Graph A shows a bell-shaped curve where performance increases with arousal up to a certain point and then decreases.\n- Graph B depicts a curve that rises sharply at first and then plateaus, indicating that performance increases rapidly with arousal initially but levels off.\n- Graph C illustrates a straight line with a positive slope, suggesting that performance consistently increases as arousal increases.\n- Graph D presents an inverted U-shaped curve, where performance decreases with arousal up to a certain point and then increases.\n- Graph E displays a straight line with a negative slope, indicating that performance decreases as arousal increases.\n\nThese graphs represent various hypothetical relationships between arousal and performance, each with a distinct pattern."
