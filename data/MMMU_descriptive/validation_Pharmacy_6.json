    "description": "The image shows a chemical equation representing a redox reaction:\n\n\\[ \\text{CO}_2 + 8\\text{H}^+ + 8e^- \\longrightarrow \\text{CH}_4 + 2\\text{H}_2\\text{O} \\]\n\nThis equation describes the reduction of carbon dioxide (CO\u2082) to methane (CH\u2084) in the presence of protons (H\u207a) and electrons (e\u207b), resulting in the formation of water (H\u2082O). This type of reaction is characteristic of certain metabolic processes in microorganisms, particularly those involved in methanogenesis. Methanogens are archaea that produce methane as a byproduct of their metabolism, often under anaerobic conditions."
