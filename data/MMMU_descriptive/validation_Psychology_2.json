    "question": "To investigate people's ability to divide their attention between two different tasks, college students were asked to listen to a passage of expository prose and at the same time to inspect a set of photographs, unrelated to the passage, that were projected one by one at a rapid rate. At the end of the dual-task presentation, the students were tested both for their memory of the passage and their memory of the photographs. To establish a baseline for this dual-task condition, the same students also were tested for their memory when each of the component tasks was presented alone. The following graph shows the results. <image 1> In a study of the effectiveness of divided attention, it is most important that the experimental design include",
    "options": "['a counterbalance of the order in which participants are tested in the baseline and dual-task conditions', 'a consistent order in which participants are tested in the baseline and dual-task conditions', 'an equal number of men and women as participants', 'verification that participants believe themselves capable of dividing attention']",

    "description": "The image is a bar graph titled \"Percent Correct\" with the x-axis labeled \"Type of Memory\" and the y-axis labeled \"Percent Correct.\" There are two types of memory represented: \"Prose\" and \"Photograph.\" For each type of memory, there are two bars representing different conditions:\n\n1. Dual-task condition (white bar)\n2. Baseline (single-task) condition (hatched bar)\n\nFor the \"Prose\" type of memory:\n- The dual-task condition has a bar reaching approximately 25%.\n- The baseline (single-task) condition has a bar reaching approximately 20%.\n\nFor the \"Photograph\" type of memory:\n- The dual-task condition has a bar reaching approximately 60%.\n- The baseline (single-task) condition has a bar reaching approximately 75%.\n\nThe graph indicates that memory performance is lower in the dual-task condition compared to the baseline condition for both prose and photographs, but the difference is more pronounced for photographs."
