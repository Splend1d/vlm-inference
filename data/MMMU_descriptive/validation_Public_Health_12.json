    "description": "The image shows a table with data related to a screening test for cervical cancer. The table is divided into two main columns: \"Screening test\" and \"Total.\" Under the \"Screening test\" column, there are two rows labeled \"positive\" and \"negative.\" Under the \"Total\" column, there are two rows labeled \"Cervical cancer patients\" and \"Non-cervical cancer patients.\"\n\nThe data in the table is as follows:\n\n- In the \"positive\" row under \"Cervical cancer patients,\" there are 800 patients.\n- In the \"positive\" row under \"Non-cervical cancer patients,\" there are 200 patients.\n- In the \"negative\" row under \"Cervical cancer patients,\" there are 200 patients.\n- In the \"negative\" row under \"Non-cervical cancer patients,\" there are 800 patients.\n- The total number of cervical cancer patients is 1000.\n- The total number of non-cervical cancer patients is 1000.\n\nThe sensitivity of the test can be calculated using the formula:\n\\[ \\text{Sensitivity} = \\frac{\\text{True Positives}}{\\text{True Positives} + \\text{False Negatives}} \\]\n\nIn this case, the true positives are the number of cervical cancer patients who tested positive (800), and the false negatives are the number of cervical cancer patients who tested negative (200).\n\nUsing the formula:\n\\[ \\text{Sensitivity} = \\frac{800}{800 + 200} = \\frac{800}{1000} = 0.8 \\]\n\nTherefore, the sensitivity of the test is 80%."
