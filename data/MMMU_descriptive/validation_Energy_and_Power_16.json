    "description": "The image depicts a refrigeration cycle for a residential heat pump using Refrigerant-134a. The cycle consists of four main components: the condenser, the expansion valve, the evaporator, and the compressor.\n\n1. **Condenser**: The refrigerant enters the condenser at 800 kPa and 35\u00b0C. It releases heat (\\(\\dot{Q}_H\\)) to the surroundings and condenses into a saturated liquid at 800 kPa.\n\n2. **Expansion Valve**: The refrigerant then passes through an expansion valve, where it undergoes a pressure drop and becomes a two-phase mixture (liquid and vapor) at a lower pressure.\n\n3. **Evaporator**: The refrigerant enters the evaporator as a two-phase mixture and absorbs heat (\\(\\dot{Q}_L\\)) from the surroundings, evaporating into a vapor.\n\n4. **Compressor**: The vaporized refrigerant is compressed by the compressor, which requires work input (\\(\\dot{W}_{in}\\)). The compressed refrigerant then returns to the condenser to complete the cycle.\n\nThe given information includes:\n- The refrigerant enters the condenser at 800 kPa and 35\u00b0C.\n- The refrigerant leaves the condenser as a saturated liquid at 800 kPa.\n- The mass flow rate of the refrigerant is 0.018 kg/s.\n- The compressor consumes 1.2 kW of power.\n\nBased on this description, the question asks to determine the COP (Coefficient of Performance) of the heat pump."
