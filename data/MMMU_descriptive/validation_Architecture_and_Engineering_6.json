    "question": "Two consecutive photographs were taken with a camera of focal length 200 mm mounted on an airplane flying at a height of 1500 m. The overlap was exactly 60% and the size of prints was 250 mm 250 mm. The flying height was same in case of both the exposures and the flight was balanced so that there was no drift. The ground was flat and was 250 m above the mean sea level. Determine the scale of the photograph and the length of the air base.<image 1>",
    "options": "['The scale of the photographs is 1 cm = 62.5 m;Air base = 625 m', 'The scale of the photographs is 1 cm = 68.5 m;Air base = 625 m', 'The scale of the photographs is 1 cm = 66.5 m;Air base = 625 m', 'The scale of the photographs is 1 cm = 64.5 m;Air base = 625 m']",

    "description": "The image depicts two consecutive photographs taken from an airplane flying at a constant height of 1500 meters above a flat ground that is 250 meters above sea level. The photographs have an overlap of exactly 60%, meaning that the second photograph covers 60% of the area covered by the first photograph. The size of each print is 250 mm x 250 mm.\n\nThe diagram shows two triangles representing the field of view of the camera for each photograph. The base of each triangle represents the \"air base,\" which is the distance on the ground covered by each photograph. The diagram indicates that the total length covered by both photographs combined is labeled as \\( L \\), with the first photograph covering 0.4L and the second photograph covering 0.6L. This implies that the air base for each photograph is equal to 0.4L and 0.6L, respectively.\n\nGiven this information, we can determine the scale of the photographs and the length of the air base."
