    "description": "The image shows two steel plates attached by parallel-loaded fillet welds. The plates are connected using E60 series welding rods. The welds are 3 inches long each, and there are two such welds. The yield strength (Sy) of the steel plates is 50 ksi (kilopounds per square inch). The diameter of the welding rods is 0.375 inches. A safety factor (SF) of 3 is applied to ensure structural integrity."
