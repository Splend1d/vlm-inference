    "description": "The image shows an electrocardiogram (ECG) tracing. The ECG paper has a grid pattern with small squares and larger squares. The tracing consists of a series of regular waves and complexes. Each complex includes P waves, QRS complexes, and T waves. The P waves appear before each QRS complex, indicating atrial depolarization. The QRS complexes are narrow and upright, suggesting normal ventricular depolarization. The T waves follow the QRS complexes and are also upright. There are no irregularities or additional waves between the complexes that would suggest premature atrial contractions (PACs) or premature ventricular contractions (PVCs). The rhythm appears to be regular and consistent throughout the tracing."
