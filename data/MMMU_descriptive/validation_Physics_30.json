    "description": "The image shows a standing wave pattern established in a string. The string is fixed at both ends, and there are three complete wavelengths (loops) visible along the length of the string. The total length of the string is 6 meters. Each loop has a peak-to-peak distance of 2 meters, indicating the wavelength of the component traveling waves."
