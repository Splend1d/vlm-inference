    "question": "Compare the scales of photography for the area recorded and the strip widths given by cameras A and B at the same flying heights.<image 1>How many photographs would be taken by the camera A in covering a strip 16 km long at a flying height of 1350 m? The longitudinal overlap is 60%.",

    "description": "The image is a table comparing two cameras, labeled Camera A and Camera B. The table has three columns: Format, Focal length, and the respective values for each camera.\n\n- **Camera A**:\n  - Format: 180 mm \u00d7 180 mm\n  - Focal length: 210 mm\n\n- **Camera B**:\n  - Format: 230 mm \u00d7 230 mm\n  - Focal length: 150 mm\n\nThis information is used to compare the scales of photography for the area recorded and the strip widths given by cameras A and B at the same flying heights."
