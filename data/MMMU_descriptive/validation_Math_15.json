    "description": "The image depicts a right-angled triangle with a hypotenuse labeled as 25 feet. The triangle represents a ladder leaning against a vertical wall. The horizontal leg of the triangle is labeled \\( x \\), representing the distance from the bottom of the ladder to the base of the wall. The vertical leg of the triangle is labeled \\( y \\), representing the height of the top of the ladder from the ground. The right angle is located at the bottom left corner of the triangle, indicating that the ladder forms a right angle with the ground and the wall."
