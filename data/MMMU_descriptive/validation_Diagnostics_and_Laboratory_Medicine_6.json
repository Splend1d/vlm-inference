    "question": "An English Bulldog is undergoing thoracic radiographs to look for megaesophagus. The following right lateral radiograph is obtained. What are your thoughts? <image 1>",
    "options": "['This dog has megaesophagus, and an upright feeding chair should be recommended.', 'This dog has extra mediastinal fat, and megaesophagus is not identified.', 'This dog has pulmonary edema in the cranial lung lobes, likely secondary to aspiration pneumonia.', 'This dog has a large volume pleural effusion, and a thoracentesis should be performed immediately.']",

    "description": "The image is a right lateral thoracic radiograph of an English Bulldog. The radiograph shows the thoracic cavity with the spine visible along the top edge. The heart silhouette is prominent, and there is a noticeable widening of the esophageal area, which appears dilated and filled with gas and fluid. The lungs appear to have some areas of increased opacity, suggesting possible fluid accumulation or other abnormalities. There is no evidence of a large volume pleural effusion, as the lung fields are not completely obscured. The overall appearance suggests the presence of megaesophagus, where the esophagus is abnormally enlarged."
