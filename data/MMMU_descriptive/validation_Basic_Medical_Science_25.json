    "question": "Where do the axons of this nucleus terminate? <image 1> ",

    "description": "The image shows a histological section of a brainstem structure, specifically highlighting the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve (DMV). This nucleus is located in the medulla oblongata and is part of the autonomic nervous system. The DMV is responsible for sending parasympathetic signals to various organs and tissues in the body.\n\nGiven the context of the question, which asks about the termination of the axons from this nucleus, we can infer that the correct answer would involve the postganglionic parasympathetic cell bodies, as the DMV sends preganglionic fibers to these cells, which then innervate smooth muscles of viscera and other target organs. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Postganglionic parasympathetic cell bodies."
