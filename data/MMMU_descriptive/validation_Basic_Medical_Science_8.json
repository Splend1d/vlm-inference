    "description": "The image shows a cross-sectional view of the brain, specifically focusing on the visual cortex. The tissue appears to be stained to highlight different layers and structures. There is a prominent yellow arrow pointing to a specific line or band within the tissue. This line is located in layer IV of the visual cortex, which is known to receive input from the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus. The LGN is a relay station for visual information from the retina to the primary visual cortex."
