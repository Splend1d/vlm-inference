    "description": "The image consists of three sections:\n\n1. **Data Table:**\n   - The table has three columns labeled [A] (M), [B] (M), and Rate (M/s).\n   - The rows contain the following data:\n     - Row 1: [A] = 0.08 M, [B] = 0.06 M, Rate = 0.012 M/s\n     - Row 2: [A] = 0.08 M, [B] = 0.03 M, Rate = 0.006 M/s\n     - Row 3: [A] = 0.04 M, [B] = 0.06 M, Rate = 0.003 M/s\n\n2. **Equation for Reactant A:**\n   - The equation is \\(\\frac{[A]_1}{[A]_3} = \\frac{R_1}{R_3}\\)\n   - Substituting the values from the table:\n     - \\(\\frac{0.08}{0.04} = \\frac{0.012}{0.003}\\)\n     - Simplifying both sides gives \\(2 = 4\\)\n\n3. **Equation for Reactant B:**\n   - The equation is \\(\\frac{[B]_1}{[B]_2} = \\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\)\n   - Substituting the values from the table:\n     - \\(\\frac{0.06}{0.03} = \\frac{0.012}{0.006}\\)\n     - Simplifying both sides gives \\(2 = 2\\)\n\nBased on these calculations, the order with respect to reactant A is 2, and the order with respect to reactant B is 1. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**A. 2,1**"
