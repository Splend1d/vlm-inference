    "description": "The image shows a close-up of a single leaf from a globe artichoke plant. The leaf has a prominent central vein running vertically down its center, with several smaller veins branching off to the sides. The leaf is predominantly green but has noticeable blemishes. One significant blemish is located near the top left corner of the leaf, where the tissue appears discolored with shades of brown and yellow. This blemished area seems to have an irregular shape and does not follow the pattern of the veins. The surrounding soil is visible in the background, indicating that the leaf is lying on the ground."
