    "question": "There is a square five pile cap as shown in Figures 4-36. Known conditions: cushion cap thickness of 1.2m, effective height h0=1050mm, using C25 concrete (tensile strength design value ft=1.27MPa); Pile section size 0.4m * 04m; Column section size 0.6m * 0.6m. Calculate the punching shear bearing capacity Fl of the cushion cap as () kN.<image 1>",

    "description": "The image depicts a square five-pile cap structure with specific dimensions and annotations. The top view shows a square layout with four piles positioned at the corners and one central pile. The overall dimensions of the square are 1500 mm x 1500 mm. Each pile has a section size of 400 mm x 400 mm, as indicated by the smaller squares within the larger square outline. \n\nThe column section, which is centrally located within the square, measures 600 mm x 600 mm. The distance from the center of the column to the center of each corner pile is 450 mm, while the distance from the center of the column to the center of the central pile is 0 mm since it is directly aligned with the column.\n\nThe side view of the pile cap shows its thickness, denoted as 'h', which is given as 1200 mm. The effective height 'h0' is specified as 1050 mm. A dashed line represents the critical section for punching shear, which is located at a distance 'x' from the face of the column. The value of 'x' is calculated as 0.75 times the column width minus 0.2 times the pile diameter minus 0.3 times the pile diameter, resulting in 250 mm.\n\nThe material used for the pile cap is C25 concrete, with a tensile strength design value 'ft' of 1.27 MPa. The goal is to calculate the punching shear bearing capacity 'Fl' of the cushion cap based on these provided dimensions and material properties."
