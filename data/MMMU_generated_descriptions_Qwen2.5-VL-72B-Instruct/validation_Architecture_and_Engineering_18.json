    "description": "The image contains a table with data related to a traverse survey. The table lists the changes in northing (\u0394N) and easting (\u0394E) for various lines within the traverse. The lines listed are AB, BC, CD, DE, and EF. Here's the detailed breakdown:\n\n- **Line AB:**\n  - \u0394N = -1190.0 meters\n  - \u0394E = 0 meters\n\n- **Line BC:**\n  - \u0394N = -565.3 meters\n  - \u0394E = 736.4 meters\n\n- **Line CD:**\n  - \u0394N = 590.5 meters\n  - \u0394E = 796.8 meters\n\n- **Line DE:**\n  - \u0394N = 606.9 meters\n  - \u0394E = -468.0 meters\n\n- **Line EF:**\n  - \u0394N = 1017.2 meters\n  - \u0394E = 370.4 meters\n\nThis information represents the differences in northing and easting between consecutive points along the traverse. The question involves using this data, along with the given bearing and length of line FG, to determine the length and bearing of line GA. The reference meridian is specified as line BA."
