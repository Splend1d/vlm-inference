    "description": "The image displays a table labeled \"Table 13.4,\" which contains three columns and four rows of data. The columns are labeled as follows:\n\n- The first column is labeled \"i\" and lists the indices: 0, 1, 2, and 3.\n- The second column is labeled \"$b_i$\" and lists the corresponding values: 8, 2.2, -0.72, and 0.005.\n- The third column is labeled \"$S_{b_i}$\" and lists the standard errors: 1.6, 0.24, 0.32, and 0.002.\n\nThe specific row for index \"i = 2\" shows:\n- $b_2$ = -0.72\n- $S_{b_2}$ = 0.32\n\nThis information is relevant for calculating the confidence interval for $b_2$. The confidence interval formula involves adding and subtracting a product of a student's t-value and the standard error ($S_{b_2}$). Therefore, the confidence interval for $b_2$ would be calculated as $-0.72 \\pm (\\text{t-value}) \\times 0.32$."
