    "question": "Researchers studying vision use various methods to investigate human perceptual experience. Research on spectral sensitivity of the rod receptors (scattered throughout the retina) and cone visual receptors (mainly concentrated in the fovea area of the retina) highlights the relationship between perception and physiology. Signal detection methods have been used to measure the differences in how perception adjusts to low-light environments. Participant responses can be plotted based on sensitivity versus length of time in the dark. The dark adaptation curve can be plotted showing how rods and cones differ in their sensitivity to light over time. The following graph shows a plot of three calculated dark adaptation curves. <image 1> Which of the following statements is true?",
    "options": "['Rods are responsible for color vision, which explains color sensitivity under low-light conditions.', 'Cones are responsible for color vision, which explains greater color sensitivity under low-light conditions.', 'Rods do not respond preferentially to wavelengths in the light spectrum, which explains why colors are not detectable in low-light conditions.', 'Both rods and cones respond to specific colors in the light spectrum; loss of color vision in dark conditions is the result of fewer photons of light.']",

    "description": "The image is a graph titled \"Three dark adaptation curves,\" illustrating the changes in light sensitivity of the human eye's photoreceptors\u2014rods and cones\u2014as they adapt to darkness over time. The x-axis represents \"Time in dark (min),\" ranging from 0 to approximately 30 minutes, while the y-axis represents \"Light levels,\" with \"Low\" at the top and \"High\" at the bottom, indicating decreasing light sensitivity as one moves downward.\n\nThere are three distinct curves on the graph:\n\n1. **Rod Curve (dashed line labeled \"Rod\")**: This curve starts at a high level of light sensitivity when first entering darkness but rapidly decreases over time. It reaches its lowest point, labeled \"Maximum rod sensitivity,\" after about 20-30 minutes in the dark. This indicates that rods become highly sensitive to low light levels after extended periods in darkness.\n\n2. **Cone Curve (dashed line labeled \"Cone\")**: This curve also begins at a high level of light sensitivity but drops more gradually compared to the rod curve. It plateaus at a higher level than the rod curve, labeled \"Maximum cone sensitivity.\" This plateau occurs earlier, around 5-10 minutes into darkness, suggesting that cones adapt quickly to low light but maintain a higher sensitivity threshold compared to rods.\n\n3. **Combined Human Light Sensitivity Curve (solid line)**: This curve represents the overall light sensitivity of the human eye, incorporating both rod and cone contributions. It follows the cone curve initially, then transitions to follow the rod curve after the \"Rod-cone break\" point, which occurs around 10 minutes in the dark. This transition reflects the shift from cone-dominated vision to rod-dominated vision as the eye adapts to very low light levels.\n\nKey points on the graph include:\n- \"Light-adapted sensitivity\": A horizontal line near the top, indicating the initial high sensitivity before entering darkness.\n- \"Rod-cone break\": The point where the combined human light sensitivity shifts from cone dominance to rod dominance.\n- \"Dark-adapted sensitivity\": A horizontal line near the bottom, indicating the final low sensitivity achieved after full adaptation to darkness.\n\nThe caption below the graph states: \"Three dark adaptation curves. Both dashed lines indicate receptor-specific curves, while the solid line is a plot of human light sensitivity with both receptor types included.\"\n\nThis graph visually demonstrates that rods are primarily responsible for vision in low-light conditions, while cones are active in brighter conditions and are responsible for color vision. The transition from cone to rod dominance during dark adaptation explains why color perception diminishes in low-light environments."
