    "question": "<image 1> <image 2> Which of the following Acts of Parliament was passed in direct response to the events of the Boston Tea Party?",

    "description": "The first image is a historical political cartoon titled \"Join, or Die,\" created by Benjamin Franklin in 1754. The image depicts a segmented snake with each segment labeled with abbreviations for the colonies at the time: N.E., N.Y., N.J., P., M., V., N.C., S.C. The snake is broken into pieces, symbolizing disunity among the colonies. Below the snake, the text reads \"JOIN, or DIE,\" emphasizing the need for colonial unity.\n\nThe second image contains a famous speech excerpt by Patrick Henry delivered at the Second Virginia Convention in 1775. The speech passionately argues against complacency and advocates for action in the face of impending conflict. Key phrases include \"The war is actually begun!\" and \"give me liberty or give me death.\" This speech reflects the growing tensions and the call for independence leading up to the American Revolution.\n\nNeither image directly references the Boston Tea Party or any specific acts of Parliament. However, the context provided by these images suggests a timeline of increasing tension between the colonies and Britain, culminating in the events surrounding the American Revolution. The Boston Tea Party occurred in 1773, and in response, Parliament passed the Coercive Acts in 1774 to punish the colony of Massachusetts. Therefore, based on the historical context implied by the images, the correct answer to the question is:\n\nA. Coercive Acts"
