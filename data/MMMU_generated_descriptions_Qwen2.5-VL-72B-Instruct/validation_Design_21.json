    "description": "The image shows a person standing in front of a white door. They are wearing a plaid shirt in shades of gray and black, paired with dark blue jeans. The outfit is accessorized with a bright red scarf wrapped around their neck and a belt cinching the waist. They also have on knee-high gray suede boots. The overall look features neutral tones like gray, black, and white, with red serving as a bold accent color. The floor beneath them appears to be beige tiles. The combination of neutral colors with one vibrant accent color suggests a specific type of color scheme."
