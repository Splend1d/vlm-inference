    "question": "Email #1: E-mail from Vice President of E.A.S.Y. Manufacturing to Legislative Consultant and Staff Researcher: The results of the last election are a concern for us. The candidates we supported were defeated in more than two-thirds of the races we followed. The result is a harder battle to get policies that benefit our interests through the legislature, but it's also a budget issue. We can't continue throwing money at races we can't win, no matter how agreeable the candidate's stand on our issues may be. The fact that they share our viewpoints doesn't help if they can't get elected. How can we determine where it makes sense to invest? E-mail #2: E-mail from Legislative Consultant to Vice President of E.A.S.Y. Manufacturing and Staff Researcher: The demographic breakdown of elections where we supported the unsuccessful candidate can tell us a great deal. We've won only in one demographic, and our margin there is smaller than the margins by which we lost the others. <image 1> E-mail #3: E-mail from Staff Researcher to Vice President of E.A.S.Y. Manufacturing and Legislative Consultant: The demographic groups in which we lost are on track to become a majority of the U.S. electorate this century, and they vote. Right now, they make up 37% of the overall population and 28% of voters in the last election. By midcentury, we can expect the Hispanic population to rise from 17% to about 29% of the U.S. population, and Asian-Americans, now about 5%, will be about 9%. Our one successful demographic is the one whose share is declining. Now 63% of the population, non-Hispanic whites will be less than half of the population by 2050. Consider the following statement. Does the information in the three sources support the inference as stated? Statement: E.A.S.Y. Manufacturing supported candidates whose policy positions did not appeal to ethnic minorities.",

    "description": "The image is a bar chart comparing voter support across different racial/ethnic demographics for \"Opponents\" and \"Our candidates.\" The chart includes four categories of voters:\n\n1. **White voters** (represented by light gray bars)\n2. **African-American voters** (represented by medium gray bars)\n3. **Hispanic voters** (represented by dark gray bars)\n4. **Other (e.g., Asian, Pacific Islander)** (represented by black bars)\n\n### Data for Opponents:\n- **White voters:** Approximately 40% support.\n- **African-American voters:** Approximately 90% support.\n- **Hispanic voters:** Approximately 70% support.\n- **Other (e.g., Asian, Pacific Islander):** Approximately 70% support.\n\n### Data for Our Candidates:\n- **White voters:** Approximately 60% support.\n- **African-American voters:** Approximately 5% support.\n- **Hispanic voters:** Approximately 25% support.\n- **Other (e.g., Asian, Pacific Islander):** Approximately 25% support.\n\nThe chart shows that \"Our candidates\" received significantly lower support from African-American, Hispanic, and Other voters compared to the \"Opponents,\" while receiving higher support from White voters. This suggests that the candidates supported by E.A.S.Y. Manufacturing were less appealing to ethnic minority groups."
