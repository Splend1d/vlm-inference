    "description": "The image illustrates a genetic engineering process involving bacterial cells and human cells. The process begins with a bacterial cell containing a plasmid, which is a small circular DNA molecule. The plasmid is extracted from the bacterial cell (step 1). Meanwhile, a gene for human growth hormone is isolated from a human cell (step 2) and then cut into smaller fragments using restriction enzymes (step 3).\n\nNext, the cut gene fragment is inserted into the previously extracted plasmid (step 4), creating a recombinant plasmid. This recombinant plasmid is then reintroduced into a bacterial cell (step 5). Once inside the bacterial cell, the recombinant plasmid replicates along with the bacterial cell's DNA during cell division (step 6). As the bacteria multiply, they produce large quantities of the human growth hormone encoded by the inserted gene (step 7).\n\nThis entire process is an example of **recombinant DNA technology**, specifically used to produce human proteins like growth hormones using bacterial cells as hosts."
