    "question": "45 year old Mexican rancher with 3 month history of cognitive problems. The most likely etiology of this process is: <image 1>",
    "options": "['Cysticercosis', 'Amebic encephalitis', 'Herpes Simplex encephalitis', 'Trypanosomiasis', 'Coccidiodal meningitis']",

    "description": "The image shows a histological section stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). The section appears to depict brain tissue. There is a prominent lesion visible in the center-right portion of the image. This lesion has a well-defined, rounded shape with a solid, homogenous appearance, suggesting it could be a cyst or a mass. Surrounding the lesion, there is evidence of inflammation, indicated by the presence of infiltrating cells and possibly edema. The surrounding brain tissue shows some distortion and compression due to the presence of the lesion. The lesion's morphology, including its size, shape, and the inflammatory response around it, is consistent with a parasitic cyst, particularly one caused by *Taenia solium*, which is known to cause cysticercosis. The other options listed do not typically present with this specific histological appearance. \n\nBased on the description provided, the most likely etiology of the process depicted in the image is:\n\nA. Cysticercosis"
