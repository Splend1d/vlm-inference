    "description": "The image is a table titled \"Mineral Characteristics,\" which lists four minerals along with their respective hardness, specific gravity, and luster/color. The minerals and their characteristics are as follows:\n\n1. **Feldspar**:\n   - Hardness: 6\u20136.5\n   - Specific Gravity: 2.5\u20132.8\n   - Luster/Color: nonmetallic/colorless or white\n\n2. **Fluorite**:\n   - Hardness: 4\n   - Specific Gravity: 3\u20133.3\n   - Luster/Color: nonmetallic/yellow, blue, purple, rose, green, or brown\n\n3. **Galena**:\n   - Hardness: 2.5\u20132.75\n   - Specific Gravity: 7.4\u20137.6\n   - Luster/Color: metallic/grayish black\n\n4. **Quartz**:\n   - Hardness: 7\n   - Specific Gravity: 2.65\n   - Luster/Color: nonmetallic/colorless in pure form\n\nThe hardness values provided for each mineral indicate how resistant they are to scratching. The higher the hardness value, the harder the mineral."
