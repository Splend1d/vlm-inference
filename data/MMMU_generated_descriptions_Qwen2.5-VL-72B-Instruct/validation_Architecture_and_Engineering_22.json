    "description": "The image presents a table with data related to a closed compass traverse. The table lists five lines (AB, BC, CD, DE, EA) along with their corresponding Fore Bearing (F.B.) and Back Bearing (B.B.) values. Here's the detailed breakdown:\n\n### Lines and Bearings:\n- **Line AB:**\n  - F.B.: 142\u00b030'\n  - B.B.: 322\u00b030'\n\n- **Line BC:**\n  - F.B.: 223\u00b015'\n  - B.B.: 44\u00b015'\n\n- **Line CD:**\n  - F.B.: 287\u00b000'\n  - B.B.: 107\u00b045'\n\n- **Line DE:**\n  - F.B.: 12\u00b045'\n  - B.B.: 193\u00b015'\n\n- **Line EA:**\n  - F.B.: 60\u00b000'\n  - B.B.: 239\u00b000'\n\n### Observations:\n- The difference between the F.B. and B.B. for each line should ideally be 180\u00b0, which is a standard check for consistency in compass traverses.\n- For example, for Line AB: \n  - Difference = 322\u00b030' - 142\u00b030' = 180\u00b0\n- Similarly, this holds true for all other lines.\n\n### Question Context:\nThe question asks for the computation of interior angles at points A, B, C, D, and E using these bearings and then correcting them for observational errors. The options provided give different sets of computed angles.\n\n### Answer Options:\nA. \u2220A = 260\u00b030', \u2220B = 260\u00b045', \u2220C = 242\u00b045', \u2220D = 265\u00b000', \u2220E = 226\u00b045'\nB. \u2220A = 263\u00b045', \u2220B = 261\u00b000', \u2220C = 243\u00b000', \u2220D = 265\u00b015', \u2220E = 227\u00b000'\nC. \u2220A = 263\u00b030', \u2220B = 260\u00b045', \u2220C = 242\u00b045', \u2220D = 265\u00b000', \u2220E = 226\u00b045'\nD. \u2220A = 261\u00b030', \u2220B = 260\u00b045', \u2220C = 242\u00b045', \u2220D = 265\u00b000', \u2220E = 226\u00b045'\n\nThis description provides all necessary details from the image to compute and verify the angles as per the given options."
