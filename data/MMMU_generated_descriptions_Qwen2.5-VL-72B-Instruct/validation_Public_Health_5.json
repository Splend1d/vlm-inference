    "description": "The table provided details the cost-benefit analysis for Hepatitis B vaccination across three different endemic areas: High, Middle, and Low. The data is presented in RMB (Renminbi) units of 10,000. Here's a breakdown:\n\n- **High Endemic Area**:\n  - Total cost of Hepatitis B vaccination: 18 (RMB 10,000)\n  - Direct benefits: 286 (RMB 10,000)\n  - Indirect benefits: 683 (RMB 10,000)\n\n- **Middle Endemic Area**:\n  - Total cost of Hepatitis B vaccination: 22 (RMB 10,000)\n  - Direct benefits: 345 (RMB 10,000)\n  - Indirect benefits: 1571 (RMB 10,000)\n\n- **Low Endemic Area**:\n  - Total cost of Hepatitis B vaccination: 42 (RMB 10,000)\n  - Direct benefits: 562 (RMB 10,000)\n  - Indirect benefits: 1852 (RMB 10,000)\n\nTo calculate the Benefit-Cost Ratio (BCR), you sum the direct and indirect benefits and divide by the total cost. For the Low Endemic Area:\n\n\\[ \\text{BCR} = \\frac{\\text{Direct benefits} + \\text{Indirect benefits}}{\\text{Total cost}} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{BCR} = \\frac{562 + 1852}{42} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{BCR} = \\frac{2414}{42} \\approx 57.48 \\]\n\nThus, the BCR in the Low Endemic Area is approximately 57.48."
