    "question": "The apparatus in <image 1> is used for SDSPAGE (polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis). Which letter indicates the anode?",
    "options": "['A', 'B', 'Neither']",

    "description": "The image depicts a schematic diagram of a gel electrophoresis setup, specifically for SDS-PAGE (sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis). The diagram includes several labeled components:\n\n- **Well**: These are small indentations at the top of the gel where samples are loaded.\n- **Samples**: Represented by purple blocks within the wells, indicating where the protein samples are placed.\n- **Larger fragments** and **Smaller fragments**: These labels show the direction in which the protein fragments migrate through the gel during electrophoresis. Larger fragments remain closer to the wells, while smaller fragments travel further down the gel.\n- **Buffer**: This surrounds the gel and facilitates the movement of charged particles.\n- **Gel**: The medium through which the protein fragments migrate, shown as a blue rectangular block.\n- **Plastic frame**: The structure holding the gel in place.\n  \nTwo letters, **A** and **B**, are also present in the diagram:\n- **A** is located near the top of the gel, close to the wells where the samples are loaded.\n- **B** is positioned at the bottom of the gel, opposite to the wells.\n\nIn gel electrophoresis, the anode is typically located at the bottom of the gel, attracting negatively charged molecules like proteins that have been denatured with SDS. Therefore, the letter **B** indicates the anode."
