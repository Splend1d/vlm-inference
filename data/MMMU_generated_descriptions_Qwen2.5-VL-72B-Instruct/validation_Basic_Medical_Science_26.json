Inside the cell, there is a large central vacuole filled with a light blue substance. Surrounding the central vacuole are several other organelles, including a nucleus with a nucleolus, mitochondria, chloroplasts (green structures), endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and lysosomes. The presence of a cell wall and chloroplasts are notable features."
