    "description": "The image is a grid-based diagram labeled \"Figure 3.10,\" which represents the data structure of a line coverage. The grid has coordinates ranging from (0,0) at the bottom left corner to (10,10) at the top right corner. Various nodes are marked with numbers, and lines connect these nodes, forming a network.\n\nKey details relevant to the question:\n\n- Node 12 is located near the top-left section of the grid.\n- Node 12 is connected by two arcs:\n  - One arc connects it to node 11, which is directly to its left.\n  - Another arc connects it to node 3, which is below and slightly to the right.\n\nThus, there are **two arcs** connecting at node 12."
