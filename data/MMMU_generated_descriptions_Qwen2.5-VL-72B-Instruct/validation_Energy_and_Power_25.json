    "question": "A gas-turbine power plant operates on the simple Brayton cycle between the pressure limits of 100 and 1600 kPa.The working fluid is air, which enters the compressor at 40\u00b0C at a rate of 850 m^3/min and leaves the turbine at 650\u00b0C. Using variable specific heats for air and assuming a compressor isentropic efficiency of 85 percent and a turbine isentropic efficiency of 88 percent, determine (1) the net power output and (2) the back work ratio.<image 1>",

    "description": "The image depicts a schematic diagram of a gas-turbine power plant operating on the simple Brayton cycle. The components and their connections are as follows:\n\n1. **Compressor**: Air enters the compressor at state point 1 with a pressure of 100 kPa and a temperature of 40\u00b0C. After compression, the air exits the compressor at state point 2 with a pressure of 1.6 MPa (1600 kPa). The compressor is driven by the turbine via a shaft connection.\n\n2. **Combustion Chamber**: The compressed air from the compressor enters the combustion chamber at state point 2. Fuel is added in the combustion chamber, and the air-fuel mixture is combusted, resulting in high-temperature gases exiting the combustion chamber at state point 3.\n\n3. **Turbine**: The high-temperature gases from the combustion chamber enter the turbine at state point 3. The gases expand through the turbine, producing work, and exit the turbine at state point 4 with a temperature of 650\u00b0C. The turbine drives the compressor via the same shaft.\n\n4. **Net Work Output (\\( \\dot{W}_{net} \\))**: The net work output of the gas-turbine power plant is indicated as \\( \\dot{W}_{net} \\), which is the difference between the work produced by the turbine and the work consumed by the compressor.\n\nAdditional information provided in the image includes:\n- The air enters the compressor at a rate of 850 m\u00b3/min.\n- The compressor has an isentropic efficiency of 85%.\n- The turbine has an isentropic efficiency of 88%.\n\nThe question requires determining the net power output and the back work ratio using variable specific heats for air and the given efficiencies. The options provided for the answers are:\nA. (1) 6001 kW, (2) 0.436\nB. (1) 6181 kW, (2) 0.536\nC. (1) 6081 kW, (2) 0.536"
