    "description": "The image presents a table comparing two cameras, Camera A and Camera B, with respect to their format and focal length:\n\n- **Camera A**:\n  - Format: \\(180 \\text{ mm} \\times 180 \\text{ mm}\\)\n  - Focal length: \\(210 \\text{ mm}\\)\n\n- **Camera B**:\n  - Format: \\(230 \\text{ mm} \\times 230 \\text{ mm}\\)\n  - Focal length: \\(150 \\text{ mm}\\)\n\nThis information is essential for calculating the scale of photography, which involves using the format and focal length data to determine the ground coverage per photograph. The question asks about the number of photographs needed from Camera A to cover a 16 km strip at a flying height of 1350 m with a 60% longitudinal overlap. The provided options are rounded values between 34 and 38."
