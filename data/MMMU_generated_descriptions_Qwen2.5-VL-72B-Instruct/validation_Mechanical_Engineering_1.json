    "question": "From the A-A section in the following figure, select the correct section ().<image 1>",
    "options": "['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']",
    "id": "validation_Mechanical_Engineering_1",
    "description": "The image shows a cylindrical object with a central hole and a smaller protruding cylinder attached to one side. The main cylinder has a rectangular cross-section when viewed from the top, and the smaller cylinder is positioned at one end, extending outward. \n\nBelow this main view, there are four options labeled A, B, C, and D, each representing different interpretations of the A-A section through the object. \n\n- Option A shows a circular cross-section with a vertical line running through the center, indicating a cut through the central hole.\n- Option B shows a semicircular shape with a horizontal line across the middle, suggesting a cut that only goes halfway through the object.\n- Option C shows a semicircular shape with a vertical line through the center, which does not match the expected cross-section.\n- Option D shows a full circular cross-section with no lines, which would indicate no cut or an incorrect interpretation of the section.\n\nGiven the orientation and structure of the object, the correct section should show a circular cross-section with a vertical line through the center, matching the central hole's position. Therefore, the correct option is A."
