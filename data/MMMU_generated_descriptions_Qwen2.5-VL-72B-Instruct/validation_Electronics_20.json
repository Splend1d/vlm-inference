    "description": "The image depicts a simple electrical circuit consisting of a voltage source \\( v_C \\) connected in series with a capacitor \\( C \\). The voltage source \\( v_C \\) is labeled with a positive terminal on the left and a negative terminal on the right. The capacitor \\( C \\) has a capacitance value of \\( 10^{-5} \\) Farads (F), as indicated by the label next to it. The current flowing through the circuit is denoted by \\( i \\), which is shown with an arrow pointing downward through the capacitor.\n\nThe circuit is represented as follows:\n- A voltage source \\( v_C \\) is connected across the capacitor.\n- The voltage source \\( v_C \\) is given by the equation \\( v_C = \\sin(2\\pi T) \\).\n- The capacitor \\( C \\) has a capacitance of \\( 10^{-5} \\) F.\n- The current \\( i \\) flows through the capacitor.\n\nTo find the expression for the current \\( i \\), we use the relationship between the voltage across a capacitor and the current through it, which is given by:\n\n\\[ i = C \\frac{dv_C}{dt} \\]\n\nGiven \\( v_C = \\sin(2\\pi T) \\), we need to differentiate \\( v_C \\) with respect to time \\( t \\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{dv_C}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}[\\sin(2\\pi T)] = 2\\pi \\cos(2\\pi T) \\]\n\nSubstituting this into the equation for the current:\n\n\\[ i = C \\cdot 2\\pi \\cos(2\\pi T) \\]\n\\[ i = 10^{-5} \\cdot 2\\pi \\cos(2\\pi T) \\]\n\\[ i = 2\\pi \\times 10^{-5} \\cos(2\\pi T) \\]\n\nTo find the current \\( i \\) at \\( t = 0 \\):\n\n\\[ i = 2\\pi \\times 10^{-5} \\cos(2\\pi \\cdot 0) \\]\n\\[ i = 2\\pi \\times 10^{-5} \\cos(0) \\]\n\\[ i = 2\\pi \\times 10^{-5} \\times 1 \\]\n\\[ i = 2\\pi \\times 10^{-5} \\]\n\nThus, the current \\( i \\) at \\( t = 0 \\) is \\( 2\\pi \\times 10^{-5} \\) Amperes.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. \\( 2\\pi \\times 10^{-5} \\) A"
