This includes AA2 ($2,500) and AA3 ($0). Therefore, WIP = $2,500.\n- **Finished Goods Inventory (FGI)**: Jobs completed but not sold by the end of January. This includes AA4 ($4,838). Therefore, FGI = $4,838.\n- **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**: Jobs sold by the end of January. There are no jobs sold in January.
