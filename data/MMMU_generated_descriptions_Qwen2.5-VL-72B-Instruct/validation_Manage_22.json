    "description": "The image is a cartoon representation of the HRM Roles model by David Ulrich (1997). The model is divided into four quadrants, each representing a different role of HR within an organization. The quadrants are arranged in a 2x2 matrix with two axes: \"Future/Strategic Focus\" on the vertical axis and \"Processes\" versus \"People\" on the horizontal axis.\n\n1. **Top Left Quadrant (Strategic Partner)**:\n   - This quadrant represents the role of HR as a Strategic Partner.\n   - The image shows a group of people sitting around a table, engaged in discussion. They appear to be in a meeting or planning session.\n   - This suggests that HR should be involved in strategic decision-making and aligning HR practices with the overall organizational strategy.\n\n2. **Top Right Quadrant (Change Agent)**:\n   - This quadrant represents the role of HR as a Change Agent.\n   - The image shows a person standing at a whiteboard, pointing at it while others look on. The person appears to be leading a presentation or explaining a concept.\n   - This indicates that HR should drive organizational change and have a long-term vision for the future.\n\n3. **Bottom Left Quadrant (Administration Expert)**:\n   - This quadrant represents the role of HR as an Administration Expert.\n   - The image shows a person sitting at a desk, working on paperwork or administrative tasks.\n   - This suggests that HR should manage day-to-day operations and infrastructure related to human resources.\n\n4. **Bottom Right Quadrant (Employee Champion)**:\n   - This quadrant represents the role of HR as an Employee Champion.\n   - The image shows a group of people holding signs that say \"STRIKE\" and \"FAIR PAY,\" while another person stands nearby, seemingly advocating for them.\n   - This indicates that HR should advocate for employees and optimize their value within the organization.\n\nBased on this description, the roles outlined by Ulrich emphasize strategic alignment, driving change, managing operations, and championing employees. Therefore, the option that does not align with these roles is:\n\n**A. Manage human resources operations and infrastructure**\n\nThis is because managing operations and infrastructure is already covered under the role of Administration Expert, which is part of the model. The other options (B, C, and D) are directly related to the roles depicted in the other quadrants of the model."
