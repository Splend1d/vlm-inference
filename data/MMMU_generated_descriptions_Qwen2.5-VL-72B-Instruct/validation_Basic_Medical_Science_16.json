    "description": "The image shows a histological section stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). The tissue appears to be a cross-section of skeletal muscle, as indicated by the presence of striated muscle fibers. These fibers are elongated and have a striped appearance due to the alternating light and dark bands characteristic of myofibrils. Interspersed among the muscle fibers are various other structures, including what appear to be nerve fibers and connective tissue. The nerve fibers are identified by their distinct morphology, which includes axons surrounded by myelin sheaths. Some of these axons seem to terminate in close proximity to the skeletal muscle fibers, suggesting a neuromuscular junction where the nerve impulses are transmitted to the muscle for contraction. The connective tissue forms a network around the muscle fibers and nerves, providing structural support. The overall organization suggests a close interaction between the nervous system and the muscular system at this level. \n\nBased on this description, the statement \"These cells, whose axons terminate directly on skeletal muscle fibers are also known as 'lower motor neurons'\" is **A. true**. The image supports the presence of lower motor neurons, as evidenced by the axons terminating near the skeletal muscle fibers."
