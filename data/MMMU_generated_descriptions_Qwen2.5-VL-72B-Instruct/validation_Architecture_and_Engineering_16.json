    "description": "The image presents a table with two columns: \"Speed (km/h)\" and \"Density (veh/km).\" The table lists six pairs of values:\n\n- Speed: 14.2 km/h, Density: 85 veh/km\n- Speed: 24.1 km/h, Density: 70 veh/km\n- Speed: 30.3 km/h, Density: 55 veh/km\n- Speed: 40.1 km/h, Density: 41 veh/km\n- Speed: 50.6 km/h, Density: 20 veh/km\n- Speed: 55.0 km/h, Density: 15 veh/km\n\nThese data points represent measurements taken using time-lapse photography on a highway. The task involves fitting this data to the Greenshields model, which describes the relationship between speed and density in traffic flow. The ultimate goal is to determine the highway's capacity, measured in vehicles per mile (veh/mi). The options for the capacity are:\nA. 1734 veh/mi  \nB. 1744 veh/mi  \nC. 1344 veh/mi  \n\nTo solve this problem, one would need to apply regression analysis to the provided data points, fit them to the Greenshields model equation, and then calculate the capacity based on the fitted parameters."
