    "description": "The image is an educational diagram categorizing different types of sedimentary rocks based on their subclass. The subclasses are Clastic, Chemically precipitated, and Organic. Each subclass has a list of rock types associated with it, along with images illustrating examples of these rocks.\n\n### Subclass: Clastic\n- **Description**: Composed of rock and/or mineral fragments.\n- **Rock Types**:\n  - Sandstone\n  - Siltstone\n  - Conglomerate\n  - Mudstone\n  - Claystone\n  - Shale\n- **Image**: A person hiking on a layered rock formation (Sandstone). Another image shows a close-up of a rock being held by a hand, which appears to have a fine-grained texture (Shale).\n\n### Subclass: Chemically precipitated\n- **Description**: Formed by chemical precipitation from seawater, sometimes with the help of micro- or macroorganisms.\n- **Rock Types**:\n  - Limestone\n  - Dolomite\n  - Chert\n  - Evaporites\n- **Image**: A coastal cliff scene showing white cliffs (Limestone).\n\n### Subclass: Organic\n- **Description**: Formed from organic material.\n- **Rock Types**:\n  - Coal\n  - Petroleum (mineral fuel)\n  - Natural gas (mineral fuel)\n- **Image**: An open-pit mine scene (Coal).\n\nThe image provides visual examples for each type of rock listed under its respective subclass but does not provide specific definitions or characteristics of each rock type beyond their subclass descriptions."
