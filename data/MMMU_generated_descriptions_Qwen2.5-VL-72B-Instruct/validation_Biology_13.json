    "question": "Blood glucose level is regulated by two antagonistic hormones, glucagon and insulin. The following graph shows the fluctuations in an individual's blood glucose level over a five hour period: <image 1>. From the information provided above and your knowledge of physiology, which of the following statements are appropriate? I. Normal homeostatic mechanisms maintain a glucose concentration of approximately 1 mg/ml. II. Glucagon is released at points A and C. III. The individual eats a meal at point D. IV. Insulin is being released at points B and E.",
    "options": "['I only', 'I and II only', 'I and IV only', 'I, II, and III only', 'II, III, and IV only']",

    "description": "The image is a line graph depicting the changes in blood glucose levels (measured in mg/ml) over a period of five hours. The x-axis represents time in hours, ranging from 0 to 5, while the y-axis represents blood glucose levels, ranging from 0.0 to 1.8 mg/ml. \n\nKey points on the graph are labeled as follows:\n\n- **Point A** is located at the beginning of the graph, where the blood glucose level starts at approximately 1.0 mg/ml.\n- **Point B** is the first peak, occurring around 1 hour, with a blood glucose level of about 1.6 mg/ml.\n- **Point C** is a trough after the first peak, occurring around 2 hours, with a blood glucose level of about 0.8 mg/ml.\n- **Point D** is another trough, occurring around 2.5 hours, with a blood glucose level of about 0.8 mg/ml.\n- **Point E** is a second peak, occurring around 3 hours, with a blood glucose level of about 1.2 mg/ml.\n\nThe graph shows fluctuations in blood glucose levels, with peaks and troughs indicating changes in hormonal regulation. The baseline or normal range for blood glucose appears to hover around 1.0 mg/ml, as seen at the start (Point A) and towards the end of the graph. The peaks (Points B and E) suggest times when insulin might be released to lower blood glucose levels, while the troughs (Points C and D) suggest times when glucagon might be released to raise blood glucose levels. There is no explicit indication of meals in the graph, but the peaks could imply food intake followed by insulin release."
