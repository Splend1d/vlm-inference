If the plates are rigid and the shear modulus of the rubber is G, determine the displacement of plate A if a vertical load P is applied to this plate.

    "description": "The image depicts a mechanical setup involving a shear spring composed of two rectangular blocks of rubber. These blocks have specific dimensions: a height \\( h \\), a width \\( b \\), and a thickness \\( a \\). The rubber blocks are bonded to three rigid plates. \n\n- The top plate (labeled as \"A\") is subjected to a vertical load \\( P \\) acting downward.\n- The middle plate is fixed in place and does not move.\n- The bottom plate is also fixed and does not move.\n\nWhen the load \\( P \\) is applied to the top plate, it causes a vertical displacement \\( \\delta \\) of the top plate relative to the middle plate. This displacement results in a shearing deformation within the rubber blocks.\n\nThe shearing deformation \\( \\gamma \\) (shear strain) is related to the displacement \\( \\delta \\) by the approximation \\( \\delta = a \\tan(\\gamma) \\approx a \\gamma \\), given that the displacement is small.\n\nThe shear modulus of the rubber material is denoted as \\( G \\).\n\nTo solve for the displacement \\( \\delta \\) of plate A under the load \\( P \\), we need to consider the shear stress \\( \\tau \\) developed in the rubber blocks due to the load \\( P \\). The shear stress \\( \\tau \\) is given by \\( \\tau = \\frac{P}{2ab} \\), where \\( 2ab \\) is the total area over which the shear force acts (since there are two rubber blocks).\n\nUsing Hooke's law for shear, \\( \\tau = G \\gamma \\), we can relate the shear stress to the shear strain \\( \\gamma \\). Substituting \\( \\tau \\) and solving for \\( \\gamma \\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{P}{2ab} = G \\gamma \\]\n\n\\[ \\gamma = \\frac{P}{2abG} \\]\n\nGiven \\( \\delta \\approx a \\gamma \\):\n\n\\[ \\delta \\approx a \\left( \\frac{P}{2abG} \\right) \\]\n\n\\[ \\delta \\approx \\frac{Pa}{2bG} \\]\n\nTherefore, the displacement \\( \\delta \\) of plate A is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\frac{Pa}{2bhG}} \\]\n\nThis matches option A: \\( \\frac{Pa}{2bhG} \\)."
