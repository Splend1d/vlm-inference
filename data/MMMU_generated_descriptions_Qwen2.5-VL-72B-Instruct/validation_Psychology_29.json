    "question": "Researchers have long studied human memory. In a classic series of studies, the German psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus investigated the storage and recall of information in memory. Based on his findings, he developed the so-called forgetting curve, a way of illustrating the rate at which people forget the information they have learned. The forgetting curve has been studied in a variety of different environments and for a variety of different stimuli. On day 1 of the memory research study, participants were asked to learn a list of items. Researchers then tracked the proportion of the list that the participants remembered as time passed. On day 2, some participants were asked to relearn the list. Again, the proportion remembered was tracked over time. On day 3, some participants were asked to relearn the list a second time, and the proportion they remembered was tracked over time. On day 4, some participants were asked to relearn the list a third time, and the proportion they remembered was tracked over time. The data from this study produced the following set of forgetting curves. Each line represents the memory of the learned or relearned list. The proportion of the list remembered is shown on the y-axis (memory), and the time interval for forgetting is shown on the x-axis (time remembered in days). <image 1> Suppose that one summer you take a training course on the maintenance and service of a certain piece of complex machinery. At the end of the course, you take a qualifying test. If you retake the test every summer for the next few years, based on the graph, how would you expect to perform on the test?",
    "options": "['Test performance would decline sharply at first but decline less and less in later years.', 'Test performance would decline gradually over the years and then stabilize.', 'Test performance would decline sharply at first and continue to decline rapidly until eventually, you were unable to remember anything at all.', 'Test performance would decline only slightly from year to year until eventually, you were unable to remember anything at all.']",

    "description": "The image is a graph depicting the forgetting curve, which illustrates how memory retention changes over time after learning new information. The graph has two axes: the vertical axis (y-axis) represents \"Memory,\" indicating the proportion of information retained, while the horizontal axis (x-axis) represents \"Time remembered (days),\" showing the duration over which the information is retained.\n\nThere are four distinct lines on the graph, each representing a different stage of review or initial learning:\n\n1. **First learning exposure**: This line starts high on the y-axis, indicating full memory retention immediately after learning. As time progresses along the x-axis, the line drops sharply, showing a rapid decline in memory retention. By day 6, the memory retention is significantly low, close to the baseline.\n\n2. **Second review**: This line also begins relatively high but lower than the first learning exposure line. It shows a less steep decline compared to the first learning exposure, meaning memory retention decreases more slowly. By day 6, the memory level is higher than that of the first learning exposure but still relatively low.\n\n3. **Third review**: This line starts even higher than the second review line but lower than the first learning exposure line. The decline in memory retention is even less steep, indicating that the memory is retained better over time. By day 6, the memory level is higher than both the first and second reviews.\n\n4. **Fourth review**: This line starts the highest among the four and shows the least steep decline. Memory retention remains relatively stable over the six days, with only a slight decrease by day 6.\n\nEach subsequent review results in a flatter curve, suggesting that repeated reviews help in retaining information longer and reducing the rate of forgetting. The graph visually demonstrates that the more times the information is reviewed, the slower the rate of forgetting becomes."
