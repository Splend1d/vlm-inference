    "description": "The image is a bar graph illustrating the relationship between exposure to media violence and aggressive behavior in elementary school children, categorized by gender. The x-axis represents levels of exposure to media violence, divided into three categories: Low, Medium, and High. The y-axis measures the percentage of aggressive behavior, ranging from 0% to 100%.\n\nThere are two sets of bars for each level of exposure:\n- Light gray bars represent elementary school girls.\n- Dark gray bars represent elementary school boys.\n\nFor low exposure to media violence:\n- Elementary school girls show approximately 20% aggressive behavior.\n- Elementary school boys show approximately 45% aggressive behavior.\n\nFor medium exposure to media violence:\n- Elementary school girls show approximately 30% aggressive behavior.\n- Elementary school boys show approximately 60% aggressive behavior.\n\nFor high exposure to media violence:\n- Elementary school girls show approximately 60% aggressive behavior.\n- Elementary school boys show approximately 80% aggressive behavior.\n\nIn all cases, both genders exhibit increased aggressive behavior with higher exposure to media violence, with boys consistently showing higher percentages than girls at each level of exposure."
