    "description": "The image shows a coordinate plane with two curves labeled \\( y = g(x) \\) and \\( y = f(x) \\). The curve \\( y = g(x) \\) lies above the curve \\( y = f(x) \\) within the region of interest. There is a horizontal line at \\( y = b \\), which intersects both curves. A vertical line at \\( x = a \\) also intersects both curves and the horizontal line \\( y = b \\).\n\nThe shaded region is bounded by:\n- The vertical line \\( x = a \\) on the right.\n- The horizontal line \\( y = b \\) at the top.\n- The curve \\( y = g(x) \\) from the left to the point where it intersects \\( y = b \\).\n- The curve \\( y = f(x) \\) from the left to the point where it intersects \\( y = b \\).\n\nTo find the area of the shaded region, we need to integrate the difference between the upper boundary (the horizontal line \\( y = b \\)) and the lower boundary (the curve \\( y = f(x) \\)) from \\( x = 0 \\) to \\( x = a \\). However, since the curve \\( y = g(x) \\) is also involved, we must consider the area under \\( y = g(x) \\) as well.\n\nThe correct integral for the area of the shaded region is given by:\n\n\\[ \\int_{0}^{a} \\left[ b - g(x) + f(x) \\right] dx \\]\n\nThis corresponds to option D: \n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
