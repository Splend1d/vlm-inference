    "description": "The image presents a list of financial items categorized into assets and liabilities, along with their respective values in dollars. Here's a detailed breakdown:\n\n**Assets:**\n- Cash: $300\n- Checking: $3,000\n- Savings: $1,200\n- IBM stock: $2,000\n- Retirement funds, IRA: $2,000\n- Money market funds: $1,200\n- Jewelry and artwork: $3,000\n- Household furnishings: $4,200\n- Real estate: $150,000\n- 2014 Sebring: $15,000\n- 2010 Jeep: $8,000\n\n**Liabilities:**\n- Auto loan: $8,000\n- Mortgage: $100,000\n- Medical bills payable: $250\n- Utility bills payable: $150\n- Credit card balance: $2,000\n- Personal loan: $3,000\n\n**Net Worth:** $76,500\n\nTo calculate Net Working Capital (NWC), we need to identify **liquid assets** and **current liabilities**:\n- Liquid assets include cash, checking, savings, money market funds, and potentially stocks (IBM stock). These add up to: $300 + $3,000 + $1,200 + $1,200 + $2,000 = $7,700.\n- Current liabilities include auto loan, medical bills payable, utility bills payable, credit card balance, and personal loan. These add up to: $8,000 + $250 + $150 + $2,000 + $3,000 = $13,400.\n\nNet Working Capital (NWC) is calculated as:\n\\[ \\text{NWC} = \\text{Total Liquid Assets} - \\text{Total Current Liabilities} \\]\n\\[ \\text{NWC} = \\$7,700 - \\$13,400 = -\\$5,700 \\]\n\nHowever, since the question asks for the closest positive value among the options provided, it seems there might be an error or misinterpretation in the calculation or data. Based on the given options, none match the calculated result. Nonetheless, the closest positive option would be **$3,100**, which is option B."
