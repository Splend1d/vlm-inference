    "question": "The figure below <image 1> shows a stable structure of a protein that is to be used for each part of this problem. The dashed line divides the structure into three regions labeled A, B, and C in the figure. Which one of the three parts of this protein is comprised mostly of $\\alpha$-helical secondary structure?",

    "description": "The image depicts a three-dimensional representation of a protein structure divided into three distinct regions labeled A, B, and C by a dashed line. Region A is located on the left side of the image and consists primarily of a complex arrangement of loops and turns with no prominent helical structures. Region B is situated in the upper right portion of the image and is characterized by a series of parallel lines that represent \u03b1-helices, indicating a high degree of \u03b1-helical secondary structure. Region C is found at the bottom of the image and is composed mainly of \u03b2-sheets, which appear as flat, ribbon-like structures. The dashed line clearly demarcates these regions, allowing for the identification of their respective structural features. Based on this description, region B is predominantly comprised of \u03b1-helical secondary structure."
