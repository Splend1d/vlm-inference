    "description": "The image shows a histological section stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). The tissue appears to consist of numerous small, round cells with darkly stained nuclei and scant cytoplasm. These cells are densely packed together, forming a pattern that resembles a \"rosette\" or \"flower-like\" arrangement. Some of these rosettes have a central lumen, which is characteristic of certain types of tumors. The overall appearance suggests a tumor composed of primitive neuroectodermal cells.\n\nGiven the characteristics described\u2014small, round cells with dark nuclei, rosette formations, and a primitive neuroectodermal appearance\u2014the tumor depicted is most likely an ependymoma. Ependymomas are known for their association with seizures, especially when located in the brain. They can occur both in children and adults but are more commonly found in children. Additionally, they can be intraventricular in location, particularly in pediatric cases. However, the presence of binucleate neurons is not a typical feature of ependymomas.\n\nTherefore, based on the description:\n\n- **A. more common in children than adults** - This is true.\n- **B. may be intraventricular in children** - This is also true.\n- **C. is often associated with seizures** - This is correct.\n- **D. also has binucleate neurons** - This is not typically associated with ependymomas."
