The mosaic features numerous figures, including soldiers on horseback and on foot, engaged in combat. The figures are depicted with great attention to detail, showcasing their muscular anatomy and expressive postures. The horses are also rendered with realistic anatomy, displaying powerful movements and tension. The use of small tiles allows for fine gradations in color and shading, contributing to the naturalistic representation of the figures and their surroundings. The background includes elements like dust clouds and additional soldiers, adding depth and complexity to the scene. The overall composition is well-organized, with a clear focus on the central action, despite the multitude of details. The mosaic's technique enables the artist to create a vivid and lifelike portrayal of the battle, emphasizing the realism and dynamism of the scene."
