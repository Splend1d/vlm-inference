    "description": "The image is a table presenting data for a closed traverse with four lines: AB, BC, CD, and DA. The table includes two columns: \"Latitude (m)\" and \"Departure (m).\" Here's the detailed breakdown:\n\n- **Line AB**:  \n  - Latitude: -116.1 meters  \n  - Departure: -44.4 meters  \n\n- **Line BC**:  \n  - Latitude: +6.8 meters  \n  - Departure: +58.2 meters  \n\n- **Line CD**:  \n  - Latitude: +80.5 meters  \n  - Departure: +17.2 meters  \n\n- **Line DA**:  \n  - Latitude: +28.8 meters  \n  - Departure: -31.0 meters  \n\nThis table provides the necessary latitude and departure values required to calculate the area of the traverse using the Double Meridian Distance (D.M.D.) method. The values are in meters, and the traverse is closed, meaning it forms a complete loop."
