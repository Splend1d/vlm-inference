The results of all examinations were summarised in the table.<image 1> The +LR of the parallel test was",

    "description": "The provided table summarizes the results of two screening tests\u2014electronic colposcopy and ThinPrep Cytology Test (TCT)\u2014for detecting cervical lesions versus non-cervical lesions among 600 gynecological outpatient cases. The table categorizes the patients into four groups based on the combination of test results (+ or -) from both methods and whether they had cervical lesions or non-cervical lesions as confirmed by cervical histopathology.\n\n### Table Breakdown:\n\n#### Columns:\n1. **Test Results**:\n   - **Electronic Colposcopy**: Indicates positive (+) or negative (-) results.\n   - **TCT**: Indicates positive (+) or negative (-) results.\n\n#### Rows:\n1. **Patients with Cervical Lesions**:\n   - Total: 100 patients.\n   - Breakdown:\n     - Electronic Colposcopy (+) & TCT (-): 15 patients.\n     - Electronic Colposcopy (-) & TCT (+): 5 patients.\n     - Electronic Colposcopy (+) & TCT (+): 70 patients.\n     - Electronic Colposcopy (-) & TCT (-): 10 patients.\n\n2. **Patients with Non-Cervical Lesions**:\n   - Total: 500 patients.\n   - Breakdown:\n     - Electronic Colposcopy (+) & TCT (-): 10 patients.\n     - Electronic Colposcopy (-) & TCT (+): 220 patients.\n     - Electronic Colposcopy (+) & TCT (+): 25 patients.\n     - Electronic Colposcopy (-) & TCT (-): 245 patients.\n\n### Parallel Test Calculation:\nFor the parallel test, a case is considered positive if either electronic colposcopy or TCT is positive. \n\n#### Positive Cases:\n- Patients with cervical lesions: 15 + 5 + 70 = 90\n- Patients with non-cervical lesions: 10 + 220 + 25 = 255\n\n#### Negative Cases:\n- Patients with cervical lesions: 10\n- Patients with non-cervical lesions: 245\n\n#### Sensitivity and Specificity:\n- **Sensitivity** (True Positive Rate): 90 / 100 = 0.90\n- **Specificity** (True Negative Rate): 245 / 500 = 0.49\n\n#### Positive Likelihood Ratio (+LR):\n+LR = Sensitivity / (1 - Specificity)\n= 0.90 / (1 - 0.49)\n= 0.90 / 0.51\n\u2248 1.76\n\nThus, the +LR of the parallel test is approximately **1.76**, which corresponds to option A."
