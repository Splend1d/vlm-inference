    "description": "The image depicts a periodic piecewise function \\( f(t) \\) plotted against time \\( t \\). The function is defined over an interval from -5 to 5, with the following characteristics:\n\n- From \\( t = -5 \\) to \\( t = -4 \\), the function decreases linearly from 0 to -1.\n- From \\( t = -4 \\) to \\( t = -3 \\), the function remains constant at -1.\n- From \\( t = -3 \\) to \\( t = -1 \\), the function increases linearly from -1 to 1.\n- From \\( t = -1 \\) to \\( t = 1 \\), the function remains constant at 1.\n- From \\( t = 1 \\) to \\( t = 3 \\), the function decreases linearly from 1 to -1.\n- From \\( t = 3 \\) to \\( t = 4 \\), the function remains constant at -1.\n- From \\( t = 4 \\) to \\( t = 5 \\), the function increases linearly from -1 to 0.\n\nThe function is periodic with a period of 6 units. The function repeats itself every 6 units along the \\( t \\)-axis. The amplitude of the function varies between -1 and 1. The function is symmetric about the vertical line \\( t = 0 \\).\n\nTo find the Fourier series of this waveform, you would need to calculate the coefficients using the standard formulas for Fourier series. Once you have the Fourier series, you can then evaluate the sum of the first four terms at \\( t = 2 \\)."
