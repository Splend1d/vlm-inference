    "description": "The image depicts a geometric diagram involving four points: A, B, C, and D, with an additional point S. Point A is connected to points B, C, and D by straight lines, forming a network of triangles. The distances between these points are labeled as follows:\n\n- Line AB measures 3190.32 meters.\n- Line AC measures 4085.15 meters.\n- Line AD measures 3108.60 meters.\n\nPoint S is located 12 meters away from point A along a line perpendicular to the plane formed by points A, B, C, and D. From point S, angles (bearings) are observed toward points A, B, C, and D. These angles are denoted as follows:\n\n- The bearing to point A is 0\u00b000'00\".\n- The bearing to point B is 143\u00b036'20\".\n- The bearing to point C is 238\u00b024'48\".\n- The bearing to point D is 307\u00b018'54\".\n\nThe problem involves determining the directions (angles) of points B, C, and D relative to point A. The options provided for these directions are:\n\nA. B = 143\u00b044'00.34\"; C = 238\u00b010'11.87\"; D = 307\u00b008'20.76\"\nB. B = 143\u00b044'00.34\"; C = 238\u00b014'11.87\"; D = 307\u00b008'20.76\"\nC. B = 143\u00b044'00.34\"; C = 238\u00b016'11.87\"; D = 307\u00b008'20.76\"\nD. B = 143\u00b044'00.34\"; C = 238\u00b012'11.87\"; D = 307\u00b008'20.76\"\n\nThe task is to determine which set of angles correctly represents the directions of B, C, and D from point A."
