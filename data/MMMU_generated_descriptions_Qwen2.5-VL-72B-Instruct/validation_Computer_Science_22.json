    "description": "The image depicts a Non-Deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA) with five states labeled 0 through 4. The start state is labeled as 0. There are two accepting states: state 2 and state 4, indicated by double circles around them.\n\n- From the start state 0, there are two epsilon (\u03b5) transitions leading to states 1 and 3.\n- From state 1, there is a transition labeled 'a' leading to state 2.\n- State 2 has a self-loop labeled 'a', meaning it can stay in state 2 upon reading an 'a'.\n- From state 3, there is a transition labeled 'b' leading to state 4.\n- State 4 has a self-loop labeled 'b', meaning it can stay in state 4 upon reading a 'b'.\n\nThis NFA recognizes strings that either consist of zero or more 'a's (including the empty string) followed by any number of additional 'a's, or zero or more 'b's (including the empty string) followed by any number of additional 'b's. In other words, it recognizes strings that are either all 'a's or all 'b's, including the empty string.\n\nThe regular expression that describes the language recognized by this NFA is `a* | b*`. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. a*|b*"
