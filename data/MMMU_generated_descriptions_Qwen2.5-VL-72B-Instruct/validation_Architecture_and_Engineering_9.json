    "question": "A railway embankment 400 m long is 12 m wide at the formation level. The side slope of the embankment is 2:1. The formation level at zero chainage is 107.00. The embankment has a rising gradient of 1 in 100. The ground is level across the c/l. Calculate the volume of earthwork using the prismoidal rule with the following observations:<image 1>",

    "description": "The image provided is a table containing two columns: \"Distance (m)\" and \"R.L. (m)\". The data within these columns is as follows:\n\n- At a distance of 0 meters, the reduced level (R.L.) is 104.8 meters.\n- At a distance of 100 meters, the R.L. is 106.2 meters.\n- At a distance of 200 meters, the R.L. is 107.5 meters.\n- At a distance of 300 meters, the R.L. is 107.2 meters.\n- At a distance of 400 meters, the R.L. is 108.3 meters.\n\nThis table provides the reduced levels at various distances along the length of the railway embankment, which is necessary for calculating the volume of earthwork using the prismoidal rule."
