    "question": "A room is kept at 25\u00b0C by a vapor-compressionrefrigeration cycle with R-134a as the refrigerant. Heat is rejected to cooling water that enters the condenser at 20\u00b0C at a rate of 0.13 kg/s and leaves at 28\u00b0C. The refrigerant enters the condenser at 1.2 MPa and 50\u00b0C and leave as a saturated liquid. If the compressor consumes 1.9 kW of power, determine the exergy destruction in the condenser. Take T0 = 20\u00b0C and $c_{p,water}$ = 4.18 kJ/kg\u22c5\u00b0C<image 1>",

    "description": "The image depicts a vapor-compression refrigeration cycle using R-134a as the refrigerant. The cycle consists of four main components: an evaporator, a compressor, a condenser, and an expansion valve. Here's a detailed description of each component and the flow of the refrigerant:\n\n1. **Evaporator**: \n   - The refrigerant enters the evaporator as a low-pressure, low-temperature mixture of liquid and vapor.\n   - Heat (\\(\\dot{Q}_L\\)) is absorbed from the surroundings (the room) through the evaporator coils, causing the refrigerant to vaporize completely.\n   - The refrigerant exits the evaporator as a saturated vapor.\n\n2. **Compressor**:\n   - The saturated vapor from the evaporator is drawn into the compressor.\n   - The compressor increases the pressure and temperature of the refrigerant.\n   - The refrigerant exits the compressor at a high pressure (1.2 MPa) and high temperature (50\u00b0C).\n   - The compressor consumes 1.9 kW of power (\\(\\dot{W}_{in}\\)).\n\n3. **Condenser**:\n   - The high-pressure, high-temperature refrigerant enters the condenser.\n   - Heat is rejected from the refrigerant to the cooling water.\n   - The cooling water enters the condenser at 20\u00b0C at a rate of 0.13 kg/s and leaves at 28\u00b0C.\n   - The refrigerant condenses and exits the condenser as a saturated liquid at 1.2 MPa.\n\n4. **Expansion Valve**:\n   - The high-pressure saturated liquid refrigerant from the condenser enters the expansion valve.\n   - The expansion valve reduces the pressure and temperature of the refrigerant.\n   - The refrigerant exits the expansion valve as a low-pressure, low-temperature mixture of liquid and vapor, ready to enter the evaporator again.\n\nTo determine the exergy destruction in the condenser, we need to calculate the heat transfer rate in the condenser and use it to find the exergy destruction. The heat transfer rate (\\(\\dot{Q}_{cond}\\)) can be calculated using the cooling water data:\n\n\\[\n\\dot{Q}_{cond} = \\dot{m}_{water} \\cdot c_{p,water} \\cdot (T_{out} - T_{in})\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\(\\dot{m}_{water} = 0.13\\) kg/s\n- \\(c_{p,water} = 4.18\\) kJ/kg\u00b7\u00b0C\n- \\(T_{out} = 28\\)\u00b0C\n- \\(T_{in} = 20\\)\u00b0C\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n\\[\n\\dot{Q}_{cond} = 0.13 \\cdot 4.18 \\cdot (28 - 20) = 0.13 \\cdot 4.18 \\cdot 8 = 4.3744 \\text{ kW}\n\\]\n\nThe exergy destruction (\\(\\dot{E}_{des}\\)) in the condenser can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\dot{E}_{des} = \\dot{Q}_{cond} \\left(1 - \\frac{T_0}{T_{cond}}\\right)\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\(T_0 = 20 + 273.15 = 293.15\\) K (ambient temperature in Kelvin)\n- \\(T_{cond} = 50 + 273.15 = 323.15\\) K (condenser temperature in Kelvin)\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n\\[\n\\dot{E}_{des} = 4.3744 \\left(1 - \\frac{293.15}{323.15}\\right) = 4.3744 \\left(1 - 0.9072\\right) = 4.3744 \\cdot 0.0928 = 0.405 \\text{ kW}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the exergy destruction in the condenser is approximately 0.4 kW. However, since the options provided are 0.1 kW, 0.2 kW, and 0.3 kW, the closest value is 0.3 kW. Thus, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 0.3 kW"
