    "question": "A dam is to be constructed across a valley to form a reservoir, and the areas in the following table enclosed by contour loops were obtained from a plan of the area involved.If the 660 m level represents the level floor of the reservoir, use the prismoidal formula to calculate the volume of water impounded when the water level reaches 700 m.<image 1>",
    "options": "['29.893 * 106 $m^{3}$', '29.293 * 106 $m^{3}$', '29.493 * 106 $m^{3}$', '29.693 * 106 $m^{3}$']",

    "description": "The image presents a table with two columns: \"Contour (m)\" and \"Area\". The table lists the following data:\n\n| Contour (m) | Area |\n|-------------|------|\n| 660         | 5200 |\n| 665         | 9400 |\n| 670         | 16300 |\n| 675         | 22400 |\n| 680         | 40700 |\n| 685         | 61500 |\n| 690         | 112200 |\n| 695         | 198100 |\n| 670         | 272400 |\n\nThis table provides the areas enclosed by contour lines at various elevation levels in meters. The contour levels range from 660 m to 695 m, with an additional entry for 670 m at the end. The corresponding areas are given in square meters. \n\nThe question asks to use the prismoidal formula to calculate the volume of water impounded when the water level reaches 700 m, assuming the 660 m level represents the floor of the reservoir. The options provided for the calculated volume are:\n- A. 29.893 * 10^6 m\u00b3\n- B. 29.293 * 10^6 m\u00b3\n- C. 29.493 * 10^6 m\u00b3\n- D. 29.693 * 10^6 m\u00b3\n\nTo solve this problem, one would need to apply the prismoidal formula using the given contour levels and areas."
