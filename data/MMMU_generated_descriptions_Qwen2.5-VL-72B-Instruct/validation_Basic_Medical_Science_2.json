    "options": "['Cardiac muscle', 'Bone', 'Skeletal muscle']",
    "id": "validation_Basic_Medical_Science_2",
    "description": "The image shows a series of parallel, cylindrical structures with a consistent, repeating pattern. These structures appear to have a smooth, glossy surface and are evenly spaced. The color of these structures is a uniform pinkish-red, and they are aligned in a linear fashion, running horizontally across the image. There are no visible striations or cross-striations that would typically be associated with skeletal muscle fibers. Additionally, there are no signs of the complex, branching network characteristic of cardiac muscle. The overall appearance suggests a more uniform and less complex structure compared to the intricate patterns seen in muscle tissues. \n\nGiven the description, the image does not depict any type of muscle tissue. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Bone\n\nThis conclusion is based on the uniformity and lack of striations or branching patterns typical of muscle tissues."
