The top illustration shows a person sitting at a desk, using a computer. This individual appears to be engaged in digital activities, possibly browsing or working online. The bottom illustration depicts another person standing outdoors, holding what seems to be a radio or a similar device, suggesting limited access to modern technology. \n\nOn the right side of the image, there is text that reads \"Digital Divide\" followed by its phonetic pronunciation \"[\u02c8d\u026ad\u0292\u0259-t\u0259l d\u0259-\u02c8v\u012bd].\" Below this, there is a definition: \"The gap between people who have access to modern information and communications technology and those who don't.\" The overall design emphasizes the contrast between those with and without access to advanced technology, visually representing the concept of the digital divide."
