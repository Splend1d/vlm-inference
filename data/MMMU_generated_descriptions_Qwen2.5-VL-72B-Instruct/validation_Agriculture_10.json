    "description": "The image shows a close-up view of a network of intertwined, thin, white roots embedded in soil. Attached to these roots are numerous small, round, yellowish spheres. These spheres vary slightly in size but are generally uniform in shape and color. They appear to be firmly attached to the roots, suggesting they are not simply resting on them but are part of a biological interaction. The soil surrounding the roots is dark and appears moist, indicating a natural underground environment. The yellow spheres are scattered along the length of the roots, with some areas having a higher concentration than others. The overall appearance suggests a parasitic or symbiotic relationship between the roots and the yellow spheres. \n\nBased on this description, the yellow spheres that are connected to the roots of the potato are most likely:\n\nB. Cysts"
