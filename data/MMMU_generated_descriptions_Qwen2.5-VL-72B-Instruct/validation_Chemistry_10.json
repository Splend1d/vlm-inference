    "description": "The image depicts an electrochemical cell setup consisting of two half-cells connected by a salt bridge and a voltmeter. The left half-cell contains a zinc electrode (Zn(s)) immersed in a solution of 1.0 M Zn\u00b2\u207a(aq). The right half-cell contains a silver electrode (Ag(s)) immersed in a solution of 1.0 M Ag\u207a(aq). A salt bridge connects the two solutions to allow ion flow between them, maintaining electrical neutrality. The voltmeter measures the potential difference between the two electrodes.\n\nAdditionally, a table provides the standard reduction potentials for the relevant half-reactions:\n- For the silver half-reaction: Ag\u207a(aq) + e\u207b \u2192 Ag(s), the standard reduction potential E\u00b0 is +0.80 V.\n- For the zinc half-reaction: Zn\u00b2\u207a(aq) + 2e\u207b \u2192 Zn(s), the standard reduction potential E\u00b0 is -0.76 V.\n\nThese details are essential for determining the net ionic equation for the overall reaction occurring in the cell."
