    "description": "The image depicts a P-V (pressure-volume) diagram for an ideal gas. The axes are labeled with \"P\" for pressure along the vertical axis and \"V\" for volume along the horizontal axis. There are three points marked on the graph: point 1, point 2, and point 3. \n\nPoint 1 is located at a higher pressure and lower volume compared to point 2. Point 2 is at a lower pressure and higher volume than point 1. Point 3 lies between points 1 and 2 in terms of both pressure and volume. A curved line connects point 1 to point 2, indicating a process where the gas transitions from state 1 to state 2. This curve is characteristic of an adiabatic process, which means no heat is exchanged with the surroundings (Q = 0). \n\nFrom point 2 to point 3, there is a horizontal line, suggesting an isothermal process where the temperature remains constant (\u0394T = 0). However, this part of the process is not relevant to answering the question about the change in temperature and heat transfer during the 1-2 process. \n\nThe key information for answering the question is that the process from 1 to 2 is adiabatic (Q = 0), and since the volume increases while the pressure decreases along this path, it implies work is done by the gas, leading to a decrease in internal energy and thus a decrease in temperature (\u0394T < 0). Therefore, the correct statement about the change in temperature and heat transferred during the 1-2 process is B. \u0394T < 0, Q = 0."
