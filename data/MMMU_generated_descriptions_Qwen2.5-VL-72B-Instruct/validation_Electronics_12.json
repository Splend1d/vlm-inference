    "description": "The image depicts a common-emitter transistor amplifier circuit labeled as \"Fig. 1.\" The circuit consists of a bipolar junction transistor (BJT) with its three terminals: the base (B), the collector (C), and the emitter (E). \n\n- The base terminal (B) is connected to ground through a resistor \\( R_B \\).\n- The collector terminal (C) is connected to a power supply \\( V_{CC} \\) through a resistor \\( R_C \\).\n- The emitter terminal (E) is directly connected to ground.\n  \nThe power supply \\( V_{CC} \\) is indicated at the top of the diagram, providing a positive voltage relative to ground. The current directions for the base current \\( I_B \\), collector current \\( I_C \\), and emitter current \\( I_E \\) are also shown. The arrows indicate that \\( I_B \\) flows into the base, \\( I_C \\) flows out of the collector, and \\( I_E \\) flows out of the emitter.\n\nThe resistors \\( R_B \\) and \\( R_C \\) are labeled with their respective positions in the circuit. The values of these resistors, along with other parameters like \\( V_{CC} \\), \\( \\beta \\) (current gain), and the negligible leakage current, are provided in the question. The goal is to determine the collector-to-emitter voltage \\( V_{CE} \\).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( V_{CC} = 24 \\, \\text{V} \\)\n- \\( R_B = 960 \\, \\text{k}\\Omega \\)\n- \\( R_C = 7 \\, \\text{k}\\Omega \\)\n- \\( \\beta = 80 \\)\n\nTo find \\( V_{CE} \\), one would typically calculate the base current \\( I_B \\), then use \\( \\beta \\) to find the collector current \\( I_C \\), and finally apply Ohm's law and Kirchhoff's voltage law to determine \\( V_{CE} \\)."
