    "question": "Refer to the figure <image 1>, which term describes reading aloud in unison or parts with a whole class, small group, or individual students so that students hear the text at the same time they read it?",
    "options": "['Choral Reading', 'Literature Circle', 'Readers Theatre', 'Shared Reading']",
    "id": "validation_Literature_15",
    "description": "The image depicts a classroom setting where a group of students is seated in rows of desks facing forward, presumably toward a teacher or a presentation area. The students appear to be engaged in an activity, possibly listening or preparing to participate. There are educational posters on the walls, including diagrams and charts, suggesting an academic environment. The students are dressed casually, and some have notebooks or papers on their desks. The arrangement of the desks and the focus of the students indicate a structured learning activity. \n\nGiven the context of the classroom and the students' attentive posture, it is likely that they are participating in a reading activity where they might be reading aloud together. This type of activity, where students read aloud in unison or parts with a whole class, small group, or individual students so that students hear the text at the same time they read it, is known as \"Choral Reading.\" Therefore, the correct answer to the question is A. Choral Reading."
