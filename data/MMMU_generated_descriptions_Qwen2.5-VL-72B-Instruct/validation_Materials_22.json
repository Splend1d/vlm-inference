    "description": "The image depicts a truss structure with various members connected at joints labeled A through F. The truss is subjected to external loads and supported by reactions at points A and D. Here's a detailed description:\n\n- **Joints and Members**: \n  - The truss has six joints: A, B, C, D, E, and F.\n  - Members connect these joints in a triangular pattern, forming a stable structure.\n\n- **External Loads**:\n  - A vertical load of 800 lb acts downward at joint F.\n  - A horizontal load of 400 lb acts to the left at joint B.\n\n- **Dimensions**:\n  - Each horizontal segment between adjacent joints (e.g., AB, BC, CD) is 6 ft long.\n  - The vertical distance from the base (AD) to joint F is not explicitly given but can be inferred using trigonometry and the angles provided.\n\n- **Angles**:\n  - The angle between member AB and the horizontal is 30\u00b0.\n  - The angle between member BF and the horizontal is 60\u00b0.\n  - The angle between member AF and the horizontal is 45\u00b0.\n\n- **Supports**:\n  - Joint A is supported by a pin, allowing both vertical and horizontal reaction forces.\n  - Joint D is supported by a roller, allowing only a vertical reaction force.\n\n- **Member BC**:\n  - Member BC is a horizontal member connecting joints B and C.\n  - The length of member BC is 6 ft.\n\nTo determine the required cross-sectional area of member BC, you need to calculate the axial force in member BC using methods like the method of joints or the method of sections. Once the axial force is known, use the formula for normal stress:\n\n\\[ \\sigma = \\frac{F}{A} \\]\n\nwhere \\( \\sigma \\) is the stress, \\( F \\) is the axial force, and \\( A \\) is the cross-sectional area. Rearrange the formula to solve for \\( A \\):\n\n\\[ A = \\frac{F}{\\sigma_{\\text{allow}}} \\]\n\nGiven \\( \\sigma_{\\text{allow}} = 24 \\text{ ksi} \\), convert this to pounds per square inch (psi) since the loads are in pounds. Then, substitute the calculated axial force \\( F \\) and solve for \\( A \\). The correct answer will be one of the options provided."
