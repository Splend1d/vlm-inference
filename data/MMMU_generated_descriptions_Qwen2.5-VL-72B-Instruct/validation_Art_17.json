    "question": "Mayan chacmool sculptures such as this one heavily influenced which of the following twentieth-century sculptors? <image 1>",
    "options": "['Louise Bourgeois', 'Henry Moore', 'Barbara Hepworth', 'Constantin Brancusi']",
    "id": "validation_Art_17",
    "description": "The image depicts a Mayan chacmool sculpture situated in an outdoor setting near a beach. The sculpture is made of stone and features a reclining human figure with its head turned to one side and its legs bent at the knees. The figure's hands rest on its stomach, forming a bowl-like shape. The background shows a clear blue sky with scattered clouds, a turquoise ocean, and a sandy beach with a few people walking along it. The sculpture is placed on a stone pedestal, and there is grass surrounding the base of the pedestal. The overall scene suggests a serene coastal environment.\n\nThe chacmool sculpture is a significant example of ancient Mesoamerican art, particularly associated with the Maya civilization. Its distinctive pose and form have been influential in various artistic movements and styles throughout history. In the context of twentieth-century sculpture, the influence of such ancient forms can be seen in the works of several artists who drew inspiration from pre-Columbian art.\n\nAmong the options provided, Henry Moore is known for his abstract, organic forms and reclining figures, which bear a resemblance to the posture and composition of the chacmool. Moore was deeply influenced by non-Western art, including ancient Mexican sculptures, and incorporated elements of these influences into his own work. Therefore, the Mayan chacmool sculptures such as the one depicted in the image heavily influenced Henry Moore."
