    "description": "The image displays a table containing two columns of numerical data for 10 individuals:\n\n1. **Systolic Blood Pressure (mmHg):** This column lists the systolic blood pressures measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg) for each individual. The values are: 118, 122, 128, 134, 144, 128, 162, 154, 146, and 128.\n   \n2. **Body Mass Index (BMI):** This column lists the Body Mass Index (BMI) values for each individual. The BMI values are: 19, 22, 28, 29, 34, 21, 32, 38, 22, and 21.\n\nThe table provides paired measurements of systolic blood pressure and BMI for each of the 10 men aged between 35 and 45 years. \n\nAdditionally, the question mentions results from a linear regression analysis conducted using this data:\n- The regression coefficient (b) is 1.648.\n- The sum of squares due to regression (SS regression or SS back) is 1044.352.\n- The total sum of squares (SS total) is 1,878.400.\n\nThe task is to determine the coefficient of determination (R\u00b2), which measures the proportion of variance in the dependent variable (systolic blood pressure) explained by the independent variable (BMI). The options provided for R\u00b2 are:\nA. 0.444  \nB. 0.556  \nC. 1.799  \nD. 2.716  \n\nTo calculate R\u00b2, you would use the formula:  \n\\[ R^2 = \\frac{SS_{\\text{regression}}}{SS_{\\text{total}}} \\]  \nSubstituting the given values:  \n\\[ R^2 = \\frac{1044.352}{1878.400} \\approx 0.556 \\]\n\nThus, the correct answer is B. 0.556."
