    "description": "The image shows a field with rows of plants growing in what appears to be mulched soil. The plants have large, green leaves with a lobed shape, characteristic of certain types of crops like cucurbits (e.g., watermelon or squash). The leaves are drooping downward, indicating a lack of turgor pressure. This drooping is consistent across multiple plants in the image. In the background, there is an orange building and some hills, but these elements are not relevant to the condition of the plants. The overall appearance of the plants suggests they are suffering from a condition where the leaves are not standing upright but are instead hanging down, which is commonly associated with a lack of water or other stress factors. \n\nBased on this description, the most appropriate terminology for this symptom is:\n\nD. Wilt"
