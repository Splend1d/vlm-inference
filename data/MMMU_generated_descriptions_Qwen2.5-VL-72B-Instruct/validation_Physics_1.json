    "description": "The image shows four identical current-carrying wires arranged in a square configuration. Each wire has a current of 4A flowing out of the plane of the page, indicated by a dot at the center of each wire. The wires are positioned at the corners of an imaginary square. The wire located at the bottom-right corner is labeled \"P.\" \n\nThe other three wires are positioned as follows:\n- One wire is directly to the left of wire P.\n- Another wire is directly above wire P.\n- The last wire is diagonally opposite to wire P, located at the top-left corner of the square.\n\nEach wire carries the same current magnitude and direction, meaning they all have currents flowing out of the page. The question asks for the direction of the total magnetic force on wire P due to the magnetic fields produced by the other three wires."
