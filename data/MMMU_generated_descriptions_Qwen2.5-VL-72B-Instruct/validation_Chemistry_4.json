    "description": "The image depicts a cyclohexane ring with two substituents attached to it. The ring is drawn in its chair conformation. One substituent is a chlorine (Cl) atom, and the other is a methyl (CH\u2083) group. Both substituents are located on adjacent carbon atoms of the ring.\n\nThe chlorine atom is positioned in an axial orientation, pointing downward (indicated by a dashed line). The methyl group is also in an axial orientation but points upward (indicated by a bold wedge). Since both substituents are in axial positions and point in opposite directions relative to the plane of the ring, they are in a trans configuration. Therefore, the compound is **trans-1-chloro-2-methylcyclohexane**."
