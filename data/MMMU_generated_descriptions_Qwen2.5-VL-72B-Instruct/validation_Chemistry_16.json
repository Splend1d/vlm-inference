    "description": "The image shows a Lewis structure of a molecule with a central sulfur (S) atom. The sulfur atom is bonded to four other atoms, each represented by a different symbol: two are oxygen (O) atoms, and two are fluorine (F) atoms. Each bond between the sulfur and these surrounding atoms is depicted as a single line, indicating a single covalent bond. Additionally, each of the surrounding atoms has three pairs of electrons (six dots) around them, representing lone pairs. The arrangement of the bonds and lone pairs around the sulfur atom suggests a symmetrical distribution in three-dimensional space. The overall geometry appears to have four points extending outward from the central sulfur atom, forming equal angles between each point. This indicates a tetrahedral arrangement where the central atom is at the center of a tetrahedron, and the surrounding atoms are at the vertices. \n\nBased on this description, the geometric shape of the molecule is best described as **tetrahedral**."
