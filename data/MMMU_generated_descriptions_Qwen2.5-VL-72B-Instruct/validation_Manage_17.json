    "description": "The image displays a table titled \"BROKERAGE RATES ON ODD LOTS,\" which outlines the commission rates for purchasing stocks in odd lots (non-standard quantities). The table has two columns: \"Amount of Purchase\" and \"Commission.\" The rows detail different purchase amount ranges and their corresponding commission structures:\n\n1. For an \"Amount of Purchase\" between $100 and $799:\n   - The \"Commission\" is calculated as 2.0% of the purchase amount plus a flat fee of $4.40. However, the total commission cannot exceed $65.\n\n2. For an \"Amount of Purchase\" between $800 and $2,499:\n   - The \"Commission\" is calculated as 1.3% of the purchase amount plus a flat fee of $10. Again, the total commission cannot exceed $65.\n\n3. For an \"Amount of Purchase\" of $2,500 and above:\n   - The \"Commission\" is calculated as 0.9% of the purchase amount plus a flat fee of $20. The maximum commission remains capped at $65.\n\nThis table provides the necessary information to determine the commission rate applicable to Mr. Samuels' purchase based on the total amount he spent."
