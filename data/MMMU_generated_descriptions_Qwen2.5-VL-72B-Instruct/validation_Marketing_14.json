    "question": "You see a game at a local fair. You have to throw a dart at a color wheel. Each section on the color wheel is equal in area. <image 1> Let B = the event of landing on blue. Let R = the event of landing on red. Let G = the event of landing on green. Let Y = the event of landing on yellow. If you land on Y, you get the biggest prize. Find P(Y).",

    "description": "The image shows a circular color wheel divided into eight equal sections. The sections are colored as follows:\n\n- Three sections are red.\n- Two sections are blue.\n- One section is green.\n- One section is yellow.\n- One section is red (repeated for clarity).\n\nEach section occupies an equal portion of the circle, meaning each section represents 1/8 of the total area of the circle. The colors are distributed evenly around the circle with no overlapping or irregular shapes. The labels provided in the question correspond to these colors: B for blue, R for red, G for green, and Y for yellow. The goal is to determine the probability \\( P(Y) \\), which is the likelihood of landing on the yellow section. Since there is one yellow section out of eight total sections, the probability \\( P(Y) \\) is 1/8."
