    "question": "The pump-turbine system in Fig. P3.135 draws water from the upper reservoir in the daytime to produce power for a city. At night, it pumps water from lower to upper reservoirs to restore the situation. For a design flow rate of 15,000 gal/min in either direction, the friction head loss is 17 ft. Estimate the power in kW extracted by the turbine. <image 1>",

    "description": "The image depicts a pump-turbine system used for energy storage and power generation. The system consists of two reservoirs connected by a pipeline with a pump-turbine in between. \n\n- **Reservoirs:** There are two reservoirs labeled as points \u2460 and \u2461. \n  - Point \u2460 represents the upper reservoir, which is at an elevation \\( Z_1 = 150 \\) feet.\n  - Point \u2461 represents the lower reservoir, which is at an elevation \\( Z_2 = 25 \\) feet.\n  \n- **Water Flow:** Water flows between these reservoirs through a pipeline. The water temperature is specified as 20\u00b0C. The flow rate is given as 15,000 gallons per minute (gal/min) in either direction (both when pumping and generating).\n\n- **Pump-Turbine:** A pump-turbine is located in the pipeline between the two reservoirs. This device functions as a pump when transferring water from the lower reservoir to the upper reservoir and as a turbine when water flows from the upper reservoir to the lower reservoir to generate power.\n\n- **Friction Head Loss:** The problem specifies that the friction head loss in the pipeline is 17 feet.\n\n- **Power Calculation Context:** The question asks for the power extracted by the turbine when water flows from the upper reservoir to the lower reservoir. The difference in elevation between the two reservoirs (\\( Z_1 - Z_2 \\)) is \\( 150 \\text{ ft} - 25 \\text{ ft} = 125 \\text{ ft} \\). The total effective head available for power generation includes this elevation difference minus the friction head loss.\n\nGiven these details, you can calculate the power output using the formula for hydraulic power:\n\n\\[ \\text{Power (hp)} = \\frac{\\text{Flow Rate (gpm)} \\times \\text{Total Head (ft)}}{3960 \\times \\eta} \\]\n\nWhere:\n- Flow Rate = 15,000 gpm,\n- Total Head = \\( 125 \\text{ ft} - 17 \\text{ ft} = 108 \\text{ ft} \\),\n- Efficiency (\\(\\eta\\)) is assumed to be close to 1 for this calculation.\n\nFinally, convert the calculated power from horsepower (hp) to kilowatts (kW) using the conversion factor \\( 1 \\text{ hp} = 0.7457 \\text{ kW} \\)."
