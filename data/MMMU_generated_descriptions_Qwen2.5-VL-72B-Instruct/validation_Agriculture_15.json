    "question": "<image 1> What could be the reason for this grassy-like clump in the maize photographed by my coworker Wilmarie Kriel in South Africa?",
    "options": "['Lack of nutrients', 'Downy mildew (oomycete)', \"Don't know, not sure\", 'Virus', 'Phytoplasma']",

    "description": "The image shows a close-up view of a maize plant with an abnormal growth at its center. This growth appears as a dense, bushy cluster of small, green leaves or shoots, resembling a tuft of grass. The surrounding maize leaves are elongated and typical of maize plants, but the central growth stands out due to its unusual shape and density. The soil around the base of the plant is visible and appears to be dry and reddish-brown. There are no visible signs of fungal spots, powdery mildew, or other common symptoms associated with downy mildew or nutrient deficiencies. The overall appearance of the plant suggests a condition where the normal development of the maize has been disrupted, leading to the formation of this grassy-like clump."
