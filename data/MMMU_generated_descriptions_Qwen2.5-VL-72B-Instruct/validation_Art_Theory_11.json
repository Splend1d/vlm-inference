    "description": "**Image 1 Description:**\n\nThe first image is a floor plan of a large building. The layout consists of a long central rectangular area flanked by smaller rooms or spaces on both sides. The central area appears to be open, with dotted lines suggesting columns or supports. On one side of the central area, there is a semi-circular apse with a smaller rectangular space inside it. The overall structure has a symmetrical design with multiple sections connected in a linear fashion. A scale bar at the bottom indicates measurements in meters and feet, showing the building's considerable size. There is also a north arrow indicating orientation.\n\n**Image 2 Description:**\n\nThe second image is an elevation drawing of a building interior. It shows a long, covered space with a high roof supported by rows of columns. The roof has a triangular pediment at the top, and the walls have arched openings along their length. The central aisle is flanked by two rows of columns, creating a nave and side aisles typical of certain architectural styles. The far end of the space features a semi-circular apse with an arched opening. The design suggests a spacious, well-lit interior with a clear division between the central and side areas.\n\n**Combined Description for Answering the Question:**\n\nThe images depict a building with a long central space, flanked by smaller rooms or spaces, and featuring a semi-circular apse at one end. The interior has a high roof supported by columns, creating a nave and side aisles. This layout and design are characteristic of **basilicas**, which were originally public buildings used for various civic purposes but later became associated with Christian churches. The presence of the apse, the columned nave, and the overall symmetry are key features that align with basilica architecture. Therefore, the design of the church illustrated was most influenced by **C. basilicas**."
