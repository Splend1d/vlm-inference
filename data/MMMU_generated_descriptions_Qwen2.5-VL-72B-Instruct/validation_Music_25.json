    "description": "The image shows a musical staff with a treble clef at the beginning. On this staff, there are two notes: a G below the staff (with a ledger line) and an F sharp above the staff. The F sharp has a natural sign next to it, indicating that any previous accidental for F should be canceled. The interval between these two notes spans six lines and spaces, making it a sixth interval. The specific type of sixth interval can be determined by counting the semitones between the two notes. In this case, the interval is a minor sixth because it consists of eight semitones. Therefore, the correct answer is C. minor."
