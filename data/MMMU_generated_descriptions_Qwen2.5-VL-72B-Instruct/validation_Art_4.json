    "description": "The image is divided into three vertical sections, each showing the same scene but with different levels of exposure. \n\n- The left section is overexposed, making the details of the buildings and the snowy landscape almost completely washed out. The bright white dominates this part, obscuring finer details.\n  \n- The middle section appears to have balanced exposure. The details of the wooden buildings, the snow-covered ground, and the mountainous background are clearly visible. The colors and contrasts are well-defined, allowing for a clear view of the scene.\n  \n- The right section is underexposed, resulting in a darker image where the details are less visible. The buildings and landscape appear shadowed, and the overall scene lacks brightness.\n\nThe image demonstrates how exposure affects the visibility and clarity of a photograph. The differences between the three sections highlight the impact of overexposure, balanced exposure, and underexposure on the final image quality. \n\nBased on this description, the question \"What can be fixed by editing programs after it has been shot?\" can be answered as follows: D. Over and underexposure. Editing programs can adjust the exposure levels to bring back details lost due to over or underexposure, as shown in the comparison between the three sections of the image."
