    "question": "Huntington disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a degeneration of the striatum and cortex of the brain. Patients show motor abnormalities, personality changes, a gradual loss of higher brain functions, and eventually die. Below <image 1> is a family pedigree and an accompanying Southern blot that was obtained with genomic DNA that was probed with a DNA complementary to the gene for the Huntingtin protein. Based on the linked image above, which statement is most likely to be CORRECT?",
    "options": "['HD is an autosomal recessive disease', 'The huntingtin gene is likely to be located on the X-chromosome', 'A likely cause of HD is an unstable triplet repeat in the HD gene', 'The pattern of bands in the blot is indicative of abnormal splicing of the HD mRNA', 'In most individuals, the region of the HD gene detected by the DNA probe is distributed on six different restriction fragments']",

    "description": "The image consists of two main parts: a family pedigree labeled I, II, and III, and a Southern blot analysis.\n\n### Family Pedigree:\n- **Generation I:** \n  - There is one individual represented by a square (male), who appears unaffected.\n  - This individual has a child with another individual represented by a filled circle (female), who appears affected.\n  \n- **Generation II:** \n  - The offspring from Generation I includes one individual represented by a filled circle (female), who appears affected.\n  - This affected female has a child with an unaffected male (square).\n  \n- **Generation III:** \n  - The offspring from Generation II includes one individual represented by a filled square (male), who appears affected.\n\n### Southern Blot Analysis:\n- The Southern blot shows a series of horizontal lines representing DNA fragments separated by size.\n- There are multiple lanes, each corresponding to a sample from an individual in the pedigree.\n- Each lane contains several distinct bands, indicating the presence of multiple DNA fragments.\n- Notably, some lanes have additional or differently sized bands compared to others, suggesting variations in the DNA sequence or structure among the samples.\n\n### Key Observations:\n- The pedigree indicates that the disease can be passed from an affected parent to both male and female offspring, suggesting it is not sex-linked.\n- The Southern blot shows variability in band patterns, particularly in the affected individuals, which could indicate a genetic mutation or expansion associated with the disease.\n\nBased on this detailed description, the correct answer can be determined."
