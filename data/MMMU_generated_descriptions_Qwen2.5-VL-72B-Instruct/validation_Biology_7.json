    "question": "Which arrow in <image 1> points to a large ribosomal unit?",
    "options": "['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'H', 'I']",
    "id": "validation_Biology_7",
    "description": "The image depicts a diagram of a ribosome engaged in protein synthesis. The ribosome is divided into two subunits: a larger one and a smaller one. \n\n- The **larger subunit** is labeled with the letter **B**. It is positioned above the mRNA strand and appears to have a more complex structure compared to the smaller subunit.\n- The **smaller subunit** is labeled with the letter **C**. It is located below the mRNA strand and has a simpler structure.\n- The mRNA strand runs horizontally through the ribosome, with its 5' end on the left and its 3' end on the right. It is labeled with the letter **G**.\n- There are tRNA molecules (labeled **E**, **F**, and **D**) aligned along the mRNA, each carrying an amino acid.\n- The growing polypeptide chain is indicated by an arrow pointing to the right, labeled **F**.\n- Other labels include **A**, which points to a part of the larger subunit; **H**, which points to the smaller subunit near the tRNA entry site; and **I**, which points to a part of the larger subunit near the exit site for the polypeptide chain.\n\nBased on this description, the arrow that points to the large ribosomal unit is **B**."
