    "description": "The image depicts a scenario where water flows from a storm drain over an outfall onto a porous bed. The initial depth of the water as it exits the outfall is given as 40 cm. The water flows horizontally with a velocity of 2 meters per second (m/s) immediately after exiting the outfall. \n\nThe porous bed beneath the flow absorbs water uniformly at a vertical velocity of 8 millimeters per second (mm/s). The system extends 5 meters deep into the plane of the paper, indicating the width of the flow area. The length of the porous bed, denoted as \"L,\" is unknown and needs to be determined. The question asks for the length \"L\" required for the porous bed to completely absorb the stormwater. \n\nThe options provided for the length \"L\" are:\nA. 50 meters  \nB. 70 meters  \nC. 90 meters  \n\nThe image includes a diagram showing the flow direction, the initial depth of the water, the horizontal velocity of the water, and the absorption rate of the porous bed. The goal is to find the length \"L\" necessary for the entire volume of water flowing from the storm drain to be absorbed by the porous bed."
