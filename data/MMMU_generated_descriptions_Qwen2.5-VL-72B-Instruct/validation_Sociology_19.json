    "description": "The image features a group of cartoon-style characters with various hairstyles and clothing colors, arranged in a cluster. A magnifying glass is prominently placed over one character in the center, highlighting them. To the right of the characters, there is text that reads \"What is Majoritarianism?\" The background is a solid light purple color, and there is a small logo in the top right corner. The overall theme suggests an exploration or explanation of the concept of majoritarianism. \n\nThe image does not provide any specific context or examples beyond the visual representation of a group and the question about majoritarianism. There is no additional information indicating whether majoritarianism extends beyond political decisions. Therefore, based solely on this image, it is not possible to definitively determine if majoritarianism is limited to political decisions or not. \n\nGiven this description, the answer to the question would be:\n\nC. Not sure"
