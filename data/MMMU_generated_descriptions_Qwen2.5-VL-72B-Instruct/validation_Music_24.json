    "description": "The image shows a musical excerpt in the key of B-flat major, as indicated by the two flats in the key signature (B-flat and E-flat). The time signature is 2/4. There are three chords labeled A, B, and C. \n\n- Chord A consists of the notes F, A, and C in the right hand, with a B-flat in the left hand.\n- Chord B consists of the notes G, B-flat, and D in the right hand, with a G in the left hand.\n- Chord C consists of the notes B-flat, D, and F in the right hand, with a B-flat in the left hand.\n\nThe question asks for the identification of chord C in the context of the key of B-flat major. Chord C is a B-flat major triad (B-flat, D, F), which is the tonic chord (I) in the key of B-flat major. The bass note is also B-flat, which means it is in root position. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Ic"
