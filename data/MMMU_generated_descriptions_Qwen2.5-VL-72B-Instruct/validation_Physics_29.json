    "description": "The image depicts an electrical circuit consisting of resistors and an ammeter. The circuit includes:\n\n- A battery with its positive terminal on the right and negative terminal on the left.\n- Four resistors connected in a specific configuration:\n  - A 1 \u03a9 resistor is connected between the positive terminal of the battery and a junction point.\n  - A 2 \u03a9 resistor is connected between this same junction point and another junction point where the ammeter (labeled \"A\") is located.\n  - A 3 \u03a9 resistor is connected between the ammeter's other end and the negative terminal of the battery.\n  - An unknown resistor labeled \"R\" is connected between the junction points where the 2 \u03a9 and 3 \u03a9 resistors meet.\n- The ammeter is placed in the middle of the circuit, between the 2 \u03a9 and 3 \u03a9 resistors, and it is specified that the ammeter reads zero.\n\nThe goal is to determine the value of the unknown resistance \"R\" given that the ammeter reads zero."
