    "description": "The image illustrates the concept of Symbolic Interactionism with a circular diagram consisting of four key components connected by arrows indicating a cyclical relationship. The components are:\n\n1. **Society**: Positioned at the top left of the circle.\n2. **Symbols**: Positioned at the top right of the circle.\n3. **Establish meanings**: Positioned at the bottom right of the circle.\n4. **Communicate with each other**: Positioned at the bottom left of the circle.\n5. **Develop their views**: Positioned at the center bottom of the circle.\n\nThe arrows show the flow of interaction:\n- From \"Society\" to \"Symbols,\" indicating that society uses symbols.\n- From \"Symbols\" to \"Establish meanings,\" suggesting that symbols help establish meanings within society.\n- From \"Establish meanings\" to \"Communicate with each other,\" showing that established meanings facilitate communication.\n- From \"Communicate with each other\" back to \"Society,\" completing the cycle, where communication influences societal norms and views.\n\nThe central phrase \"Develop their views\" emphasizes that through this cycle, individuals and groups develop their perspectives and understanding of the world around them. \n\nThis image does not directly address social stratification or economic disparities but focuses on how symbols and communication shape societal interactions and individual viewpoints. Therefore, none of the statements A, B, C, or D about stratification are directly represented in the image."
