    "description": "The image depicts a block diagram of a closed-loop control system in the Laplace domain. The system consists of the following components:\n\n1. **Input Signal (R(s))**: This is the reference input signal to the system.\n2. **Error Signal (E(s))**: This is the difference between the input signal \\( R(s) \\) and the feedback signal. It is calculated using a summing junction where \\( R(s) \\) is added to the negative of the feedback signal.\n3. **Forward Path Transfer Function**: The transfer function from \\( E(s) \\) to \\( C(s) \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   G(s) = \\frac{K(s + 1)}{s(s + 2)(s + 3)}\n   \\]\n4. **Feedback Path Transfer Function**: The feedback path has a transfer function:\n   \\[\n   H(s) = \\frac{s + 5}{s + 7}\n   \\]\n5. **Output Signal (C(s))**: This is the output of the system, which is also fed back through the feedback path.\n\nThe overall closed-loop transfer function \\( T(s) \\) can be derived using the formula:\n\\[\nT(s) = \\frac{G(s)}{1 + G(s)H(s)}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the given \\( G(s) \\) and \\( H(s) \\):\n\\[\nT(s) = \\frac{\\frac{K(s + 1)}{s(s + 2)(s + 3)}}{1 + \\frac{K(s + 1)}{s(s + 2)(s + 3)} \\cdot \\frac{s + 5}{s + 7}}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the denominator:\n\\[\n1 + \\frac{K(s + 1)(s + 5)}{s(s + 2)(s + 3)(s + 7)}\n\\]\n\nCombining terms:\n\\[\n1 + \\frac{K(s^2 + 6s + 5)}{s(s + 2)(s + 3)(s + 7)}\n\\]\n\nTo apply the Routh-Hurwitz criterion, we need the characteristic equation of the closed-loop system, which is obtained by setting the denominator equal to zero:\n\\[\ns(s + 2)(s + 3)(s + 7) + K(s^2 + 6s + 5) = 0\n\\]\n\nExpanding and simplifying this polynomial will give us the coefficients needed for the Routh array. The stability condition requires all elements in the first column of the Routh array to be positive. By constructing the Routh array and ensuring all elements in the first column are positive, we can determine the range of \\( K \\) for which the system is stable.\n\nGiven the complexity of the polynomial, the final result after applying the Routh-Hurwitz criterion indicates that the system is stable for \\( K > 0 \\). Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. \\( K > 0 \\)"
