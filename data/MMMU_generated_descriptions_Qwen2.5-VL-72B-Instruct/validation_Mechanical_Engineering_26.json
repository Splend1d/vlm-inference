    "description": "The image displays four different diagrams labeled a), b), c), and d), each illustrating a threaded connection between two components. The threads are represented by diagonal lines within the cylindrical sections of the components.\n\n- **a)**: Shows a threaded connection where the external thread (on the protruding part) and the internal thread (in the hole) are aligned correctly. The threads appear to match properly for engagement.\n  \n- **b)**: Depicts a similar threaded connection as in a), but with an additional feature: a small rectangular section is shown at the end of the internal thread, indicating a chamfer or counterbore. This is a common practice to ease the insertion of the external thread into the internal thread.\n  \n- **c)**: Displays a threaded connection where the external thread and the internal thread do not align correctly. The external thread appears to be too short or improperly positioned relative to the internal thread, suggesting that they would not engage properly.\n  \n- **d)**: Similar to a) and b), this diagram shows a threaded connection where the external and internal threads are aligned correctly for proper engagement. There is no additional feature like the chamfer seen in b).\n\nBased on these descriptions, the thread labeling method that is incorrect is:\n\n**C. C**"
