    "description": "The image illustrates a scenario labeled \"Case 1: Low (work) income.\" It depicts a graph with two axes: \"Income\" on the vertical axis and \"Leisure time\" on the horizontal axis. The horizontal axis also includes a label for \"Work,\" which is represented by an arrow pointing left from the origin, indicating that more work corresponds to less leisure time. The total time available is indicated as 24 hours.\n\nThere are two indifference curves (IC 1 and IC 2) shown on the graph. These curves represent combinations of income and leisure time that provide the same level of satisfaction to the individual. The budget constraint line intersects these indifference curves at points 'a' and 'b'. Point 'a' lies on IC 2, while point 'b' lies on IC 1. Point 'a' is closer to the origin than point 'b', suggesting a lower level of income but more leisure time.\n\nThe graph shows that the worker's optimal choice is at point 'a', where they have more leisure time and less income compared to point 'b'. At point 'a', the amount of leisure time is clearly marked as 24 hours minus the time spent working. The time spent working is not explicitly stated, but it is evident that the worker has chosen to allocate all 24 hours to leisure time, as there is no indication of any work hours.\n\nBased on this description, the worker in Case 1 would choose:\n\nA. Leisure time is 24 hours."
