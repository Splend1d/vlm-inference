    "question": "<image 1> Baxter Company has a relevant range of production between 15,000 and 30,000 units. The following cost data represents average variable costs per unit for 25,000 units of production. If 15,000 units are produced, what are the per unit manufacturing overhead costs incurred?",
    "options": "['$10', '$11', '$12', '$13']",
    "id": "validation_Accounting_19",
    "description": "The image presents a table detailing the average cost per unit for various cost categories in the production process. The table lists the following items along with their respective average costs:\n\n- **Direct materials:** $10 per unit\n- **Direct labor:** $9 per unit\n- **Indirect materials:** $3 per unit\n- **Fixed manufacturing overhead:** $6 per unit\n- **Variable manufacturing overhead:** $2 per unit\n- **Fixed selling and administrative expenses:** $8 per unit\n- **Variable sales commissions:** $14 per unit\n\nThe question pertains to calculating the per-unit manufacturing overhead costs when 15,000 units are produced. To solve this, one must consider both fixed and variable manufacturing overhead costs. The fixed manufacturing overhead remains constant at $6 per unit regardless of the production volume within the relevant range. The variable manufacturing overhead is $2 per unit. Therefore, the total manufacturing overhead cost per unit is the sum of these two components: $6 (fixed) + $2 (variable) = $8 per unit. \n\nThus, the correct answer is not listed among the provided options A ($10), B ($11), C ($12), or D ($13). The accurate per-unit manufacturing overhead cost is $8."
