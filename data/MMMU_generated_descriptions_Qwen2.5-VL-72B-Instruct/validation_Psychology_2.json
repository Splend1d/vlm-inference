    "question": "To investigate people's ability to divide their attention between two different tasks, college students were asked to listen to a passage of expository prose and at the same time to inspect a set of photographs, unrelated to the passage, that were projected one by one at a rapid rate. At the end of the dual-task presentation, the students were tested both for their memory of the passage and their memory of the photographs. To establish a baseline for this dual-task condition, the same students also were tested for their memory when each of the component tasks was presented alone. The following graph shows the results. <image 1> In a study of the effectiveness of divided attention, it is most important that the experimental design include",
    "options": "['a counterbalance of the order in which participants are tested in the baseline and dual-task conditions', 'a consistent order in which participants are tested in the baseline and dual-task conditions', 'an equal number of men and women as participants', 'verification that participants believe themselves capable of dividing attention']",

    "description": "The image is a bar graph illustrating the results of a study comparing memory performance under dual-task and single-task (baseline) conditions. The x-axis represents the \"Type of Memory,\" with two categories: \"Prose\" and \"Photograph.\" The y-axis indicates the \"Percent Correct,\" ranging from 0 to 75%.\n\nThere are four bars in total:\n\n1. For \"Prose\":\n   - A white bar labeled \"Dual-task condition\" reaches approximately 25%.\n   - A striped bar labeled \"Baseline (single-task) condition\" also reaches approximately 25%.\n\n2. For \"Photograph\":\n   - A white bar labeled \"Dual-task condition\" reaches approximately 60%.\n   - A striped bar labeled \"Baseline (single-task) condition\" reaches approximately 75%.\n\nThe legend at the bottom clarifies that:\n- White bars represent the \"Dual-task condition.\"\n- Striped bars represent the \"Baseline (single-task) condition.\"\n\nThe graph demonstrates that memory performance for both prose and photographs is lower in the dual-task condition compared to the baseline condition. However, the difference is more pronounced for photographs than for prose. This suggests that dividing attention has a greater impact on visual memory (photographs) than on auditory memory (prose). \n\nThe question asks about the importance of certain factors in the experimental design of a study investigating divided attention. Based on the graph, the focus is on ensuring that the comparison between dual-task and baseline conditions is fair and unbiased. Therefore, the most critical aspect would be related to the order in which participants are tested in these conditions."
