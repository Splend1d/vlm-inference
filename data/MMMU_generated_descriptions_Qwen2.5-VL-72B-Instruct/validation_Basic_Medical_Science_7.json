The table includes four rows, each representing a different vital sign:\n\n1. **Temperature**: The temperature is recorded as 39.2\u00b0C (102.5\u00b0F).\n2. **Blood pressure**: The blood pressure is noted as 100/70 mmHg.\n3. **Heart rate**: The heart rate is documented as 120 beats per minute.\n4. **Respiratory rate**: The respiratory rate is listed as 28 breaths per minute.\n\nThese values indicate that the patient has an elevated temperature (fever), which is consistent with the symptoms described in the question. The other vital signs are within ranges that could be associated with a febrile illness."
