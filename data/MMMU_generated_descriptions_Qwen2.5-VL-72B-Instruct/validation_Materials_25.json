    "description": "The image presents a table with two columns and three rows. The first column header reads \"\u03c1 (g/cm\u00b3)\" which represents density in grams per cubic centimeter. The second column header reads \"crystallinity (%)\" indicating the percentage of crystallinity. \n\nIn the data rows:\n\n- The first row shows a density value of 0.904 g/cm\u00b3 paired with a crystallinity of 62.8%.\n- The second row shows a density value of 0.895 g/cm\u00b3 paired with a crystallinity of 54.4%.\n\nThis table provides the necessary data to calculate the density of totally amorphous polypropylene using the given density and crystallinity values."
