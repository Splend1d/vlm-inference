    "description": "The image depicts an AC circuit with various components connected in series and parallel. Here's a detailed description:\n\n- **Voltage Source**: There is a voltage source labeled \\( 25 \\cos(250t) \\) V.\n- **Resistors**: \n  - A 5\u03a9 resistor is connected directly to the voltage source.\n  - Another 15\u03a9 resistor is part of a parallel branch containing an inductor and this resistor.\n- **Capacitor**: A 200\u03bcF capacitor is connected in parallel with the 60V DC voltage source.\n- **Inductor**: An 80mH inductor is in series with the 15\u03a9 resistor.\n- **Current Source**: An 8A current source is also present in the circuit, connected in parallel with the inductor and 15\u03a9 resistor.\n- **Nodes and Voltages**:\n  - The voltage across the inductor and 15\u03a9 resistor combination is labeled \\( v_2 \\).\n  - The current through the inductor and 15\u03a9 resistor combination is labeled \\( i_1 \\).\n\nThe circuit is driven by both an AC voltage source and a DC voltage source, and there is a current source affecting the parallel branch. The goal is to find the voltage \\( v_2 \\) across the inductor and 15\u03a9 resistor combination. \n\nTo solve for \\( v_2 \\), one would need to analyze the circuit using AC steady-state analysis techniques, considering the impedance of the inductor at the given frequency (250 rad/s), and the effects of the current source and the parallel capacitor. The solution involves calculating the phasor representation of the voltages and currents, taking into account the phase shifts introduced by the reactive components."
