    "question": "A survey line ABC crossing a river at right angles cut its banks at B and C, as shown in Fig. 2.39. To determine the width BC of the river, the following operation was carried out.A 60 m long line BE was set out roughly parallel to the river. Line CE was extended to D and mid-point F of DB was established. Then EF was extended to G such that FG = EF. Line DG was extended to cut the survey line ABC at H. GH and HB were measured and found to be 40 m and 80 m, respectively.Find the width of the river.<image 1>",

    "description": "The image depicts a geometric diagram used for determining the width of a river using surveying techniques. The key elements and measurements are as follows:\n\n- A straight line labeled **ABC** represents the survey line that crosses the river at right angles. Points **B** and **C** mark where this line intersects the riverbanks.\n- A horizontal line segment **BE**, measuring **60 meters**, is drawn roughly parallel to the riverbank from point **B**.\n- Point **E** lies on an extension of line **CE**, which is further extended to point **D**.\n- Point **F** is the midpoint of line segment **DB**.\n- Line **EF** is extended to point **G** such that **FG** equals **EF**.\n- Line **DG** is then extended to intersect the survey line **ABC** at point **H**.\n- The distances **GH** and **HB** are given as **40 meters** and **80 meters**, respectively.\n\nThe goal is to find the width of the river, represented by the distance **BC**. The relationships between the points and lines suggest the use of similar triangles or proportional segments to solve for the unknown width."
