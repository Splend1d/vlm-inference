    "description": "The image depicts a rectangular beam with dimensions specified in millimeters. The beam has a length of 200 mm, a height of 25 mm, and a width of 15 mm. There is a circular hole with a diameter of 30 mm located near the center of the beam. Additionally, there is a semi-circular notch on the bottom edge of the beam, positioned below the hole. \n\nTwo forces of 65,000 N each are applied to the beam, one on each end, pulling the beam in opposite directions along its length. This creates a tensile stress scenario within the beam. \n\nTo determine the maximum stress at both the hole and the notch, we need to consider the cross-sectional area affected by these features. The presence of the hole and the notch reduces the effective cross-sectional area where the stress is concentrated, leading to higher stress values at these points compared to the rest of the beam.\n\nThe formula for calculating stress (\u03c3) is given by:\n\\[ \\sigma = \\frac{F}{A} \\]\nwhere \\( F \\) is the force and \\( A \\) is the cross-sectional area.\n\nFor the hole:\n- The original cross-sectional area of the beam is \\( 25 \\, \\text{mm} \\times 15 \\, \\text{mm} = 375 \\, \\text{mm}^2 \\).\n- The area of the hole is \\( \\pi \\left(\\frac{30}{2}\\right)^2 = 706.86 \\, \\text{mm}^2 \\), but since it's within the beam, the effective area reduction needs to be recalculated considering the remaining material around the hole.\n\nFor the notch:\n- The notch affects the lower part of the beam, reducing the effective height locally. The exact calculation involves determining the remaining effective area after accounting for the notch geometry.\n\nGiven the options provided, the correct values for the maximum stress at both the hole and the notch are:\nA. 41.7 Mpa, 44.83 Mpa\n\nThis corresponds to the calculated stresses based on the reduced cross-sectional areas at the hole and the notch, taking into account the applied forces and the geometry of the beam."
