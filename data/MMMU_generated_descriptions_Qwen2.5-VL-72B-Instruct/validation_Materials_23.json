    "description": "The image depicts a concrete pipe suspended by two cables, AB and AC, which are attached to a hook at point A. The pipe has a center of mass labeled as point G. The angle between cable AB and the vertical line AG is 30 degrees, while the angle between cable AC and the vertical line AG is 45 degrees. The pipe is horizontally oriented, and its ends are connected to the cables via loops or hooks at points B and C. The weight of the pipe is given as 2 Mg (megagrams), which is equivalent to 2000 kg. The diameter of cable AC is specified as 10 mm. The task is to determine the diameter of cable AB such that the average normal stress developed in cable AB is the same as in cable AC. The options for the diameter of cable AB are: A. 10.9 mm, B. 11.1 mm, C. 19.9 mm, and D. 11.9 mm."
