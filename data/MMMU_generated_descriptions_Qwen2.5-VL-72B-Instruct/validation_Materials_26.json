    "description": "The image depicts a rectangular block subjected to two equal and opposite forces of 500 lb each, acting along its centroidal axis. These forces are applied horizontally, one pulling to the left and the other pulling to the right. The block is divided by a diagonal plane labeled \"a-a,\" which passes through a specific point denoted as \"A.\" This plane forms an angle of 30 degrees with the horizontal.\n\nThe block is further divided into two sections by this plane, with the upper section labeled \"a\" and the lower section labeled \"b.\" The plane \"a-a\" is inclined at 30 degrees relative to the horizontal direction. The forces are applied symmetrically on either side of the block, ensuring equilibrium.\n\nTo determine the resultant internal normal (Na) and shear (Va) forces at section \"a-a,\" we need to consider the components of the applied forces along and perpendicular to the inclined plane. Since the forces are applied along the centroidal axis and are equal and opposite, they create a state of tension or compression along the axis but no shear component along the axis itself.\n\nGiven the symmetry and the fact that the forces are applied along the centroidal axis, the normal force (Na) at section \"a-a\" will be equal to the applied force of 500 lb, as there is no component of the force perpendicular to the axis that would cause shear. Therefore, the shear force (Va) will be zero.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Na=500 lb, Va=0"
