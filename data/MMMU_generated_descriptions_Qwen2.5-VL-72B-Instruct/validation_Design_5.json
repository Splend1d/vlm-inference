    "question": "The work (<image 1>) has been interpreted as a visual document of all of the following EXCEPT",
    "options": "['marriage', 'betrothal', 'coronation', 'legal contract']",
    "id": "validation_Design_5",
    "description": "The image depicts a painting featuring two individuals in an indoor setting. The man on the left is dressed in a dark, fur-lined robe with a wide-brimmed hat, while the woman on the right wears a green dress with a white headdress. They are holding hands, which suggests a formal agreement or union. The room is richly decorated with a chandelier, a mirror, and various household items. A small dog stands between them on the floor, and there are shoes placed near the man's feet. The overall composition and attire suggest a scene of significant importance, likely related to a personal or legal agreement. There are no elements in the image that indicate a coronation ceremony, such as crowns, scepters, or regal symbols typically associated with royal investiture. The presence of the couple holding hands and the domestic setting imply a more intimate and personal event rather than a public coronation."
