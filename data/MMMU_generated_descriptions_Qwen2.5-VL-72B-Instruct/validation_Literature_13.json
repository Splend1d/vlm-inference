    "description": "The image depicts a red hardcover book standing upright on a surface with a textured background. The book has a visible spine and front cover. On the spine, the words \"READ ME\" are written vertically in white text. The front cover features the phrase \"DON'T JUDGE ME\" in bold, capitalized letters near the top. Below this text, there is an illustration of a face with a large nose, a single yellow eye, and a wide, toothy grin. Two small black birds are flying above the text. The book appears to have a sturdy construction, typical of books with hard covers, which are designed to protect the pages inside and allow the book to stand upright on a shelf. The material of the cover looks like it could be cardboard or a similar rigid substance, which is common for book covers. \n\nThe question asks about the term referring to the two boards that make the book more durable and allow it to stand on a shelf. Based on the description, these boards are part of the book's structure and are known as \"covers.\" Therefore, the correct answer is D. Covers."
