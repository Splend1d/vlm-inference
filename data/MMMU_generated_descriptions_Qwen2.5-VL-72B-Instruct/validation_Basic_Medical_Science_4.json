    "description": "The image shows a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain in a coronal section. The scan highlights a region near the base of the brain where there appears to be a mass or abnormality. This mass is indicated by an arrow pointing to a well-defined area with increased signal intensity compared to the surrounding tissue. The location of this mass is close to the internal auditory canal, which houses the vestibulocochlear nerve (cranial nerve VIII). The mass seems to be exerting pressure on structures within this region. There are no visible abnormalities affecting the facial nerve (cranial nerve VII), which is responsible for facial sensation and motor control of the face. The mass appears to be isolated to the area associated with the vestibulocochlear nerve."
