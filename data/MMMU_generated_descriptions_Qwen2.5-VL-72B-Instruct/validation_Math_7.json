    "description": "The image displays six examples of contra dance figures, each labeled from Example (1) to Example (6). Each example shows stick figures representing dancers, with arrows indicating their movements. The figures are color-coded: red for women and blue for men, with pink used for intermediate positions or additional dancers.\n\n- **Example (1)**: Shows four dancers forming a circle. The arrows indicate they are moving clockwise around the circle.\n- **Example (2)**: Depicts two pairs of dancers facing each other. The arrows show the women moving to the right and passing behind the men, then turning to face their original partners.\n- **Example (3)**: Displays two pairs of dancers facing each other. The arrows indicate the men are swinging with the women on their sides.\n- **Example (4)**: Shows two pairs of dancers facing each other. The arrows show the men moving to the right and passing behind the women, then turning to face their original partners.\n- **Example (5)**: Depicts two pairs of dancers facing each other. The arrows indicate the dancers are moving through each other, with the men passing left shoulders and the women passing right shoulders.\n- **Example (6)**: Shows two pairs of dancers facing each other. The arrows indicate the men are moving to the right and passing behind the women, then turning to face their original partners, similar to Example (2) but with a different final position.\n\nBased on these descriptions, the correct sequence matching the contra dance figures with the examples is:\n\nA. (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6)  \nB. (1), (3), (4), (5), (2), (6)  \nC. (1), (3), (5), (2), (4), (6)  \nD. (1), (3), (5), (6), (2), (4)  \n\nThe correct answer is C. (1), (3), (5), (2), (4), (6)."
