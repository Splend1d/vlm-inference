    "description": "The image is a line graph titled \"PERCENTAGE OF VILLAGES DEPOPULATED IN THE WESTERN ROMAN EMPIRE, 400 TO 500 C.E.\" The x-axis represents time, labeled \"By 400 C.E.\" and \"By 500 C.E.\" The y-axis represents the percentage of villages depopulated, ranging from 0% to 100%. \n\nThere are six lines representing different regions within the Western Roman Empire: Italy, South Gaul, South Spain, North Spain, Britain, Belgica, and North Gaul. Each line shows a downward trend, indicating an increase in the percentage of depopulated villages over the 100-year period.\n\n- **Italy**: Starts at approximately 20% depopulated by 400 C.E. and decreases slightly to around 18% by 500 C.E.\n- **South Gaul**: Begins at about 20% and drops to roughly 35%.\n- **South Spain**: Starts at around 20% and decreases to about 40%.\n- **North Spain**: Begins at approximately 20% and drops to around 45%.\n- **Britain**: Starts at about 20% and decreases to around 50%.\n- **Belgica**: Begins at around 20% and drops to about 70%.\n- **North Gaul**: Starts at approximately 20% and decreases sharply to nearly 100%.\n\nThe graph illustrates a significant increase in village depopulation across all regions, with North Gaul experiencing the most dramatic decline. The trend suggests a widespread and severe impact on rural populations throughout the Western Roman Empire during this period."
