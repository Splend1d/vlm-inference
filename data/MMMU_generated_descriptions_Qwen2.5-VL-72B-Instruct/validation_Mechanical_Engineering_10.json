    "description": "The image depicts a composite bimetallic bar consisting of two materials: steel and aluminum. The bar has a rectangular cross-section with dimensions specified as follows:\n\n- The total width (along the x-axis) of the bar is 2 cm.\n- The height (along the y-axis) of the bar is 0.5 cm.\n- The length of the bar (along the z-axis, perpendicular to the plane of the image) is 0.5 m.\n\nThe bar is divided into two sections along its height:\n- The top section is made of steel, occupying the upper half of the height (0.25 cm).\n- The bottom section is made of aluminum, occupying the lower half of the height (0.25 cm).\n\nThe Young's modulus (E) for each material is provided:\n- For steel: \\( E_{\\text{steel}} = 207 \\times 10^9 \\) Pa.\n- For aluminum: \\( E_{\\text{aluminum}} = 83 \\times 10^9 \\) Pa.\n\nThe problem involves finding the equivalent spring constant (\\( k_{\\text{eq}} \\)) of this bimetallic bar in axial motion. The options given for \\( k_{\\text{eq}} \\) are:\nA. \\( k_{\\text{eq}} = 4.80 \\times 10^7 \\frac{N}{m} \\)\nB. \\( k_{\\text{eq}} = 5.80 \\times 10^7 \\frac{N}{m} \\)\nC. \\( k_{\\text{eq}} = 6.80 \\times 10^7 \\frac{N}{m} \\)\n\nTo solve this, one would need to calculate the individual stiffnesses of the steel and aluminum sections and then combine them appropriately to find the equivalent stiffness of the entire bar."
