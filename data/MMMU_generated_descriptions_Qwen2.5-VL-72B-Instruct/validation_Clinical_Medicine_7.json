    "question": "A 29-year-old G3 P2 woman has an uncomplicated pregnancy, and an ultrasound scan at 18 weeks gestation is completely normal. At 37 weeks she has the sudden onset of pelvic pain accompanied by passage of blood per vagina. Her membranes have not ruptured nor is she having labor contractions. Fetal monitoring reveals that the baby is in distress, and an emergent cesarean section is performed. The gross appearance of the placenta is shown here. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? <image 1> ",
    "options": "['Ectopic pregnancy', 'Placenta previa', 'Placenta accreta', 'Molar pregnancy', 'Abruptio placenta', 'Pregnancy-induced hypertension']",

    "description": "The image shows a portion of a placenta with a significant area of dark, clotted blood adhering to its surface. The blood appears to have originated from within the placental tissue rather than from the surface. There is a visible disruption in the placental structure, suggesting that part of the placenta has separated from the uterine wall. The surrounding placental tissue looks relatively normal, but the area affected by the bleeding is prominent and extensive. The green background contrasts sharply with the red and dark hues of the blood and placental tissue, highlighting the abnormality. \n\nBased on this description, the most likely diagnosis is:\n\nE. Abruptio placenta\n\nAbruptio placenta is characterized by the premature separation of a normally implanted placenta from the uterine wall, which can cause internal bleeding and lead to fetal distress, matching the clinical scenario described. The other options do not fit the described clinical presentation and gross appearance of the placenta."
