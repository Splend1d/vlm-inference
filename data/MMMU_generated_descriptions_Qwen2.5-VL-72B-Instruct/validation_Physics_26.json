    "question": "<image 1>Given the graph of the velocity vs. time of a duck flying due south for the winter. At what point did the duck stop its forward motion?",
    "options": "['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']",

    "description": "The image is a line graph depicting velocity versus time. The x-axis represents time, while the y-axis represents velocity. The graph shows a curve with four labeled points: A, B, C, and D.\n\n- Point A is located on an upward-sloping section of the curve, indicating increasing velocity over time.\n- Point B is at the peak of the curve, where the velocity reaches its maximum value before starting to decrease.\n- Point C is on a downward-sloping section of the curve, showing a decrease in velocity.\n- Point D is at the very end of the curve, where the velocity drops to zero.\n\nThe question asks at which point the duck stopped its forward motion. Since stopping means the velocity becomes zero, the correct answer would be the point where the velocity reaches zero. Based on the description, this occurs at Point D."
