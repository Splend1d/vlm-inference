    "description": "The image illustrates the stages of a bacteriophage infection within a host bacterial cell. The process is depicted in five sequential steps labeled A through E.\n\n- **Step A**: This shows a bacteriophage attaching to the surface of a host bacterial cell. The phage DNA is visible outside the cell, indicating it has not yet entered.\n  \n- **Step B**: Here, the phage DNA has penetrated into the host bacterial cell, mixing with the host's DNA. The bacteriophage itself remains attached to the outside of the cell.\n\n- **Step C**: In this stage, the phage DNA replicates within the host cell. Multiple copies of the phage DNA are shown, indicating biosynthesis. The host DNA is still present but overshadowed by the replication of phage DNA.\n\n- **Step D**: New bacteriophages begin to form inside the host cell. These newly assembled phages are visible alongside the replicated phage DNA.\n\n- **Step E**: The final step shows new phage particles exiting the host bacterial cell. This indicates the lysis of the host cell, releasing the newly formed bacteriophages.\n\nBased on this description, stage C in the figure corresponds to the replication of phage DNA within the host cell, which is part of the biosynthesis phase of the bacteriophage infection cycle. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. Biosynthesis**."
