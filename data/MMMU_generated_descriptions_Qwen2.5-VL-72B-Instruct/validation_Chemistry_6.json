    "description": "The image is a phase diagram with two axes: \"Temperature\" on the horizontal axis and \"Pressure\" on the vertical axis. The diagram shows a curved line that separates different phases of a substance. This line starts at a high pressure and low temperature (point 1), curves downward to a minimum point (point 7), and then curves upward again to a higher temperature and pressure (point 5). \n\nThere are nine labeled points on the graph:\n\n- Point 1 is located at the upper left corner, indicating a high pressure and low temperature.\n- Point 2 is below point 1, indicating a lower pressure and similar temperature.\n- Point 3 is along the curve between points 1 and 7, indicating a decreasing pressure and increasing temperature.\n- Point 4 is above the curve, indicating a higher pressure and temperature than point 3 but not on the curve.\n- Point 5 is at the upper right corner, indicating a high pressure and high temperature.\n- Point 6 is along the curve between points 7 and 5, indicating an increasing pressure and temperature.\n- Point 7 is the lowest point on the curve, indicating a specific pressure and temperature where the curve changes direction.\n- Point 8 is below the curve, indicating a lower pressure and temperature than point 7.\n- Point 9 is below the curve and to the right of point 7, indicating a higher temperature and lower pressure than point 7.\n\nThe curve represents the boundary between different phases of the substance, and the points on the curve represent conditions where two phases are in equilibrium. The melting/freezing equilibrium typically occurs at the lowest point on the curve, which is point 7. Therefore, the correct answer is E. 7 and 8."
