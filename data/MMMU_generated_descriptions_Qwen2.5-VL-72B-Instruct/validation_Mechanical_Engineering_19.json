    "description": "The problem involves two scenarios with a mass \\( m \\) attached to springs of varying lengths and stiffnesses.\n\n### Image 1:\n- A single helical spring of stiffness \\( k \\) is cut into two equal halves.\n- Each half has a length \\( \\frac{l}{2} \\).\n- These two halves are connected in parallel to a mass \\( m \\), which is placed between them.\n- The natural time period of this system is given as \\( 0.5 \\) seconds.\n\n### Image 2:\n- An identical spring (same original stiffness \\( k \\)) is cut into two unequal parts.\n- One part has a length \\( \\frac{l}{4} \\) and the other part has a length \\( \\frac{3l}{4} \\).\n- These two parts are also connected in parallel to the same mass \\( m \\).\n\n### Key Points:\n- In both images, the mass \\( m \\) is connected to the springs in parallel.\n- The stiffness of a spring is inversely proportional to its length. Therefore, if a spring of length \\( l \\) has stiffness \\( k \\):\n  - A spring of length \\( \\frac{l}{2} \\) will have stiffness \\( 2k \\).\n  - A spring of length \\( \\frac{l}{4} \\) will have stiffness \\( 4k \\).\n  - A spring of length \\( \\frac{3l}{4} \\) will have stiffness \\( \\frac{4k}{3} \\).\n\n### Calculation for Image 1:\n- Two springs each with stiffness \\( 2k \\) are in parallel.\n- The equivalent stiffness \\( k_{eq1} \\) is \\( 2k + 2k = 4k \\).\n- The natural time period \\( T_1 \\) is given by:\n  \\[\n  T_1 = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{m}{k_{eq1}}} = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{m}{4k}} = 0.5 \\text{ s}\n  \\]\n\n### Calculation for Image 2:\n- Springs with stiffness \\( 4k \\) and \\( \\frac{4k}{3} \\) are in parallel.\n- The equivalent stiffness \\( k_{eq2} \\) is \\( 4k + \\frac{4k}{3} = \\frac{16k}{3} \\).\n- The natural time period \\( T_2 \\) is:\n  \\[\n  T_2 = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{m}{k_{eq2}}} = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{m}{\\frac{16k}{3}}} = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{3m}{16k}}\n  \\]\n- Using the relation from Image 1: \\( 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{m}{4k}} = 0.5 \\):\n  \\[\n  T_2 = 0.5 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{4}} = 0.5 \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\approx 0.433 \\text{ s}\n  \\]\n\nThus, the natural period of the system in Image 2 is approximately \\( 0.433 \\) seconds. The correct answer is:\n\n**B. \\( (\\tau_{n})_{2} = 0.433 \\) s**."
