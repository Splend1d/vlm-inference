    "description": "The image depicts a common-collector amplifier circuit, also known as an emitter follower. The components and their values are as follows:\n\n- A transistor (NPN type) with a beta (\\(\\beta\\)) value of 50 and an internal resistance \\(r_e'\\) of 50 \u03a9.\n- A power supply voltage of -10 V connected to the collector through a resistor \\(R_B\\) of 470 k\u03a9.\n- An input signal source \\(E_s\\) connected to the base of the transistor through a coupling capacitor \\(C_c\\) and a resistor \\(R_S\\) of 650 \u03a9.\n- A resistor \\(R_E\\) of 5.6 k\u03a9 connected between the emitter and ground.\n- Another coupling capacitor \\(C_c\\) connected between the emitter and the output voltage \\(V_{out}\\) (ac).\n- The input voltage \\(V_{in}\\) is applied at the base-emitter junction.\n- The output voltage \\(V_{out}\\) (ac) is taken from the emitter terminal.\n\nTo find the output resistance \\(r_{out}\\) for this common-collector amplifier, you need to consider the small-signal equivalent circuit. In a common-collector configuration, the output resistance \\(r_{out}\\) is approximately equal to the emitter resistor \\(R_E\\) divided by the factor \\((\\beta + 1)\\), where \\(\\beta\\) is the current gain of the transistor. Given \\(\\beta = 50\\), the calculation would involve these values."
