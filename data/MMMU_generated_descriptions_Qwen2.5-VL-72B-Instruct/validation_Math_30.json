    "description": "The image shows a square \\(ABCD\\) with side length 1. Points \\(P\\), \\(Q\\), \\(R\\), and \\(S\\) are located on the sides of the square such that they form an equilateral convex hexagon \\(APQCRS\\) with side length \\(s\\). Specifically:\n\n- Point \\(P\\) lies on side \\(AB\\).\n- Point \\(Q\\) lies on side \\(BC\\).\n- Point \\(R\\) lies on side \\(CD\\).\n- Point \\(S\\) lies on side \\(DA\\).\n\nThe hexagon \\(APQCRS\\) is composed of four equilateral triangles and two right triangles. The side lengths of the hexagon are all equal to \\(s\\). The points divide the sides of the square in such a way that the distances between them form equilateral triangles.\n\nTo find the side length \\(s\\), we need to consider the geometry of the square and the hexagon. Since the hexagon is equilateral and fits within the square, the side length \\(s\\) must satisfy the condition that the sum of the segments along the sides of the square equals the side length of the square.\n\nBy analyzing the geometry, we can see that the side length \\(s\\) of the hexagon is related to the side length of the square by the equation derived from the Pythagorean theorem and the properties of the equilateral triangles. After solving the geometric relationships, we find that the side length \\(s\\) is given by:\n\n\\[ s = 2 - \\sqrt{2} \\]\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{2 - \\sqrt{2}}\n\\]"
