    "question": "Timpco, a retailer, makes both cash and credit sales (i.e., sales on open account). Information regarding budgeted sales for the last quarter of the year is as follows: <image 1> Past experience shows that 5 percent of credit sales are uncollectible. Of the credit sales that are collectible, 60 percent are collected in the month of sale; the remaining 40 percent are collected in the month following the month of sale. Customers are granted a 1.5 percent discount for payment within 10 days of billing. Approximately 75 percent of collectible credit sales take advantage of the cash discount. Inventory purchases each month are 100 percent of the cost of the following month's projected sales. (The gross profit rate for Timpco is approximately 30 percent.) All merchandise purchases are made on credit, with 25 percent paid in the month of purchase and the remainder paid in the following month. No cash discounts for early payment are available.
