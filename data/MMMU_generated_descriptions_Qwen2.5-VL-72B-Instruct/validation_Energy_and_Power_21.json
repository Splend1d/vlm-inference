    "description": "The image depicts a simplified diagram of a blimp cruising at sea level. The blimp is oriented horizontally with its nose pointing to the left and its tail to the right. The diagram includes the following details:\n\n- The blimp's speed is indicated as 75 miles per hour.\n- There are two labeled points on the blimp: \"NOSE\" on the front and \"SIDE\" on the side of the blimp.\n- An arrow points from the \"SIDE\" label to the \"NOSE\" label, indicating a direction of measurement for pressure difference.\n- The differential pressure (\\(\\Delta p\\)) between the nose and the side of the blimp is given as 950 Pascals (Pa).\n- The blimp is shown cruising at sea level, which implies standard atmospheric conditions at sea level.\n\nThe question asks for an estimate of the absolute pressure at the nose of the blimp, given the differential pressure and the cruising conditions. The options provided for the absolute pressure at the nose are:\nA. 110,000 Pa\nB. 102,000 Pa\nC. 98,000 Pa\n\nTo solve this problem, one would need to consider the standard atmospheric pressure at sea level and add the differential pressure to it. Standard atmospheric pressure at sea level is approximately 101,325 Pa. Adding the differential pressure of 950 Pa to this value gives an estimated absolute pressure at the nose."
