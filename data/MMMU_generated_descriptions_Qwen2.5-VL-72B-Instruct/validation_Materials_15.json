    "description": "The provided images consist of two parts: a table and a graph.\n\n**Table Description:**\nThe table lists temperatures in degrees Celsius (\u00b0C) alongside their corresponding impact energy values in joules (J). The temperatures range from -25\u00b0C to -175\u00b0C, decreasing in increments of approximately 25\u00b0C. The associated impact energies decrease as the temperature decreases:\n\n- At -25\u00b0C, the impact energy is 124 J.\n- At -50\u00b0C, it is 123 J.\n- At -75\u00b0C, it is 115 J.\n- At -85\u00b0C, it is 100 J.\n- At -100\u00b0C, it is 73 J.\n- At -110\u00b0C, it is 52 J.\n- At -125\u00b0C, it is 26 J.\n- At -150\u00b0C, it is 9 J.\n- At -175\u00b0C, it is 6 J.\n\n**Graph Description:**\nThe graph plots the relationship between temperature (in \u00b0C) on the x-axis and impact energy (in J) on the y-axis. The curve shows a clear trend where the impact energy increases sharply as the temperature rises. The curve flattens out at higher temperatures, indicating a plateau in impact energy.\n\nKey points on the graph:\n- At around -175\u00b0C, the impact energy is close to 6 J.\n- At around -150\u00b0C, it is about 9 J.\n- At around -125\u00b0C, it is roughly 26 J.\n- At around -110\u00b0C, it is approximately 52 J.\n- At around -100\u00b0C, it is about 73 J.\n- At around -85\u00b0C, it is close to 100 J.\n- At around -75\u00b0C, it is approximately 115 J.\n- At around -50\u00b0C, it is about 123 J.\n- At around -25\u00b0C, it is close to 124 J.\n\nThe graph also includes horizontal dashed lines at 80 J and 60 J, intersecting with vertical dashed lines at approximately -100\u00b0C and -110\u00b0C, respectively. These intersections highlight specific points on the curve.\n\n**Relevant Information for the Question:**\nTo determine the ductile-to-brittle transition temperature using the given method, calculate the average of the maximum and minimum impact energies. From the table/graph:\n- Maximum impact energy is 124 J (at -25\u00b0C).\n- Minimum impact energy is 6 J (at -175\u00b0C).\n\nAverage = (Maximum + Minimum) / 2 = (124 + 6) / 2 = 65 J.\n\nFrom the graph, the temperature corresponding to an impact energy of 65 J is approximately -105\u00b0C. Therefore, the ductile-to-brittle transition temperature is closest to **-105\u00b0C**."
