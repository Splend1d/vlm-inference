    "description": "**Image 1 Description:**\n\nThe first image is a black-and-white illustration depicting Leonard Parkinson, identified as a Maroon resistance fighter from Jamaica around 1796. The figure is shown in motion, holding a musket with one hand and a knife or dagger in the other. He is dressed in loose-fitting clothing, including a sleeveless top and pants that appear to be tied at the knee. His posture suggests readiness for combat, and his expression conveys determination. The term \"Maroon\" historically refers to enslaved people who escaped and formed independent communities, often in remote areas.\n\n**Image 2 Description:**\n\nThe second image is a map showing the locations of major Cossack hosts within the former Russian Empire. The map includes numbered labels pointing to specific regions, each corresponding to a named Cossack host. These include the Don, Kuban, Terek, Astrakhan, Ural, Orenburg, Semirechensk, Siberian, Transbaikal, Amur, Ussuri, Irkutsk, and Yakutsk Cossacks. The Cossacks were semi-nomadic groups known for their military skills and often lived in borderlands or frontier regions of the Russian Empire, serving as a buffer against external threats.\n\n**Contextual Understanding:**\n\nWhen considering both images together, they depict societies that existed on the periphery of larger states. The Maroons in Jamaica were communities of escaped slaves who established themselves in remote areas, away from the control of colonial authorities. Similarly, the Cossacks in Russia were groups that lived in border regions, often functioning as autonomous military units that defended the edges of the Russian Empire. Both societies maintained a degree of independence while operating in areas that were considered the fringes of larger, more centralized powers.\n\nThus, the best context for understanding these images together is:\n\n**D. Societies existing on the periphery of large states.**"
