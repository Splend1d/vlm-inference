    "question": "The data in Table 8.2 are the result of a random survey of 39 national flags (with replacement between picks) from various countries. Let X = the number of colors on a national flag. <image 1> Construct a 95% confidence interval for the true mean number of colors on national flags. The 95% confidence interval is_____.",

    "description": "The image displays a frequency distribution table with two columns: \"X\" and \"Freq.\" \n\n- The column labeled \"X\" represents the number of colors on a national flag, with values ranging from 1 to 5.\n- The column labeled \"Freq.\" represents the frequency of each corresponding value of X.\n\nHere's the detailed breakdown:\n\n| X | Freq. |\n|---|-------|\n| 1 | 1     |\n| 2 | 7     |\n| 3 | 18    |\n| 4 | 7     |\n| 5 | 6     |\n\nThis table indicates that:\n- There is 1 flag with 1 color.\n- There are 7 flags with 2 colors.\n- There are 18 flags with 3 colors.\n- There are 7 flags with 4 colors.\n- There are 6 flags with 5 colors.\n\nThe total number of flags surveyed is the sum of all frequencies: \\(1 + 7 + 18 + 7 + 6 = 39\\). This matches the information provided in the question about the sample size being 39. \n\nTo construct a 95% confidence interval for the true mean number of colors on national flags, you would need to calculate the sample mean (\\(\\bar{x}\\)) and the standard deviation (s), then use these values along with the t-distribution for the confidence interval calculation. However, the specific calculations are not included in this description."
