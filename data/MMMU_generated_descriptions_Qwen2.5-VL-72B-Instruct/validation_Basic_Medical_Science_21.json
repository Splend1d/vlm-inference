    "question": "The thickened portion of the septum pellucidum represents <image 1> ",
    "options": "['The fornix', 'The septal nuclei', 'Both.', 'Neither.']",

    "description": "The image shows a coronal section of the brain, highlighting structures within the medial aspect of the cerebral hemispheres. The section appears to be stained, with varying shades indicating different tissue densities or types. In the center of the image, there is a prominent structure labeled by a yellow arrow. This structure is located near the midline and appears as a thickened band extending vertically. It is situated between two symmetrical, curved structures that resemble the fornix, which are visible on either side of the midline. The thickened band is part of the septum pellucidum, a thin membrane that separates the lateral ventricles in the brain. The septum pellucidum contains the septal nuclei, which are small clusters of neurons involved in various functions including memory and emotion. The fornix, while adjacent and related anatomically, is a distinct structure composed of white matter fibers connecting the hippocampus to other parts of the brain. \n\nBased on this description, the thickened portion of the septum pellucidum represents the septal nuclei. Therefore, the correct answer is B. The septal nuclei."
