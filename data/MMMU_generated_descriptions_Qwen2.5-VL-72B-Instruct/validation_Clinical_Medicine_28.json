    "question": "A 45-year-old woman has had a severe headache with nausea and vomiting for the past 2 days. On physical examination her blood pressure is 290/160 mm Hg. Laboratory studies show her serum creatinine is 3.7 mg/dL. The representative microscopic appearance of her kidneys is depicted here. Which of the following underlying diseases is she most likely to have? <image 1> ",
    "options": "['Hepatitis C', 'Breast carcinoma', 'Diabetes mellitus', 'Diffuse scleroderma']",
    "id": "validation_Clinical_Medicine_28",
    "description": "The image shows a histological section of kidney tissue stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). The most prominent feature in this image is a large, well-defined area of fibrosis forming a whorled or \"onion-skin\" pattern around what appears to be an arteriole or small artery. This pattern is characterized by concentric layers of fibrous tissue encircling the vessel, which is indicative of significant vascular damage. The surrounding tissue displays some degree of inflammation and fibrosis, with scattered inflammatory cells visible throughout the interstitium. There is no evidence of granulomas, necrosis, or other specific features associated with conditions like hepatitis C, breast carcinoma, or diabetes mellitus. The overall appearance is highly suggestive of a condition involving widespread vascular involvement and fibrosis.\n\nGiven the clinical presentation of hypertension, elevated serum creatinine, and the characteristic histological findings, the most likely underlying disease is diffuse scleroderma. Scleroderma is known to cause renal crisis, which can present with severe hypertension and acute kidney injury due to vasculopathy and fibrosis affecting the renal arteries and arterioles. The other options\u2014Hepatitis C, Breast carcinoma, and Diabetes mellitus\u2014do not typically present with the described histological changes or the combination of symptoms observed in this patient."
