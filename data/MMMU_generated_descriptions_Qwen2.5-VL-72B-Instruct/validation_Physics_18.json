    "description": "The image depicts an electrical circuit with four light bulbs labeled as #1, #2, #3, and #4. The circuit includes a power source represented by \u03b5 (an emf symbol). \n\n- **Bulb #1** is directly connected to the power source in series.\n- **Bulb #2** is connected in parallel with a combination of two other components: **bulb #3** and **bulb #4**, which are connected in series with each other.\n- There is a switch labeled \"S\" in the branch containing bulbs #3 and #4. When this switch is open, bulb #4 is not part of the active circuit, and only bulb #3 is connected in series with bulb #2.\n- When the switch \"S\" is closed, bulb #4 becomes part of the circuit, connecting in series with bulb #3, and both are in parallel with bulb #2.\n\nWhen the switch \"S\" is closed, bulb #4 illuminates. This action changes the overall resistance of the circuit involving bulbs #2, #3, and #4. Since all bulbs are identical, closing the switch will cause the current distribution to change. Specifically, the total resistance in the branch with bulbs #2, #3, and #4 decreases because the effective resistance of the series combination of bulbs #3 and #4 is less than the resistance of bulb #3 alone. As a result, more current flows through this branch, making bulb #2 brighter. Additionally, since the voltage across the parallel combination is shared between bulbs #3 and #4, both bulbs #3 and #4 will illuminate, but their individual brightness will be less than that of bulb #2 due to the division of current.\n\nTherefore, when the switch is closed and bulb #4 illuminates, **bulbs #2 and #3** also become brighter. \n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n**C. Bulbs #2 and #3 only**."
