    "description": "The image is a table detailing the activities required to build an experimental model of a smaller oven for high school and college kitchens. The table includes the following columns:\n\n- **Activity**: Lists the activities labeled A through G.\n- **Normal Time (weeks)**: Indicates the time it takes to complete each activity under normal conditions.\n- **Crash Time (weeks)**: Indicates the minimum time it takes to complete each activity when resources are maximized.\n- **Normal Cost ($)**: Indicates the cost associated with completing each activity under normal conditions.\n- **Crash Cost ($)**: Indicates the cost associated with completing each activity at its crash time.\n- **Immediate Predecessor(s)**: Indicates which activities must be completed before the current activity can begin.\n\nHere's the detailed information for each activity:\n\n- **Activity A**:\n  - Normal Time: 3 weeks\n  - Crash Time: 2 weeks\n  - Normal Cost: $1,000\n  - Crash Cost: $1,600\n  - Immediate Predecessor(s): None\n\n- **Activity B**:\n  - Normal Time: 2 weeks\n  - Crash Time: 1 week\n  - Normal Cost: $2,000\n  - Crash Cost: $2,700\n  - Immediate Predecessor(s): None\n\n- **Activity C**:\n  - Normal Time: 1 week\n  - Crash Time: 1 week\n  - Normal Cost: $300\n  - Crash Cost: $300\n  - Immediate Predecessor(s): None\n\n- **Activity D**:\n  - Normal Time: 7 weeks\n  - Crash Time: 3 weeks\n  - Normal Cost: $1,300\n  - Crash Cost: $1,600\n  - Immediate Predecessor(s): Activity A\n\n- **Activity E**:\n  - Normal Time: 6 weeks\n  - Crash Time: 3 weeks\n  - Normal Cost: $850\n  - Crash Cost: $1,000\n  - Immediate Predecessor(s): Activity B\n\n- **Activity F**:\n  - Normal Time: 2 weeks\n  - Crash Time: 1 week\n  - Normal Cost: $4,000\n  - Crash Cost: $5,000\n  - Immediate Predecessor(s): Activity C\n\n- **Activity G**:\n  - Normal Time: 4 weeks\n  - Crash Time: 2 weeks\n  - Normal Cost: $1,500\n  - Crash Cost: $2,000\n  - Immediate Predecessor(s): Activities D and E\n\nTo determine the project completion date, one would need to calculate the critical path using the normal times and then calculate the slack for each activity. The critical path is the sequence of activities that determines the minimum time required to complete the project. The slack for each activity is the amount of time by which the start of the activity can be delayed without delaying the project completion date. \n\nGiven the options provided, the correct slacks are: 0, 2, 11, 0, 2, 11, 0. This corresponds to option A."
