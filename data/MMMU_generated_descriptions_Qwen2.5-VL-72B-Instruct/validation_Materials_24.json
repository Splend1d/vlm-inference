    "description": "The image depicts a two-dimensional arrangement of four identical green circles, representing atoms or molecules in a crystal lattice. The circles are arranged in a square-like pattern, but they are touching each other at their edges, forming a close-packed structure. \n\nThere are two labeled distances between the centers of the circles:\n1. A horizontal distance between the centers of two adjacent circles along one row is labeled as \\(a\\sqrt{2}\\).\n2. A diagonal distance between the centers of two non-adjacent circles (forming a right triangle with the sides being the horizontal and vertical distances between the centers) is labeled as \\(a\\sqrt{3}\\).\n\nThe circles are arranged in two rows, with two circles in each row. The top row has two circles, and directly below it, there is another row of two circles. The circles in the bottom row are offset horizontally relative to those in the top row, creating a staggered arrangement. This specific arrangement and the given distances suggest a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure viewed from a particular direction.\n\nThe distances provided (\\(a\\sqrt{2}\\) and \\(a\\sqrt{3}\\)) are characteristic of an FCC lattice when viewed along the [110] direction. In this view, the distance between nearest neighbors along the [110] direction is \\(a\\sqrt{2}\\), and the distance along the body diagonal within the plane is \\(a\\sqrt{3}\\). Therefore, the unit cell plane depicted is consistent with an FCC {110} plane."
