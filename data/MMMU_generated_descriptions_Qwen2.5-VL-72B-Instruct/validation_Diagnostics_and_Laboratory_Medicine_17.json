    "description": "The image shows two side-by-side axial sections of the brain, likely from an MRI scan. The left section appears to show a relatively normal brain structure with visible sulci and gyri. The right section, however, exhibits significant atrophy, particularly in the midbrain region. There is a noticeable reduction in the size of the midbrain, which is a hallmark feature of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). The atrophy is more pronounced in the midline structures, including the area around the third ventricle. The overall appearance of the brain in the right section suggests a neurodegenerative process affecting the brainstem and basal ganglia regions. \n\nBased on these observations, the most likely diagnosis in this case is:\n\nB. Progressive supranuclear palsy"
