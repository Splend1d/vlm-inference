    "description": "The image depicts a schematic diagram of a precast concrete pile foundation. The diagram shows a single pile embedded in the ground with a cap at the top. The pile extends vertically downward into the soil, and its length is marked as 30 meters. At the bottom of the pile, there is a horizontal line indicating the soil pressure, labeled as 120 kPa. The notation \"p\u2080/kPa\" suggests this is the pressure distribution around the pile. \n\nThe image does not provide any specific information about the diameter (D) of the pile or the center distance between piles. However, it does illustrate a typical setup for a precast concrete pile foundation, which is relevant to understanding the context of the question regarding the minimum center distance between piles. \n\nTo answer the question, one would need to rely on general knowledge about precast concrete pile foundations rather than specific details from the image, as the image does not directly provide the required dimensions or distances."
