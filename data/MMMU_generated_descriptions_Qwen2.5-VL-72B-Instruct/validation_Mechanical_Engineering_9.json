    "description": "The image depicts a block diagram of a control system with the following components:\n\n- **Input Signal:** The input signal is denoted as \\( R(s) \\).\n- **Summing Junctions:** There are two summing junctions in the diagram. The first one combines the input \\( R(s) \\) with the feedback signal, while the second one combines the output of the gain \\( K_1 \\) with the output of the block \\( K_2 s \\).\n- **Gain Blocks:**\n  - \\( K_1 \\): This is a proportional gain block.\n  - \\( K_2 s \\): This is a derivative gain block, where \\( K_2 \\) is multiplied by \\( s \\), indicating a derivative action.\n- **Transfer Function Block:** The transfer function block is given by \\( \\frac{50}{s(s+1)} \\). This represents the plant or process being controlled.\n- **Output Signal:** The output signal is denoted as \\( C(s) \\).\n\nThe connections between these components are as follows:\n1. The input \\( R(s) \\) is fed into the first summing junction.\n2. The output of the first summing junction is multiplied by the gain \\( K_1 \\).\n3. The output of the \\( K_1 \\) block is then fed into the second summing junction.\n4. The output of the second summing junction is passed through the transfer function block \\( \\frac{50}{s(s+1)} \\).\n5. The output of the transfer function block is \\( C(s) \\), which is also fed back through the \\( K_2 s \\) block to the second summing junction.\n\nThe goal is to determine the values of \\( K_1 \\) and \\( K_2 \\) such that the closed-loop system has a peak time of 1 second and a settling time of 2 seconds for its step response. The options provided are:\nA. \\( K_2 = 0.6 \\), \\( K_1 = 0.277 \\)\nB. \\( K_2 = 0.06 \\), \\( K_1 = 0.377 \\)\nC. \\( K_2 = 0.06 \\), \\( K_1 = 0.277 \\)\nD. \\( K_2 = 0.01 \\), \\( K_1 = 0.177 \\)\n\nTo solve this problem, you would need to derive the closed-loop transfer function of the system, analyze its poles to determine the damping ratio and natural frequency, and then use the relationships between these parameters and the peak time and settling time to find the appropriate values of \\( K_1 \\) and \\( K_2 \\)."
