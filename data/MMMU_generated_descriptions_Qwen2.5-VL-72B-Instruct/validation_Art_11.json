    "description": "The image is a pointillist painting depicting a coastal scene. The technique used involves small, distinct dots of color applied in patterns to form an image. The scene features a sandy beach in the foreground with a few figures walking along it. To the right, there is a rocky cliff covered with greenery. In the background, the sea stretches out to the horizon under a partly cloudy sky. Several sailboats are visible on the water, adding to the serene maritime atmosphere. The use of pointillism, characterized by the meticulous application of tiny dots to create the overall picture, is a hallmark of this particular artistic style. \n\nGiven the description of the pointillist technique and the coastal subject matter, the artist who created this work is most likely **PAUL SIGNAC** (Option B). Paul Signac was a prominent French Neo-Impressionist painter known for his use of pointillism and his depictions of coastal scenes."
