    "description": "The image presents a table detailing various components contributing to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of China, with values expressed in billions. The table includes the following categories along with their respective amounts:\n\n- **Wages and Salaries:** 1000 billion\n- **Consumption:** 1700 billion\n- **Investment:** 700 billion\n- **Depreciation:** 50 billion\n- **Government Expenditure:** 100 billion\n- **Taxes:** 300 billion\n- **Exports:** 50 billion\n- **Imports:** 40 billion\n- **Income receipts from rest-of-the-world:** 10 billion\n- **Income payment to rest-of-the-world:** 50 billion\n\nTo calculate net exports, you subtract imports from exports. In this case, the value for exports is 50 billion, and the value for imports is 40 billion. Therefore, the net exports would be calculated as follows: \n\nNet Exports = Exports - Imports  \nNet Exports = 50 - 40  \nNet Exports = 10 billion  \n\nThus, the net exports for China are 10 billion."
