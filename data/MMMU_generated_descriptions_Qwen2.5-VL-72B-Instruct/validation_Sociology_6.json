    "description": "The image is an infographic titled \"FOLKWAYS.\" It explains that folkways are a category of norms roughly translated to 'social or cultural customs.' Folkways are one of four types of norms, with the others being laws, mores, and taboos. The infographic is divided into two main sections: \"DEFINITION\" and \"EXAMPLES.\"\n\nIn the \"DEFINITION\" section, it states that folkways are culturally-defined norms of etiquette that are not very serious if broken. They are mostly customary and polite. Folkways differ from other types of norms like taboos, mores, and laws because they tend to be less serious. They are not illegal (like laws) and often not even norms of morality (like mores).\n\nThe \"EXAMPLES\" section lists eight examples of folkways:\n1. Tucking in your Shirt\n2. Dressing Appropriately at Work\n3. Wearing a School Uniform\n4. Raising your Hand to Speak\n5. Only having Hard Drinks after 5 PM\n6. Not Spitting on the Sidewalk\n7. Working a 5 Day Week\n8. Saying Please and Thank You\n\nBased on this description, the correct answer to the question \"What is a <image 1>?\" is:\n\nB. Norms for routine or casual interaction. 'Everyday behaviors.' \n\nThis is because the definition and examples provided in the image describe folkways as everyday, customary, and polite behaviors that are not very serious if broken, fitting the description of norms for routine or casual interaction."
