    "question": "When an unsymmetrical alkene such as propene is treated with N-bromosuccinimide in aqueous dimethyl sulfoxide, the major product has the bromine atom bonded to the less highly substituted carbon atom. Is the following one Markovnikov or non-Markovnikov orientation? <image 1>",

    "description": "The image depicts a chemical reaction involving propene (CH\u2083CH=CH\u2082) reacting with bromine (Br\u2082) in the presence of water (H\u2082O). The reactant, propene, is an unsymmetrical alkene with a double bond between the second and third carbon atoms. The product formed is CH\u2083CH(OH)CH\u2082Br, which shows that bromine (Br) has added to the less substituted carbon (the terminal carbon), while the hydroxyl group (OH) has added to the more substituted carbon (the secondary carbon).\n\nThis reaction follows the Markovnikov rule, where the electrophile (bromine) adds to the carbon with fewer hydrogen atoms, and the nucleophile (hydroxyl from water) adds to the carbon with more hydrogen atoms. Therefore, the orientation shown in the image is a **Markovnikov orientation**. \n\nThe question asks whether this is a Markovnikov or non-Markovnikov orientation. Based on the described reaction, it is clear that the correct answer is:\n\nA. Markovnikov orientation."
