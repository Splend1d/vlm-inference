    "question": "The market for pizza has the following demand and supply schedules:<image 1> If the actual price in this market were above the equilibrium price, what would drive the market toward the equilibrium?",
    "options": "['excess supply', 'excess demand', 'both', 'neither']",
    "id": "validation_Economics_10",
    "description": "The image presents a table with three columns: Price, Quantity Demanded, and Quantity Supplied. The data within these columns are as follows:\n\n- At a price of $4, the quantity demanded is 135 pizzas, and the quantity supplied is 26 pizzas.\n- At a price of $5, the quantity demanded is 104 pizzas, and the quantity supplied is 53 pizzas.\n- At a price of $6, the quantity demanded is 81 pizzas, and the quantity supplied is 81 pizzas.\n- At a price of $7, the quantity demanded is 68 pizzas, and the quantity supplied is 98 pizzas.\n- At a price of $8, the quantity demanded is 53 pizzas, and the quantity supplied is 110 pizzas.\n- At a price of $9, the quantity demanded is 39 pizzas, and the quantity supplied is 121 pizzas.\n\nThe equilibrium price is where the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied. In this case, it occurs at a price of $6, where both the quantity demanded and supplied are 81 pizzas. \n\nIf the actual price in the market were above the equilibrium price (for example, $7, $8, or $9), there would be an excess supply because the quantity supplied would exceed the quantity demanded. This excess supply would put downward pressure on the price, driving the market back toward the equilibrium price of $6. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is A. excess supply."
