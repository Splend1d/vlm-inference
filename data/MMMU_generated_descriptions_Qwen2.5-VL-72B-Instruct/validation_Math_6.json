    "description": "The image shows a geometric diagram involving a circle with center \\( O \\). The circle has a tangent line \\( \\overline{PS} \\) touching the circle at point \\( S \\). Additionally, there is a secant line \\( \\overline{PQR} \\) that intersects the circle at points \\( Q \\) and \\( R \\).\n\nKey details from the diagram:\n- Point \\( P \\) is outside the circle.\n- \\( \\overline{PS} \\) is a tangent to the circle at point \\( S \\).\n- \\( \\overline{PQR} \\) is a secant line intersecting the circle at points \\( Q \\) and \\( R \\).\n- The lengths provided in the problem are: \\( PS = x \\), \\( PQ = 3 \\), and \\( PR = x + 18 \\).\n\nThe relationship between the tangent and the secant segments can be described by the Power of a Point theorem, which states:\n\\[ PS^2 = PQ \\cdot PR \\]\n\nSubstituting the given values into the equation:\n\\[ x^2 = 3 \\cdot (x + 18) \\]\n\nThis equation can be solved to find the value of \\( x \\):\n\\[ x^2 = 3(x + 18) \\]\n\\[ x^2 = 3x + 54 \\]\n\\[ x^2 - 3x - 54 = 0 \\]\n\nFactoring the quadratic equation:\n\\[ (x - 9)(x + 6) = 0 \\]\n\nThus, the solutions are:\n\\[ x = 9 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x = -6 \\]\n\nSince \\( x \\) represents a length, it must be positive:\n\\[ x = 9 \\]\n\nTherefore, the length of \\( \\overline{PS} \\) is \\( 9 \\)."
