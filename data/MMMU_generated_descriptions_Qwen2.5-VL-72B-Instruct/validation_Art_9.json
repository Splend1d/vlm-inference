    "question": "Many of Frederic Leighton's early paintings took their inspiration from the Renaissance art historian Giorgio Vasari's text The Lives of the Artists. It includes <image 1> that shows the death of which famous figure?",
    "options": "['Cimabue', 'Donatello', 'Giotto', 'Brunelleschi']",
    "id": "validation_Art_9",
    "description": "The image depicts a scene set in what appears to be a Renaissance-era cityscape with classical architecture, including domed buildings and arches. In the foreground, there is a group of people gathered around a central figure who is lying down, seemingly lifeless, draped in white cloth. This central figure is being mourned by several individuals. \n\nOne man, dressed in a pinkish robe over a dark garment, stands prominently beside the deceased, holding a book or scroll, suggesting he might be a scholar or a person of importance. Another figure, possibly a woman, is seated near the deceased, wearing a red garment, and appears to be in distress. A young child is also present, looking up at the scene with a small dog nearby. \n\nIn the background, there are other figures observing the scene, and the setting is adorned with floral decorations, indicating a significant event. The overall composition and the presence of the mourning figures suggest that this is a depiction of the death of a notable individual. Given the historical context and the artistic style, the scene likely represents the death of a famous figure from the Renaissance period. \n\nBased on the description, the image most closely aligns with the death of Giotto, as it matches the narrative and visual elements described in Giorgio Vasari's \"The Lives of the Artists.\" Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Giotto"
