    "description": "The image depicts a four-stage RC ladder network circuit labeled as Fig. 1. The circuit consists of alternating resistors (R) and capacitors (C) connected in series between an input voltage \\( V_{in} \\) and an output voltage \\( V_{out} \\). \n\nEach stage of the ladder network has the following components:\n- A resistor with a resistance of 10 k\u03a9.\n- A capacitor with a capacitance of 0.5 \u00b5F.\n\nThe input voltage \\( V_{in} \\) is applied at the left end of the circuit, and the output voltage \\( V_{out} \\) is taken from the right end of the circuit. The frequency of the signal is given as \\( \\omega = 100 \\text{ rad/s} \\).\n\nThe circuit configuration is as follows:\n1. \\( V_{in} \\) is connected to the first resistor (10 k\u03a9).\n2. The first resistor is connected in series with the first capacitor (0.5 \u00b5F).\n3. This pattern continues for three more stages: each stage consists of a 10 k\u03a9 resistor followed by a 0.5 \u00b5F capacitor.\n4. The final capacitor is connected to \\( V_{out} \\).\n\nThe goal is to determine the phase of \\( V_{out} \\) when \\( V_{in} = 100 \\angle 0^\\circ \\) mV. The phase shift introduced by each RC stage can be calculated using the formula for the phase shift of an RC circuit at a given frequency. Since there are four stages, the total phase shift will be the sum of the phase shifts from each individual stage."
