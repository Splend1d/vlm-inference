    "description": "The image shows a histological section stained with cresyl violet, which highlights the cytoarchitecture of the brainstem. The section appears to be at the level of the medulla oblongata, specifically focusing on the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve (DMNV). This nucleus is located in the medulla and is part of the parasympathetic nervous system. \n\nIn the image, there is a prominent structure labeled by an arrow, which corresponds to the DMNV. The DMNV is a columnar group of neurons situated near the midline, just ventral to the fourth ventricle. These neurons give rise to preganglionic parasympathetic fibers that travel through the vagus nerve (cranial nerve X) to innervate various organs in the thoracic and abdominal cavities.\n\nGiven the location and function of the DMNV, the axons originating from this nucleus terminate in postganglionic parasympathetic cell bodies located in ganglia associated with the organs they innervate. These postganglionic neurons then project to their respective target tissues, including smooth muscles of the viscera, cardiac muscle, and glands.\n\nTherefore, based on the description of the image and the function of the DMNV, the correct answer to the question \"Where do the axons of this nucleus terminate?\" is:\n\nB. Postganglionic parasympathetic cell bodies."
