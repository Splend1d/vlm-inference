    "description": "The image is a historical map titled \"Migrations + Expulsions of Jews,\" depicting the movement of Jewish populations across Europe and parts of Asia and Africa from approximately the 7th century to the 17th century. The map uses two types of arrows: dashed lines for migrations and solid lines for expulsions. \n\nKey details include:\n\n- **Spain (1492)**: A significant expulsion of Jews occurred in Spain in 1492, marked by a solid arrow pointing outward. This event is one of the largest and most prominent on the map.\n- **Portugal (1497)**: Another major expulsion took place in Portugal in 1497, also indicated by a solid arrow.\n- **France (1182)**: An expulsion is noted in France in 1182.\n- **England (1290)**: An expulsion is recorded in England in 1290.\n- **Germany**: Multiple expulsions are shown throughout Germany between 1150 and 1350.\n- **Poland**: Migrations into Poland are depicted between 1250 and 1400, primarily from Germany.\n- **Ottoman Empire**: The map shows several migrations into the Ottoman Empire, particularly after the expulsions from Spain and Portugal.\n- **Italy**: There are some expulsions and migrations within Italy, but they are less pronounced compared to other regions.\n- **Russia**: Limited information is provided about Russia, with a migration noted between 700 and 900.\n- **Africa**: No significant expulsions or migrations are depicted in Africa.\n\nThe map highlights that many expulsions occurred in Western European countries, particularly those historically associated with Catholicism, such as Spain, Portugal, France, and England. In contrast, the Ottoman Empire appears to have been a destination for Jewish migrants rather than a source of expulsions. The map does not provide specific information about Protestant regions or economic conditions influencing voluntary migrations."
