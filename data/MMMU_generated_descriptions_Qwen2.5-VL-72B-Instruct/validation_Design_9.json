    "description": "The image depicts an intricately detailed triptych, which is a three-paneled artwork. The central panel features a prominent figure seated on a throne, flanked by two standing figures, all adorned with halos, suggesting their religious significance. Surrounding them are various other figures, also haloed, arranged in a hierarchical manner. The left and right panels each contain two rows of figures; the top row has two soldiers holding spears, while the bottom row consists of smaller circular portraits of individuals. Below these portraits, there are additional standing figures, each holding objects like books or staffs. The entire piece is crafted from a smooth, off-white material with fine detailing and decorative borders, characteristic of carved ivory. The craftsmanship includes delicate lines and textures, indicating a high level of skill in carving. The overall appearance and texture suggest that the medium used for this triptych is carved ivory."
