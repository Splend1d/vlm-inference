    "description": "The image depicts an illustration of a fox with a long, coiled tail. The fox appears to be made out of a textured material resembling knitted or crocheted fabric, primarily in yellow with black outlines. The fox has a pink nose and inner ears, and its eyes are closed, giving it a somewhat serene expression. The tail is particularly notable for being very long and winding, almost like a snake, and it is also made from the same yellow, textured material. The background is plain white, which makes the fox stand out prominently.\n\nThe image does not contain any text within it. However, the question references \"Rosie's Walk,\" a children's book where the text describes Rosie the hen walking around her farm while a fox follows her, unaware that he is walking into various traps. The illustrations show the fox encountering these traps, but the text does not mention them, creating a humorous contrast between what the reader sees and what the text describes.\n\nGiven this context, the term that refers to when text and illustration tell different stories, as seen in \"Rosie's Walk,\" is:\n\nC. Counterpoint"
