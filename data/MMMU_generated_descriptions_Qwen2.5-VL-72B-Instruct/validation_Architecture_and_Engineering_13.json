    "description": "The image depicts a pin-connected truss structure labeled as \"P9.31.\" The structure consists of four nodes: A, B, C, and D. Node A is located at the bottom center of the structure and is subjected to a downward force of 200 kN. Nodes B, C, and D are positioned horizontally at the top of the structure, with each node connected to node A by inclined members.\n\n### Dimensions:\n- The horizontal distance between nodes B and C is 4 meters.\n- The horizontal distance between nodes C and D is also 4 meters.\n- The vertical distance from node A to the line connecting nodes B, C, and D is 4 meters.\n\n### Members:\n- Member AB connects node A to node B.\n- Member AC connects node A to node C.\n- Member AD connects node A to node D.\n- Member BC connects node B to node C.\n- Member CD connects node C to node D.\n\n### Cross-sectional Areas:\n- The cross-sectional area of member AB (AAB) is 1000 mm\u00b2.\n- The cross-sectional areas of members AC and AD (AAC and AAD) are both 500 mm\u00b2.\n\n### Material Properties:\n- The modulus of elasticity (E) for all members is given as 200 GPa.\n\n### Supports:\n- Nodes B, C, and D are supported by rollers, allowing them to move horizontally but not vertically.\n\n### Objective:\nThe task is to determine the vertical displacement at node A due to the applied load of 200 kN. The options provided for the vertical displacement at A are:\n- A. 4.32 mm\n- B. 4.12 mm\n- C. 4.22 mm\n\nThis description provides all necessary details about the geometry, material properties, loading conditions, and support conditions of the structure, enabling the calculation of the vertical displacement at node A."
