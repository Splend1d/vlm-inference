    "question": "Which of the following graphs best displays the relationship between a person's level of arousal and his or her performance on a challenging task?",
    "options": "['<image 1>', '<image 2>', '<image 3>', '<image 4>', '<image 5>']",
    "id": "validation_Psychology_30",
    "description": "The provided images depict various relationships between \"Performance\" (on the vertical axis) and \"Arousal\" (on the horizontal axis).\n\n- **Image A** shows a U-shaped curve where performance decreases with increasing arousal up to a point, then increases again as arousal continues to rise.\n  \n- **Image B** illustrates a straight line sloping downward from left to right, indicating that performance decreases consistently as arousal increases.\n  \n- **Image C** presents a V-shaped curve where performance decreases sharply with increasing arousal until it reaches a minimum point, after which it increases sharply as arousal rises further.\n  \n- **Image D** depicts a straight line sloping upward from left to right, suggesting that performance increases steadily as arousal increases.\n  \n- **Image E** shows an inverted U-shaped curve where performance increases with arousal up to a peak, after which it starts to decrease as arousal continues to rise.\n\n\nThe question asks for the graph that best represents the relationship between a person's level of arousal and their performance on a challenging task. Based on the descriptions:\n\n- Image A suggests a complex relationship where performance dips and then rises again.\n- Image B indicates a negative correlation between arousal and performance.\n- Image C shows a sharp decline followed by a sharp increase in performance.\n- Image D implies a positive linear relationship between arousal and performance.\n- Image E reflects an optimal level of arousal at which performance peaks before declining, which aligns with the well-known Yerkes-Dodson Law describing the relationship between arousal and performance on tasks. \n\nTherefore, **Image E** is the most appropriate choice."
