    "description": "The image shows two containers labeled \"Solution A\" and \"Solution B,\" each containing a solution of calcium hydroxide in water. \n\n- **Solution A**:\n  - Volume: 500. mL\n  - Concentration: 0.350 M (molarity)\n  - The container is filled with a gray-colored liquid representing the solution.\n  \n- **Solution B**:\n  - Volume: 300. mL\n  - Concentration: Unknown (represented by \"??? M\")\n  - The container is also filled with a gray-colored liquid representing the solution.\n\nThe question focuses on Solution A, which has a known concentration and volume. The task is to determine the mass of calcium hydroxide dissolved in Solution A, given its molarity and volume. The molar mass of calcium hydroxide is provided as 74.093 g/mol."
