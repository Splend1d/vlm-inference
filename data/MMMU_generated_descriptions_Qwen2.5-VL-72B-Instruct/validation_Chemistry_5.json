    "description": "The image depicts a Newman projection of a molecule viewed along the C-2 to C-3 bond. The carbon atoms (C-2 and C-3) are represented by the intersection point of the lines in the projection. \n\nAt C-2:\n- The front carbon (C-2) has three substituents: \n  - A methyl group (CH\u2083) pointing upwards.\n  - A hydrogen atom (H) pointing to the left.\n  - A chlorine atom (Cl) pointing downwards.\n\nAt C-3:\n- The back carbon (C-3) has three substituents:\n  - An ethyl group (C\u2082H\u2085) pointing downwards.\n  - A hydrogen atom (H) pointing to the right.\n  - A chlorine atom (Cl) pointing upwards.\n\nThe relative positions of these substituents around the C-2 and C-3 carbons are crucial for determining their stereochemical configurations (R or S)."
