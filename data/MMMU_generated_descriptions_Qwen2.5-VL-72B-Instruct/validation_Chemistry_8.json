    "options": "[\"It's an aldotetrose.\", \"It's an aldopentose.\", \"It's a ketopentose.\", \"It's a ketohexose.\"]",

    "description": "The image shows the structural formula of a monosaccharide labeled \"Threose.\" The molecule consists of four carbon atoms arranged in a straight chain. The first carbon atom (from the top) has a double bond with an oxygen atom, indicating it is a carbonyl group (-C=O). This makes it an aldose. The second, third, and fourth carbon atoms each have a hydroxyl group (-OH) attached to them. Additionally, the fourth carbon atom also has a CH2OH group attached. The molecule does not contain any ketone groups (a carbon double-bonded to oxygen within the chain).\n\nThe label \"Threose\" confirms this is a specific type of four-carbon sugar. Based on the structure and the label, Threose is classified as an aldose with four carbon atoms."
