    "description": "The image is a macroeconomic graph illustrating the interaction between aggregate demand (AD), short-run aggregate supply (SRAS), and long-run aggregate supply (LRAS). The vertical axis represents the price level, while the horizontal axis represents real output or income (rY).\n\n- **LRAS**: This line is vertical, indicating that in the long run, the economy's potential output is fixed and does not change with price levels. It represents the full employment level of output where all resources are fully utilized.\n  \n- **SRAS**: This line slopes upward, showing that in the short run, firms are willing to supply more goods and services at higher price levels. The SRAS curve intersects the LRAS curve at point A, which is the long-run equilibrium where the economy is operating at its potential output.\n\n- **AD**: This line slopes downward, reflecting the inverse relationship between the price level and the quantity of goods and services demanded. It intersects both the SRAS and LRAS curves at point A, confirming this point as the long-run equilibrium.\n\nPoint A, where AD, SRAS, and LRAS intersect, represents the economy's long-run equilibrium. At this point, the economy is producing at its potential output, and there is no pressure for prices to change.\n\nIf the economy experiences a boom, it means that the AD curve shifts to the right, leading to a new short-run equilibrium where the price level is higher, and output exceeds the potential output (LRAS). Given that wages are flexible, the higher price level and increased demand for labor will cause wages to rise. As wages rise, the cost of production increases, shifting the SRAS curve to the left. This process continues until the economy returns to the long-run equilibrium at point A, where the SRAS curve intersects the LRAS and AD curves again.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to the question is:\n\n**B. Wages will rise.**"
