    "description": "The image displays a table with two columns: \"Category\" and \"Amount (in billions of domestic currency).\" The categories listed under \"Category\" are:\n\n1. Coins and Currency in Circulation\n2. Checkable Deposits\n3. Traveler's Checks\n4. Savings Accounts\n5. Money Market Mutual Funds\n6. Time Deposits\n\nThe corresponding amounts in billions of domestic currency for each category are:\n\n1. Coins and Currency in Circulation: 1100\n2. Checkable Deposits: 1\n3. Traveler's Checks: 1500\n4. Savings Accounts: 8200\n5. Money Market Mutual Funds: 1\n6. Time Deposits: 800\n\nM1 is typically calculated by summing up the values of Coins and Currency in Circulation, Checkable Deposits, and Traveler's Checks. Therefore, to find M1 for Canada using this data:\n\nM1 = Coins and Currency in Circulation + Checkable Deposits + Traveler's Checks  \nM1 = 1100 + 1 + 1500  \nM1 = 2601  \n\nThus, the correct answer is A. 2601."
