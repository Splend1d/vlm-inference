    "description": "The image shows an electrocardiogram (ECG) tracing. The ECG displays a regular rhythm with P waves preceding each QRS complex, indicating atrial depolarization followed by ventricular depolarization. The P waves appear normal in morphology and are upright in lead II, which is consistent with sinus node activity. The PR interval appears to be prolonged, suggesting a delay in conduction between the atria and the ventricles. The QRS complexes are narrow and regular, indicating normal ventricular depolarization. There are no premature atrial contractions (PACs) or premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) visible in the tracing. The heart rate appears to be within the normal range for sinus rhythm.\n\nBased on this description, the rhythm can be identified as:\n\nD. NSR with 1st Degree AV Block"
