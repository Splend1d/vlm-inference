    "description": "The image presents a 2x2 contingency table summarizing data from a case-control study. The table compares two groups: the \"Case group\" and the \"Control group,\" each with a total of 500 individuals. The exposure status is categorized into two levels: \"A history of exposure\" and \"No history of exposure.\"\n\nHere's the breakdown of the table:\n\n- **Case group**:\n  - A history of exposure: 400 individuals.\n  - No history of exposure: 100 individuals.\n  - Total: 500 individuals.\n\n- **Control group**:\n  - A history of exposure: 100 individuals.\n  - No history of exposure: 400 individuals.\n  - Total: 500 individuals.\n\nTo calculate the odds ratio (OR), you would use the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{OR} = \\frac{(a \\times d)}{(b \\times c)} \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( a \\) = 400 (Case group with a history of exposure)\n- \\( b \\) = 100 (Case group with no history of exposure)\n- \\( c \\) = 100 (Control group with a history of exposure)\n- \\( d \\) = 400 (Control group with no history of exposure)\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{OR} = \\frac{(400 \\times 400)}{(100 \\times 100)} = \\frac{160000}{10000} = 16 \\]\n\nTherefore, the odds ratio (OR) is 16."
