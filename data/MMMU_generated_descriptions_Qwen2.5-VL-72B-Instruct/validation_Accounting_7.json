    "question": "You are a consultant to a large manufacturing orporation that is considering a project with thefollowing net after-tax cash flows (in millions of dollars ): <image 1> The project's beta is 1.8. Assuming that rf = 8% and E(rM) = 16%, what is the highest possible beta estimate for the project before its NPV becomes negative?",

    "description": "The image presents a table detailing the after-tax cash flows for a project over a specified period. The table has two columns: \"Years from Now\" and \"After-Tax Cash Flow.\"\n\n- In the first row, under \"Years from Now,\" it shows \"0,\" indicating the present year. Correspondingly, in the \"After-Tax Cash Flow\" column, there is a value of \"-40,\" representing an initial outlay or investment of 40 million dollars.\n  \n- The second row covers the years \"1\u201310.\" Under \"After-Tax Cash Flow,\" it lists \"15,\" which means the project generates a consistent after-tax cash flow of 15 million dollars each year from year 1 through year 10.\n\nThis information is crucial for calculating the Net Present Value (NPV) of the project using the provided financial data and assumptions about the risk-free rate (rf), market return (E(rM)), and the project's beta."
