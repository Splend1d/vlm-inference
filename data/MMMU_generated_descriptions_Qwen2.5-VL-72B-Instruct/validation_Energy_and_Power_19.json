    "question": "The jet engine in Fig. P3.50 admits air at 20\u00b0C and 1 atm at (1), where A_1 = 0.5 m^2 and V_1 = 250 m/s. The fuel-air ratio is 1:30. The air leaves section (2) at 1 atm, V_2 = 900 m/s, and A_2 = 0.4 m^2. Compute the test stand support reaction R_x needed. <image 1>",

    "description": "The image depicts a schematic diagram of a jet engine combustion chamber. The diagram includes the following key components and labels:\n\n- **Combustion Chamber**: This is the central part of the diagram, indicating where the combustion process occurs.\n- **Inlet (1)**: Located on the left side of the combustion chamber, this is where air enters the system. The inlet area \\(A_1\\) is given as 0.5 m\u00b2, and the velocity \\(V_1\\) of the incoming air is 250 m/s. The temperature and pressure of the air entering at point (1) are specified as 20\u00b0C and 1 atm, respectively.\n- **Fuel Input (\\(m_{\\text{fuel}}\\))**: Above the combustion chamber, there is an arrow pointing downward labeled \\(m_{\\text{fuel}}\\), representing the mass flow rate of fuel being injected into the combustion chamber. The fuel-air ratio is provided as 1:30, meaning for every unit mass of fuel, there are 30 units of air.\n- **Outlet (2)**: Positioned on the right side of the combustion chamber, this is where the exhaust gases exit the system. The outlet area \\(A_2\\) is given as 0.4 m\u00b2, and the velocity \\(V_2\\) of the exiting gases is 900 m/s. The pressure at the outlet is stated to be 1 atm.\n- **Test Stand Support Reaction (\\(R_x\\))**: Below the combustion chamber, there is an arrow labeled \\(R_x\\) pointing to the right, representing the horizontal force exerted by the test stand to support the engine. This force is what needs to be calculated.\n\nThe question asks for the computation of the test stand support reaction \\(R_x\\) using the given parameters and options provided. The values for areas, velocities, pressures, temperatures, and the fuel-air ratio are all clearly indicated in the diagram and accompanying text."
