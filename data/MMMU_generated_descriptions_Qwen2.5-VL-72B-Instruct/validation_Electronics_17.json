    "description": "The image contains three electrical circuit diagrams labeled as Fig. 1(a), Fig. 1(b), and Fig. 1(c). The focus here is on Fig. 1(b).\n\n### Fig. 1(b):\n- **Components:**\n  - A voltage source of 100V.\n  - A switch that opens at \\( t = 0 \\).\n  - A resistor of 30\u03a9 connected directly to the voltage source.\n  - Another resistor of 20\u03a9 in series with an inductor of 5H.\n  - A third resistor of 4\u03a9 connected in parallel with the inductor.\n  \n- **Connections:**\n  - The 30\u03a9 resistor is connected between the positive terminal of the 100V source and the junction where the other components meet.\n  - The 20\u03a9 resistor and the 5H inductor are in series, forming one branch from this junction.\n  - The 4\u03a9 resistor is in parallel with the inductor, forming another branch from the same junction.\n  - The negative terminal of the 100V source connects back to complete the circuit.\n\n- **Voltage across the inductor:**\n  - The voltage \\( v \\) is marked across the inductor, with the positive polarity indicated on the side closer to the 20\u03a9 resistor.\n\n### Context:\n- The question specifies that after \\( t = 0 \\), the circuit becomes source-free. This implies that the switch opens at \\( t = 0 \\), disconnecting the 100V source, leaving only the inductor and resistors in the circuit.\n- The task is to find the expression for the voltage \\( v \\) across the inductor for \\( t > 0 \\).\n\n### Possible Answer:\nGiven the options provided:\nA. \\( 10e^{-0.8t} \\) V\nB. \\( -5e^{-0.8t} \\) V\nC. \\( -2e^{-1t} \\) V\nD. \\( -6e^{-2t} \\) V\n\nThe correct expression for \\( v \\) will depend on the time constant (\\( \\tau \\)) of the circuit and the initial conditions. The time constant \\( \\tau \\) for an RL circuit is given by \\( \\tau = \\frac{L}{R_{eq}} \\), where \\( R_{eq} \\) is the equivalent resistance seen by the inductor when the source is removed. \n\nFor this specific circuit, the equivalent resistance \\( R_{eq} \\) is the parallel combination of 20\u03a9 and 4\u03a9, which is approximately 3.33\u03a9. Thus, \\( \\tau = \\frac{5H}{3.33\\Omega} \\approx 1.5s \\). However, none of the options match this exact value, suggesting a need to re-evaluate or consider the closest matching option based on the given choices."
