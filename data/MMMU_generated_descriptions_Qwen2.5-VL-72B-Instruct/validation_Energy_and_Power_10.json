    "question": "<image 1>The accompanying sketch shows the schematic arrangement for measuring the thermal conductivity by the guarded hot plate method. Two similar 1 cm thick specimens receive heat from a 6.5 cm by 6.5 cm guard heater. When the power dissipation by the wattmeter was 15 W, the thermocouples inserted at the hot and cold surfaces indicated temperatures as 325 K and 300 K. What is the thermal conductivity of the test specimen material?",

    "description": "The image depicts a schematic diagram of an experimental setup used to measure thermal conductivity using the guarded hot plate method. The setup includes the following components:\n\n1. **Current Source**: A current source is shown at the top of the diagram, indicating that it supplies electrical energy to the system.\n   \n2. **Guard Ring**: A rectangular area labeled \"Guard Ring\" surrounds the central heating element. This guard ring is designed to minimize heat loss from the edges of the central heater, ensuring that heat flows primarily through the test specimens in a one-dimensional manner.\n\n3. **Heater**: Within the guard ring, there is a zigzag line labeled \"Heater.\" This represents the heating element that generates heat. The heater is placed between two identical test specimens.\n\n4. **Test Specimens**: Two rectangular blocks represent the test specimens. These specimens are positioned on either side of the heater, with their thickness specified as 1 cm each. The heater is sandwiched between these two specimens.\n\n5. **Wattmeter (W)**: A device labeled \"W\" is connected in the circuit, which measures the power dissipated by the heater. In this case, the wattmeter indicates a power dissipation of 15 W.\n\n6. **Dimensions of the Guard Heater**: The dimensions of the guard heater are given as 6.5 cm by 6.5 cm.\n\n7. **Temperature Measurements**: Thermocouples are used to measure the temperatures at the hot and cold surfaces of the test specimens. The temperature at the hot surface is 325 K, and the temperature at the cold surface is 300 K.\n\nThis setup allows for the calculation of thermal conductivity using the formula:\n\\[ k = \\frac{Q \\cdot L}{A \\cdot \\Delta T} \\]\nwhere \\( k \\) is the thermal conductivity, \\( Q \\) is the power dissipated (15 W), \\( L \\) is the thickness of the specimen (0.01 m), \\( A \\) is the area of the heater (0.065 m \u00d7 0.065 m), and \\( \\Delta T \\) is the temperature difference (325 K - 300 K).\n\nBy substituting the values into the formula, the thermal conductivity \\( k \\) can be calculated."
