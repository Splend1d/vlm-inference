    "question": "In the Base of Skull, identify the 204 structure. <image 1>",
    "options": "['Lateral pterygoid plate', 'Articular fossa', 'Carotid canal', 'Foramen lacerum']",
    "id": "validation_Biology_17",
    "description": "The image is a labeled diagram of the lateral view of the base of the skull. The diagram includes various anatomical structures with numbered labels pointing to specific parts. \n\n- Label **204** points to a large, roughly oval-shaped depression located near the top of the diagram. This depression is situated posteriorly and superiorly in relation to other structures.\n  \n- Label **205** indicates a smaller, more circular opening located inferior and slightly anterior to label 204.\n  \n- Label **206** points to another opening further down, which appears to be a canal or foramen.\n  \n- Label **207** marks a broad area at the bottom of the diagram, likely representing the body of the mandible.\n  \n- Labels **208**, **209**, and **210** point to structures closer to the center of the diagram, including what appears to be a joint-like structure (possibly the temporomandibular joint) and associated features.\n\nGiven these observations, label **204** corresponds to the **Articular fossa**, which is the large depression where the head of the mandible articulates. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Articular fossa"
