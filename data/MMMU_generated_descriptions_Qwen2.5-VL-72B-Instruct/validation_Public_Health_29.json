    "question": "A case-control study of the association between drinking surface water and rectal cancer was conducted by a person who, considering that place of residence may be a potential confounding factor when analysing the association between drinking different types of water and rectal cancer, further divided the place of residence into rural and urban areas, and obtained the data in the table below.<image 1> The adjusted OR was",

    "description": "The provided table presents data from a case-control study examining the relationship between drinking water type (surface water vs. deep water) and rectal cancer cases, while also considering the place of residence (rural vs. urban) as a potential confounding factor. The table is organized into four main columns: \"Rural\" and \"Urban,\" each further divided into \"Cases (%)\" and \"Control (%).\" There are two rows under \"Drinking water\": \"Drinking surface water\" and \"Drinking deep water.\"\n\n### Rural Area Data:\n- **Drinking Surface Water**:\n  - Cases: 20 (40.0%)\n  - Controls: 50 (25.0%)\n  \n- **Drinking Deep Water**:\n  - Cases: 30 (60.0%)\n  - Controls: 150 (75.0%)\n\n### Urban Area Data:\n- **Drinking Surface Water**:\n  - Cases: 150 (75.0%)\n  - Controls: 30 (60.0%)\n  \n- **Drinking Deep Water**:\n  - Cases: 50 (25.0%)\n  - Controls: 20 (40.0%)\n\n### Totals:\n- Rural:\n  - Total Cases: 50\n  - Total Controls: 200\n  \n- Urban:\n  - Total Cases: 200\n  - Total Controls: 50\n\nThis table allows for calculating the odds ratios (ORs) for both rural and urban areas separately to adjust for the potential confounding effect of place of residence. The adjusted OR can then be determined using these separate calculations."
