    "question": "The patient shown below has had abdominal pain for a week. What is the most likely diagnosis? <image 1> ",

    "description": "This image is an abdominal X-ray (KUB view) showing the bony structures of the spine and pelvis along with the gas patterns in the gastrointestinal tract. The vertebral column is visible in the center, extending from the thoracic to the lumbar region. The pelvic bones are seen at the bottom of the image, framing the lower abdomen.\n\nIn the gastrointestinal tract, there are multiple dilated loops of bowel, which appear to be filled with gas. These dilated loops are more prominent in the central and upper portions of the abdomen, suggesting a blockage higher up in the gastrointestinal tract. There is also a significant amount of gas present in the colon, but it does not appear as distended as the small bowel loops.\n\nThere are no visible signs of free air under the diaphragm, which would suggest a perforation. The overall appearance of the bowel gas pattern is consistent with a mechanical obstruction rather than a paralytic ileus, as the dilation is localized and not generalized throughout the entire bowel.\n\nBased on these observations, the most likely diagnosis is **B. Small bowel obstruction**. The presence of multiple dilated loops of small bowel suggests a blockage within the small intestine, leading to the accumulation of gas and fluid proximal to the obstruction. This is a common presentation of small bowel obstruction on an abdominal X-ray."
