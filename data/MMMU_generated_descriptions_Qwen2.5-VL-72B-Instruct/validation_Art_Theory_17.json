    "description": "The image depicts a modernist building characterized by its stark simplicity and functional design. The structure features a flat roof, a rectangular form, and an extensive use of glass windows arranged in a horizontal band across the second floor. The building is elevated on slender, cylindrical columns, creating a sense of lightness and openness beneath it. The facade is predominantly white, with minimal ornamentation, emphasizing clean lines and geometric forms. The entrance area is sheltered under the overhanging upper floor, and there are no visible decorative elements, reinforcing the building's focus on functionality and efficiency. The surrounding environment includes a grassy lawn and some trees, but the architecture itself stands out as the central element, showcasing a design philosophy that prioritizes practicality and simplicity. \n\nBased on this description, the architect's philosophy of building is best expressed by the idea that D. a house is a machine for living. This concept aligns with the functional and efficient design principles evident in the building's minimalist aesthetic and emphasis on practicality."
