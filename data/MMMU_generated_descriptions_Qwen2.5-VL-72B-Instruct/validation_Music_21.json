    "options": "['perfect 4th', 'major 9th/ compound major 2nd', 'augmented 5th', 'perfect unison']",

    "description": "The provided images show two pages of an orchestral score in the key of D major (as indicated by the two sharps in the key signature). The first page includes the beginning of the piece with various instruments listed: Flutes I-III, Oboes I-II, Clarinets in A I-II, Bassoons I-II, Horns in F I-IV, Violins I-II, Violas, Cellos, and Double Basses. The tempo marking at the top reads \"Moderato con anima\" with a metronome mark of \u2669 = 100.\n\nIn the second image, which starts from bar 10, the focus shifts to the continuation of the orchestral piece. The instruments are similarly listed, but now we see more specific details about their parts. At bar 11A, there is a significant interaction between the third horn and the second violins. The third horn plays a note that is a major 9th or a compound major 2nd above the note played by the second violins. This interval is clearly marked with a bracket connecting the two notes, indicating this harmonic relationship.\n\nGiven this detailed description, the correct answer to the question is:\n\n**B. major 9th/ compound major 2nd**"
