    "question": "<image 1> A major food manufacturer is concerned that the sales for its skinny french fries have been decreasing. As a part of a feasibility study, the company conducts research into the types of fries sold across the country to determine if the type of fries sold is independent of the area of the country. The results of the study are shown in Table 11.43. Conduct a test of independence. At the 5% significance level, what can you conclude?",
    "options": "['There is insufficient evidence that types of fries and location are dependent.', 'There is sufficient evidence that types of fries and location are dependent.', 'Not certain.']",

    "description": "The image presents a table labeled \"Table 11.43,\" which displays data on the sales of three types of fries\u2014skinny fries, curly fries, and steak fries\u2014in four different regions of the country: Northeast, South, Central, and West. The table is organized with the types of fries listed in the first column and the regions listed at the top of each subsequent column. The numerical values in the table represent the sales figures (presumably in units or dollars) for each type of fry in each region.\n\nHere's the detailed breakdown of the sales data:\n\n- **Skinny Fries:**\n  - Northeast: 70\n  - South: 50\n  - Central: 20\n  - West: 25\n\n- **Curly Fries:**\n  - Northeast: 100\n  - South: 60\n  - Central: 15\n  - West: 30\n\n- **Steak Fries:**\n  - Northeast: 20\n  - South: 40\n  - Central: 10\n  - West: 10\n\nThis table provides the necessary data to conduct a chi-square test of independence to determine whether the type of fries sold is independent of the region. The test will involve calculating expected frequencies under the assumption of independence and comparing them to the observed frequencies provided in the table. The conclusion will depend on the calculated p-value relative to the 5% significance level."
