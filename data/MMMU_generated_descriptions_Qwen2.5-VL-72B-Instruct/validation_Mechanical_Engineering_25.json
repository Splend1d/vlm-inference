    "description": "The image depicts a flat aluminum alloy bar fixed at both ends, labeled as points A and C. The bar is divided into two segments: AB and BC. \n\n- **Segment AB**:\n  - This segment has a length of \\( \\frac{L}{2} \\), where \\( L = 3 \\) ft.\n  - It has a slight taper, meaning its width changes along its length.\n  - At point A, the width \\( b_2 \\) is 2.5 inches.\n  - At point B, the width \\( b_1 \\) is 2 inches.\n  - The thickness \\( t \\) of the bar is given as \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) inch.\n  \n- **Segment BC**:\n  - This segment also has a length of \\( \\frac{L}{2} \\), making it 1.5 ft long.\n  - It is uniform in width, with \\( b_1 = 2 \\) inches throughout.\n  - The thickness \\( t \\) remains \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) inch.\n\n- **Material Properties**:\n  - Young's modulus \\( E \\) is 10,400 ksi.\n  - Coefficient of thermal expansion \\( \\alpha \\) is \\( 13 \\times 10^{-6} / ^\\circ F \\).\n\n- **Temperature Change**:\n  - The temperature of the bar is uniformly increased by \\( \\Delta T = 20^\\circ F \\).\n\n- **Reactions at Points A and C**:\n  - The bar is fixed at both ends, so there will be reactions \\( R_A \\) and \\( R_C \\) at these points due to the thermal expansion.\n\nThe objective is to determine the reactions \\( R_A \\) and \\( R_C \\) when the temperature is raised by \\( 20^\\circ F \\). The options provided for the reactions are:\nA. \\( R_A = R_C = -2.429 \\) kips\nB. \\( R_A = R_C = -1.429 \\) kips\nC. \\( R_A = R_C = -0.429 \\) kips\n\nThe image provides all necessary dimensions, material properties, and conditions required to solve for the reactions at points A and C."
