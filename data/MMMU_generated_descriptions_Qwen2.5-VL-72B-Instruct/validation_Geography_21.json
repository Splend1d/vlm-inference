    "description": "The image is a stacked bar chart displaying the percentage of species categorized into different danger levels for various animal groups and plants. The x-axis lists the categories: Mammals, Birds, Reptiles, Amphibians, Fishes, and Plants. The y-axis represents \"All species, percent,\" ranging from 0 to 30%.\n\nEach category has a stacked bar divided into three segments, each represented by a distinct color:\n- **Yellow** represents the top segment of each bar.\n- **Blue** represents the middle segment.\n- **Orange** represents the bottom segment.\n\nThe legend in the upper left corner of the chart matches these colors with labels:\n- Yellow corresponds to \"Vulnerable.\"\n- Blue corresponds to \"Endangered.\"\n- Orange corresponds to \"Critical.\"\n\nThe bars show varying percentages for each group, with the segments indicating the proportion of species within each danger level. For example, for Mammals, the yellow (Vulnerable) segment is the largest, followed by the blue (Endangered) segment, and then the orange (Critical) segment.\n\nBased on this description, the correct answer to the question is:\n\nA. Vulnerable, Endangered, Critical"
