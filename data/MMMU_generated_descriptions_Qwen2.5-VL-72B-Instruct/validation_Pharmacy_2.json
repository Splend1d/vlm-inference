    "question": "An 82-year-old woman presents to the office with a 1-year history of worsening cough and shortness of breath. She has a 45 pack-year history of cigarette smoking and quit smoking 15 years ago. Vital signs reveal: <image 1>. ECG findings are normal. Her FEV1/FVC ratio is 65% of predicted. The most appropriate inhaled medication for this patient works by blocking which of the following receptors?",
    "options": "['$\\\\beta $1-adrenergic receptors', 'glucocorticoid receptors', 'histamine H1 receptors', 'leukotriene receptors', 'muscarinic receptors']",
    "id": "validation_Pharmacy_2",
    "description": "The image provides the following vital sign measurements:\n\n- **Temperature:** 36.8\u00b0C (98.2\u00b0F)\n- **Blood pressure:** 140/90 mmHg\n- **Heart rate:** 105/min\n- **Oxygen saturation (at rest):** 92% on room air\n- **Oxygen saturation (walking):** 84% on room air\n\nThese values indicate the patient's physiological status at rest and during activity. The temperature is within the normal range, blood pressure is slightly elevated, heart rate is higher than the typical resting rate, and oxygen saturation decreases significantly when the patient is walking, suggesting potential respiratory issues."
