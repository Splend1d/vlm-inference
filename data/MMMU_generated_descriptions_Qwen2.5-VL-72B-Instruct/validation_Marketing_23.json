    "description": "The image shows a table with five columns containing numerical values representing time in minutes. The rows represent individual observations or data points. Here's a detailed breakdown:\n\n- **Column 1:** Contains the values: 0.50, 1.75, 2, 2.25, 2.25, 2.5, 2.75, 3.25, 3.75, 3.75.\n- **Column 2:** Contains the values: 4.25, 4.25, 4.25, 4.25, 4.5, 4.75, 4.75, 4.75, 5, 5.\n- **Column 3:** Contains the values: 5, 5.25, 5.25, 5.5, 5.5, 5.5, 5.75, 5.75, 6, 6.\n- **Column 4:** Contains the values: 6, 6, 6.25, 6.25, 6.5, 6.5, 6.5, 6.75, 6.75, 6.75.\n- **Column 5:** Contains the values: 7.25, 7.25, 7.25, 7.75, 8, 8.25, 9.5, 9.5, 9.75, 10.75.\n\nTo determine the cumulative relative frequency for waiting less than 6.1 minutes, we need to count all the values in the table that are less than 6.1 minutes and divide by the total number of observations.\n\nThere are 50 data points in total (10 rows x 5 columns).\n\nValues less than 6.1 minutes:\n- From Column 1: All 10 values.\n- From Column 2: All 10 values.\n- From Column 3: 8 values (all except the last two).\n- From Column 4: 3 values (the first three).\n\nTotal values less than 6.1 minutes: 10 + 10 + 8 + 3 = 31.\n\nCumulative relative frequency = 31 / 50 = 0.62.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. 0.62."
