    "options": "['Major seventh in third inversion', 'Dominant seventh in second inversion', 'Major/minor seventh in third inversion', 'Minor seventh in second inversion']",

    "description": "The image shows a musical notation with a treble clef, a time signature of 4/4, and a key signature with two sharps (F# and C#). The chord depicted consists of four notes: G, B, D, and F#. These notes are arranged in such a way that the lowest note is D, followed by F#, then G, and finally B at the top. This arrangement indicates that the chord is in its third inversion. The chord itself is a major seventh chord because it includes a major triad (G-B-D) with an added major seventh interval (G to F#). Therefore, the chord is a G major seventh chord in third inversion."
