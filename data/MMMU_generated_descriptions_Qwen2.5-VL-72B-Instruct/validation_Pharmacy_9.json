    "options": "['a', 'b', 'same of the two']",
    "id": "validation_Pharmacy_9",
    "description": "The image consists of two labeled sections: (a) and (b). \n\nIn section (a), there is a clear glass jar placed upright on a small wooden table. The jar is filled with colorful spherical objects, which appear to be marbles or candies. These objects are neatly contained within the jar, and none are visible outside it. The table and its surroundings are clean and free of any additional items.\n\nIn section (b), the same type of clear glass jar is shown, but this time it is lying on its side on the same kind of wooden table. The colorful spherical objects previously inside the jar are now scattered around the table and on the floor beneath it. Some of these objects remain near the jar, while others are spread out further away. The table and its immediate area are no longer tidy due to the spilled contents.\n\nBased on this description, the question asks which picture appears to have more order."
