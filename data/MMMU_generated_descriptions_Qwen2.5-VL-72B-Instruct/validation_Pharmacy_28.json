    "description": "The image depicts a molecular structure with a central carbon atom (black) bonded to three other atoms. Two of these atoms are red, representing oxygen, and one is gray, representing a carbon. One of the oxygen atoms is double-bonded to the central carbon, while the other oxygen atom is single-bonded to the central carbon and also single-bonded to a hydrogen atom (not explicitly shown but implied). The gray carbon atom is single-bonded to the central carbon and has three additional single bonds to hydrogen atoms (also not explicitly shown but implied).\n\nThis structure indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH), where the central carbon is bonded to an oxygen double bond and a hydroxyl group (-OH). The compound shown is acetic acid, which has the formula CH\u2083COOH. The functional group present is the carboxylic acid group."
