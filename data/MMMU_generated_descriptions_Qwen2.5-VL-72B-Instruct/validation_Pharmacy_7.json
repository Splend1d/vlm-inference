    "description": "The image consists of three labeled graphs: (A), (B), and (C). Each graph is plotted on a grid with x-axis values ranging from 0 to 5 and y-axis values ranging from 0 to 5.\n\n- **Graph (A)**: This graph shows a straight line starting from the origin (0,0) and extending diagonally upwards to the point (5,5). The line has a consistent positive slope, indicating a linear relationship between the x and y values.\n\n- **Graph (B)**: This graph displays a horizontal line at y = 4, spanning from x = 0 to x = 5. The line remains flat, indicating no change in the y-value regardless of the x-value. This represents a constant function where the slope is zero.\n\n- **Graph (C)**: This graph depicts a curve that starts at the point (0,5) and gradually decreases as it moves to the right, approaching but not touching the x-axis. The curve becomes flatter as it extends towards the right side of the graph, indicating a decreasing slope.\n\nBased on these descriptions:\n\n- Graph (A) has a constant positive slope.\n- Graph (B) has a constant slope of zero.\n- Graph (C) does not have a constant slope; its slope changes as the curve flattens.\n\nTherefore, the graphs with a constant slope are (A) and (B)."
