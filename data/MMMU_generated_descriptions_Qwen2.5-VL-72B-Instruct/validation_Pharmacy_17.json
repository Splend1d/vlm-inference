    "description": "The image displays two distinct molecular structures. The top part of the image shows two cyclic peptides. Each peptide consists of four amino acids: N-Methyl-Glycine (N-Me-Gly), L-Valine (L-Val), L-Proline (L-Pro), and D-Valine (D-Val). These peptides form a ring structure with amide bonds connecting the amino acids. \n\nBelow the cyclic peptides, there is a tricyclic system depicted. This system features three interconnected rings. The central ring is a six-membered ring containing a nitrogen atom and an oxygen atom. Attached to this central ring are two five-membered rings, each containing a nitrogen atom. The tricyclic system also includes several methyl groups (Me) and an amino group (NH2).\n\nThe overall structure combines the two cyclic peptides with the tricyclic system, forming a complex molecule. This specific arrangement of cyclic peptides and a tricyclic system is characteristic of a particular antibiotic compound."
