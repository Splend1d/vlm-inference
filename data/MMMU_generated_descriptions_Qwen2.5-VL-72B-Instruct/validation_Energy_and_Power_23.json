    "question": "The tank in Fig. P2.63 has a 4-cmdiameter plug which will pop out if the hydrostatic force on it reaches 25 N. For 20\u00b0C fluids, what will be the reading h on the manometer when this happens? <image 1>",

    "description": "The image depicts a schematic diagram of a tank containing water with a plug at an inclined position. The tank is connected to a U-tube manometer filled with mercury. Here's a detailed breakdown:\n\n- **Tank Configuration**: \n   - The tank is partially filled with water.\n   - There is a plug located at the bottom right corner of the tank. The plug is circular with a diameter (D) of 4 cm.\n   - The plug is positioned at an angle of 50 degrees relative to the horizontal surface of the tank.\n\n- **Manometer Details**:\n   - A U-tube manometer is connected to the tank on the left side.\n   - The manometer contains mercury, and the height difference between the mercury levels in the two arms of the manometer is denoted by 'h'.\n   - The distance from the bottom of the tank to the point where the manometer connects is given as 2 cm.\n\n- **Key Dimensions and Parameters**:\n   - The diameter of the plug: D = 4 cm.\n   - The angle of inclination of the plug: 50 degrees.\n   - The height difference in the manometer: 'h' (to be determined).\n   - The distance from the bottom of the tank to the manometer connection: 2 cm.\n\n- **Objective**:\n   - Determine the value of 'h' when the hydrostatic force on the plug reaches 25 N.\n   - The fluids involved are water and mercury at 20\u00b0C.\n\nThis setup allows for the calculation of the pressure exerted by the water column on the plug and its relationship with the manometer reading 'h'. The specific gravity or density values for water and mercury at 20\u00b0C would be necessary for precise calculations but are not provided in the image."
