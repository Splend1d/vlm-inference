    "description": "The image depicts a simple phylogenetic tree with five labeled points: 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, representing different organisms or species. These points are connected by lines that converge at four branching nodes labeled A, B, C, and D. \n\n- Point 1 is directly connected to node A.\n- Node A branches into two paths: one leading to point 2 and another leading to node B.\n- Node B further branches into two paths: one leading to point 3 and another leading to node C.\n- Node C branches into two paths: one leading to point 4 and another leading to point 5.\n  \nNodes A, B, C, and D represent hypothetical common ancestors in this tree. The connections between these nodes and the points indicate evolutionary relationships. The most recent common ancestor of any two points would be the last shared node along their respective paths. \n\nFor organisms 1 and 3:\n- Organism 1 connects directly to node A.\n- Organism 3 connects through node B, which is also connected to node A.\n\nTherefore, the most recent common ancestor of organisms 1 and 3 is the node where their paths first converge, which is **node A**."
