    "description": "The image shows an electrical circuit diagram labeled \"Fig. 1.\" The circuit consists of two voltage sources and several resistors connected in a combination of series and parallel configurations. Here's a detailed breakdown:\n\n1. **Voltage Sources:**\n   - A 6-volt (V) battery is located on the left side of the circuit.\n   - A 12-volt (V) battery is located on the right side of the circuit.\n\n2. **Resistors:**\n   - There are five resistors in total, with their values clearly marked:\n     - A 4-ohm resistor is connected directly between the positive terminal of the 6-V battery and a junction point.\n     - A 2-ohm resistor is connected in parallel with the 4-ohm resistor.\n     - A 3-ohm resistor is connected between the junction point mentioned above and another junction point closer to the 12-V battery.\n     - A 1-ohm resistor is connected in parallel with the 3-ohm resistor.\n     - A circuit element labeled \"X\" is connected between the junction point near the 12-V battery and the negative terminal of the 12-V battery. According to the question, this element is specified to be a 2-ohm resistor.\n\n3. **Connections:**\n   - The 6-V battery's negative terminal is connected to the 12-V battery's negative terminal, forming a common ground or reference point for the circuit.\n   - The positive terminals of both batteries are connected to their respective parts of the circuit through the resistors described above.\n\nThis setup forms a complex network where the current from each voltage source will split and combine according to the resistances in the paths available. The goal is to determine the power supplied by the 6-V source when the circuit element X is a 2-ohm resistor."
