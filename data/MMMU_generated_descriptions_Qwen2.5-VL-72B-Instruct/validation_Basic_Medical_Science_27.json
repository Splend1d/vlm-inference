    "description": "The image depicts an anatomical illustration of part of the inner ear, specifically focusing on the vestibular system. The central feature highlighted in the image is labeled \"MACULA,\" which is shown as a small, irregularly shaped structure with a pinkish hue. This macula is situated within a larger blue structure that resembles the utricle, one of the otolith organs in the inner ear. The surrounding area includes what appears to be a network of tubes or canals, likely representing parts of the semicircular canals and other components of the vestibular apparatus. The macula itself is depicted with a layer of sensory hair cells and supporting structures, indicating its role in detecting linear acceleration and head tilt relative to gravity. The background has a bubbly texture, possibly representing the fluid environment (endolymph) within the inner ear. There is no indication of perilymph in this specific depiction."
