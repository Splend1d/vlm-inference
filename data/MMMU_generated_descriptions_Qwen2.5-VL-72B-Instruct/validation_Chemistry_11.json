    "description": "The image is a graph depicting a titration curve with pH values on the vertical axis (ranging from 0 to 14) and volume (presumably of titrant added) on the horizontal axis (ranging from 0 to 60). The curve starts at a low pH value near 1 when no titrant has been added and gradually increases as more titrant is added. There is a sharp increase in pH around the midpoint of the x-axis, specifically at approximately 50 units of volume added, where the curve steepens significantly. This point is labeled as the \"Equivalence point,\" and it occurs at a pH value of about 7. After this point, the pH continues to rise but at a slower rate until it reaches a plateau near pH 12.\n\nThe equivalence point being at pH 7 suggests that the solution becomes neutral at this stage. The initial low pH indicates the presence of an acidic solution before any titrant is added. The sharp rise in pH at the equivalence point suggests a strong change in the concentration of hydrogen ions, which is characteristic of a strong base being added to a weak acid. Therefore, the titration curve represents a strong base being titrated into a weak acid."
