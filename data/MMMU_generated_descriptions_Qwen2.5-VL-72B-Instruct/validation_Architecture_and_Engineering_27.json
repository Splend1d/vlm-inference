    "question": "A surveyor needs to know the distance between points C and B in Figure 2.17. A building obscures the view directly between the two points. Setting up at the end of the building at point A, the surveyor measures the two distances AC and AB, and the interior angle at A. What is the desired distance, CB?<image 1>",

    "description": "The image is a diagram labeled \"FIGURE 2.17 Sketch for Example 2.12.\" It depicts a scenario where a building (labeled \"BLDG\") obstructs the direct line of sight between two points, C and B. The surveyor sets up at point A, which is located at the end of the building. \n\nFrom point A, the surveyor measures the following:\n- The distance from A to C (denoted as side b) is 591.13 feet.\n- The distance from A to B (denoted as side c) is 566.81 feet.\n- The interior angle at point A between sides b and c is 80\u00b030'.\n\nThe goal is to determine the distance between points C and B (denoted as side a), which is obscured by the building. The problem requires using the Law of Cosines to calculate this distance. \n\nThe Law of Cosines formula is:  \n\\[ a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \\cdot \\cos(A) \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( a \\) is the unknown distance between C and B,\n- \\( b = 591.13' \\),\n- \\( c = 566.81' \\),\n- \\( A = 80^\\circ 30' \\).\n\nBy plugging these values into the formula, you can solve for \\( a \\)."
