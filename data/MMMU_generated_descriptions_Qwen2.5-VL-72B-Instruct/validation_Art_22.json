    "question": "Evelyn De Morgan often used literary sources to inspire her artworks. Which book featuring mermaids might have inspired her painting <image 1>?",
    "options": "['The Water Babies by Charles Kingsley (1863)', 'The Little Mermaid by Hans Christian Andersen (1836)', 'Around the World in 80 Days by Jules Verne (1873)', 'Moby-Dick by Herman Melville (1851)']",
    "id": "validation_Art_22",
    "description": "The image depicts a group of five mermaids emerging from the sea. They are positioned closely together, with their upper bodies visible above the waterline. Each mermaid has long, flowing hair and is depicted with a serene expression. Their skin tones vary slightly, and they appear to be interacting gently with one another, some holding hands or resting their arms on each other's shoulders. The background features a calm ocean with gentle waves, and the horizon is visible with a soft gradient of colors suggesting either sunrise or sunset. The overall atmosphere of the painting is tranquil and ethereal, emphasizing the mythical nature of the mermaids.\n\nThe mermaids' tails are partially submerged in the water, and the scales are faintly visible, blending into the blue hues of the sea. The painting style is detailed and realistic, capturing the textures of the water and the human-like features of the mermaids. The scene does not include any modern elements or references to specific locations, focusing entirely on the mythical creatures and their interaction with the natural environment.\n\nGiven the focus on mermaids and the serene, mythical atmosphere, the painting aligns closely with themes found in literature that prominently features mermaids. The image does not contain any elements related to travel around the world, whaling, or other non-mythical themes. Therefore, the most likely literary source that could have inspired this painting is one that prominently features mermaids."
