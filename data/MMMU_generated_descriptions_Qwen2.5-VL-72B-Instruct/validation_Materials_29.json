    "description": "The image presents a table with data for three hypothetical alloys labeled A, B, and C. The table includes the following columns:\n\n- **Alloy**: Lists the alloy labels (A, B, C).\n- **Atomic Weight (g/mol)**: Provides the atomic weights for each alloy.\n    - Alloy A has an atomic weight of 43.1 g/mol.\n    - Alloy B has an atomic weight of 184.4 g/mol.\n    - Alloy C has an atomic weight of 91.6 g/mol.\n- **Density (g/cm\u00b3)**: Lists the densities for each alloy.\n    - Alloy A has a density of 6.40 g/cm\u00b3.\n    - Alloy B has a density of 12.30 g/cm\u00b3.\n    - Alloy C has a density of 9.60 g/cm\u00b3.\n- **Atomic Radius (nm)**: Provides the atomic radii for each alloy.\n    - Alloy A has an atomic radius of 0.122 nm.\n    - Alloy B has an atomic radius of 0.146 nm.\n    - Alloy C has an atomic radius of 0.137 nm.\n\nThis information is necessary to determine the crystal structure of Alloy B (FCC, BCC, or SC) using the provided atomic weight, density, and atomic radius values."
