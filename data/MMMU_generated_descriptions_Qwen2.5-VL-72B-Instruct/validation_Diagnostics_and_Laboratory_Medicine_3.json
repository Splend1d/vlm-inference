    "description": "The image shows a histological section of brain tissue stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). The predominant color is pink, indicating eosinophilic staining of the extracellular matrix and cytoplasm. There are scattered areas of white, which represent regions of necrosis or loss of cellular structure. Within these necrotic areas, there are small, dark red dots scattered throughout, which are characteristic of viral inclusions. These inclusions are consistent with the appearance of Cowdry type A bodies, which are associated with herpes simplex virus infection. The overall pattern of the tissue damage, including the presence of necrosis and viral inclusions, suggests a viral encephalitis.\n\nBased on the description provided, the most likely etiology of this process is:\n\nC. Herpes Simplex encephalitis"
