    "description": "The image shows two chemical structures labeled as (A) and (B).\n\n- **Structure (A):** This structure represents a benzene ring with three substituents:\n  - A nitro group (-NO\u2082) at one position.\n  - A dimethylamino group (-NMe\u2082) at the opposite position relative to the nitro group.\n  - A methyl group (-Me) at another position on the ring.\n\n- **Structure (B):** This structure also represents a benzene ring but with five substituents:\n  - A nitro group (-NO\u2082) at one position.\n  - A dimethylamino group (-NMe\u2082) at the opposite position relative to the nitro group.\n  - Three methyl groups (-Me) distributed around the ring, each at different positions.\n\nBoth structures have a nitro group and a dimethylamino group in opposite positions on the benzene ring, but Structure (B) has additional methyl groups compared to Structure (A). The dipole moment values provided for these structures are:\n- For (A): 6.87 Debye (D)\n- For (B): 4.11 Debye (D)\n\nThese values indicate the difference in dipole moments between the two structures due to the presence or absence of additional methyl groups."
