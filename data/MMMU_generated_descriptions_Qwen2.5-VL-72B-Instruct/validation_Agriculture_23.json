    "question": "<image 1> Examine the detached branches of Gliricidia sepium, a common species used in tropical agroforestry. How does the sickly, yellowed leaves on the left contrast with the normal growth adjacent to it, given that both are part of the same tree? The symptoms are not evenly spread across the crown of the tree. Have you noticed that some of the branches have begun to die?",

    "description": "The image shows several detached branches of Gliricidia sepium lying on a sandy surface. The branches exhibit a clear contrast in leaf health and coloration. On the left side of the image, there are branches with leaves that appear sickly and yellowed, indicating poor health or stress. These yellowed leaves are sparse and smaller compared to the healthy ones. Moving towards the right side of the image, the leaves become progressively greener and healthier-looking, with a vibrant green color and a fuller appearance. This suggests that the symptoms of whatever is affecting the plant are not evenly distributed across the entire crown but are localized primarily on the left side.\n\nSome of the branches, particularly those with the yellowed leaves, show signs of drying out and beginning to die. The transition from unhealthy to healthy leaves is quite distinct, with no gradual change in between. There are no visible signs of fungal spots, lesions, or other typical signs of fungal diseases. Similarly, there are no signs of insect damage or physical trauma that would suggest mechanical injury. The overall pattern of damage\u2014localized yellowing and dying of leaves on certain branches while others remain healthy\u2014could indicate a systemic issue affecting the plant's ability to transport nutrients or water effectively.\n\nGiven these observations, the most likely cause of the symptoms described could be herbicide damage (Option B), as herbicides can cause localized yellowing and death of leaves, especially if applied unevenly. Other options like virus infection, fungus disease, or phytoplasma typically present different symptom patterns or additional signs not observed in this image. Therefore, based on the description, the best answer would be B. Herbicide damage."
