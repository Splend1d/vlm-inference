    "question": "Which of the following testing methods should be used to evaluate the uniformity and compactness of crushed stone fill?<image 1>",
    "options": "['Static penetration test', 'Light power penetration', 'Heavy power penetration', 'Standard penetration test']",

    "description": "The provided image depicts a mechanical setup involving a cylindrical rod or shaft with a threaded section at one end. The shaft appears to be subjected to a torsional force, as indicated by the torque (T) applied at the right-hand side. Additionally, there is a force (F) acting perpendicular to the shaft's axis, suggesting a bending moment. The left-hand side of the shaft is fixed within a support structure, which constrains its movement. The axes x, y, and z are labeled, indicating a three-dimensional coordinate system for reference. \n\nThis image does not provide any information related to evaluating the uniformity and compactness of crushed stone fill. Therefore, it cannot be used to determine the appropriate testing method among the options given in the question. The image is unrelated to soil mechanics or geotechnical engineering tests like the static penetration test, light power penetration, heavy power penetration, or standard penetration test."
