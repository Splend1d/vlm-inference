    "description": "The image depicts an AC circuit diagram labeled as \"Fig. 1.\" The circuit consists of two voltage sources, three impedances (\\(\\overline{Z}_1\\), \\(\\overline{Z}_2\\), and \\(\\overline{Z}_3\\)), and a node \\(n_1\\) where currents \\(\\overline{I}_1\\), \\(\\overline{I}_2\\), and \\(\\overline{I}_3\\) meet. The phasor voltage across impedance \\(\\overline{Z}_3\\) is denoted as \\(\\overline{V}_C\\).\n\nHere are the details:\n\n- **Voltage Sources:**\n  - A voltage source with a magnitude of 100 V and a phase angle of 0\u00b0 (\\(100 \\angle 0^\\circ \\text{V}\\)) is connected to the left side of the circuit.\n  - Another voltage source with a magnitude of 50 V and a phase angle of 90\u00b0 (\\(50 \\angle 90^\\circ \\text{V}\\)) is connected to the right side of the circuit.\n\n- **Impedances:**\n  - \\(\\overline{Z}_1 = 5 \\angle 0^\\circ \\Omega\\)\n  - \\(\\overline{Z}_2 = 10 \\angle 36.9^\\circ \\Omega\\)\n  - \\(\\overline{Z}_3 = 20 \\angle 53.1^\\circ \\Omega\\)\n\n- **Currents:**\n  - \\(\\overline{I}_1\\) flows from the 100 V source through \\(\\overline{Z}_1\\) towards node \\(n_1\\).\n  - \\(\\overline{I}_2\\) flows from node \\(n_1\\) through \\(\\overline{Z}_2\\) towards the 50 V source.\n  - \\(\\overline{I}_3\\) flows downward through \\(\\overline{Z}_3\\) from node \\(n_1\\).\n\n- **Node \\(n_1\\):**\n  - This is the central node where all three currents (\\(\\overline{I}_1\\), \\(\\overline{I}_2\\), and \\(\\overline{I}_3\\)) converge or diverge.\n\n- **Phasor Voltage \\(\\overline{V}_C\\):**\n  - \\(\\overline{V}_C\\) represents the voltage drop across \\(\\overline{Z}_3\\). It is the phasor voltage we need to find the amplitude for.\n\nTo solve for the amplitude of \\(\\overline{V}_C\\), one would typically use Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) at node \\(n_1\\) and Ohm's law in the context of phasors. However, the specific numerical solution is not provided in the description."
