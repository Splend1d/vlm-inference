    "description": "The image depicts a chemical structure of cisplatin, a well-known anticancer drug. The structure shows a central platinum (Pt) atom bonded to two ammonia (NH\u2083) molecules and two chloride (Cl) ions. The arrangement is such that the two chloride ions and the two ammonia molecules are in a square planar configuration around the platinum atom. The chloride ions are positioned trans to each other, meaning they are directly opposite each other across the platinum atom. The ammonia molecules are also trans to each other. This specific arrangement is crucial for the drug's mechanism of action."
