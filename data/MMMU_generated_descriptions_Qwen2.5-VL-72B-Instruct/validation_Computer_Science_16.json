    "description": "The image depicts a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) representing an arithmetic expression. The graph consists of nodes connected by directed edges, where each node represents either an operation or a variable. Here's a detailed breakdown:\n\n- There are two input variables labeled 'x' and 'y'.\n- The graph includes several operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), and multiplication (*).\n- The structure of the graph is as follows:\n  - Two '+' nodes represent addition operations.\n  - Two '-' nodes represent subtraction operations.\n  - One '*' node represents a multiplication operation.\n  - The connections between these nodes and the variables 'x' and 'y' form the expression represented by the DAG.\n\nSpecifically:\n- The first '+' node combines 'x' and 'y'.\n- The result of this addition is used in two places:\n  - It is subtracted from another value in one '-' node.\n  - It is multiplied with the result of 'x - y' in the '*' node.\n- The second '+' node combines the results of the two '-' nodes.\n- The final '-' node subtracts the result of the multiplication from the result of the first addition.\n\nBased on the structure and connections, the DAG represents the expression:  \n**((x + y) - ((x + y) * (x - y))) + ((x + y) * (x - y))**\n\nThis corresponds to option **D** in the given question."
