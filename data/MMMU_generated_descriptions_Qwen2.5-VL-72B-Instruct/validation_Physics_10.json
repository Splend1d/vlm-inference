    "question": "<image 1>A sphere of mass m1, which is attached to a spring, is displaced downward from its equilibrium position as shown above left and released from rest. A sphere of mass m2, which is suspended from a string of length L, is displaced to the right as shown above right and released from rest so that it swings as a simple pendulum with small amplitude. Assume that both spheres undergo simple harmonic motion Which of the following is true for both spheres?",
    "options": "['The maximum kinetic energy is attained as the sphere passes through its equilibrium position.', 'The minimum gravitational potential energy is attained as the sphere passes through its equilibrium position.', 'The maximum gravitational potential energy is attained when the sphere reaches its point of release.', 'The maximum total energy is attained only as the sphere passes through its equilibrium position.']",

    "description": "The image consists of two diagrams illustrating two different physical systems undergoing simple harmonic motion (SHM).\n\n### Left Diagram:\n- **System:** A sphere of mass \\( m_1 \\) is attached to a vertical spring.\n- **Equilibrium Position:** The sphere is at rest when the spring is neither stretched nor compressed, and this position is labeled as the \"Equilibrium Position.\"\n- **Point of Release:** The sphere is displaced downward from the equilibrium position and then released from rest. This new position is labeled as the \"Point of Release,\" indicating that the spring is stretched beyond its equilibrium length.\n- **Motion:** When released, the sphere oscillates vertically up and down about the equilibrium position due to the restoring force provided by the spring.\n\n### Right Diagram:\n- **System:** A sphere of mass \\( m_2 \\) is suspended from a string of length \\( L \\), forming a simple pendulum.\n- **Equilibrium Position:** The sphere hangs vertically below the point of suspension when at rest, and this position is labeled as the \"Equilibrium Position.\"\n- **Point of Release:** The sphere is displaced to the right from the equilibrium position and then released from rest. This new position is labeled as the \"Point of Release,\" indicating that the pendulum is at an angle from the vertical.\n- **Motion:** When released, the sphere swings back and forth in a small arc about the equilibrium position due to the restoring force provided by gravity acting along the tangential direction of the arc.\n\n### Key Observations:\n- Both systems exhibit SHM, meaning their displacement, velocity, and acceleration vary periodically with time.\n- In both cases, the equilibrium position is where the net restoring force is zero.\n- The point of release represents the maximum displacement from the equilibrium position for each system.\n\n### Energy Considerations:\n- **Kinetic Energy:** Maximum kinetic energy occurs when the speed is greatest, which happens at the equilibrium position for both systems.\n- **Gravitational Potential Energy:** For the pendulum (\\( m_2 \\)), the highest gravitational potential energy is at the point of release (highest point). For the spring-mass system (\\( m_1 \\)), the gravitational potential energy changes but is not the dominant factor compared to the elastic potential energy of the spring.\n- **Total Energy:** The total mechanical energy (sum of kinetic, gravitational potential, and elastic potential energies) remains constant throughout the motion for both systems, assuming no dissipative forces like friction or air resistance.\n\nWith these details, one can analyze the given options in the question based purely on the described image content."
