    "description": "The image depicts a periodic square wave function \\( f(t) \\) plotted against time \\( t \\). The waveform has the following characteristics:\n\n- The amplitude of the waveform is constant at 1.\n- The period of the waveform is denoted by \\( T \\).\n- Within each period \\( T \\), the waveform is non-zero for half the period, specifically from \\( t = 0 \\) to \\( t = T/2 \\), and zero for the other half, from \\( t = T/2 \\) to \\( t = T \\).\n- The waveform repeats itself every \\( T \\) units of time.\n\nThe waveform can be described mathematically as follows:\n\\[ f(t) = \n\\begin{cases} \n1 & \\text{for } 0 \\leq t < T/2 \\\\\n0 & \\text{for } T/2 \\leq t < T \n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nand this pattern repeats periodically with period \\( T \\).\n\nThis description should enable someone to determine the Laplace transform of the given periodic waveform."
