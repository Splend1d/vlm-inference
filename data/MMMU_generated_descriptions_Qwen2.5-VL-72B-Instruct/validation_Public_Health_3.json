    "description": "The image presents data from a study assessing the effectiveness of a newly developed hepatitis A vaccine among 7-year-old susceptible children in a village. The study involved two groups: a vaccination group and a control group, each consisting of 500 individuals. \n\n- **Vaccination Group**: This group consisted of 500 children who received the hepatitis A vaccine. After a 3-year follow-up period, only 1 case of hepatitis A was observed.\n  \n- **Control Group**: This group also consisted of 500 children but did not receive the vaccine. Over the same 3-year follow-up period, 10 cases of hepatitis A were recorded.\n\nThe table provides the total number of persons in each group (500 for both) and the corresponding number of hepatitis A cases (1 in the vaccination group and 10 in the control group). The primary focus of the study appears to be comparing the occurrence of hepatitis A between vaccinated and unvaccinated children over time."
