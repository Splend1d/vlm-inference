    "question": "The cardiovascular protective effects of fruit intake have been widely demonstrated in Western populations, but little is known about the association in China, where fruit intake levels are low and the incidence of stroke is high. To investigate whether this association also exists in the Chinese population, the University of Oxford (UK), in collaboration with Professor Li Liming's group at the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (CAMS), recruited 512,891 adults aged 30-79 years from 10 different regions of China (including five cities and five villages) between June 2004 and July 2008, to investigate the association between the use of fresh fruits and major cardiovascular diseases in the Chinese population. The study investigated the relationship between fresh fruit use and major cardiovascular diseases in the Chinese population. Five frequency criteria were set for the main exposure factor \"fruit intake\": \"never eat fruit\", \"once a month\", \"1-3 times a week\", \"4-6 times a week\", \"every day \", which were filled in by the respondents themselves.The primary cardiovascular disease death was used as the outcome event in this study. Survival and health status of all subjects were regularly reported to the disease surveillance system of the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and their data were checked against the health insurance records of the investigated subjects' localities and confirmed by the street or village committees. Coding was based on the 10th edition of the International Classification of Diseases.After 3.2 million person-years of follow-up, a total of 451,665 subjects completed the follow-up after excluding lost and ineligible subjects. Those who consumed fresh fruit daily were found to have a mean reduction in systolic blood pressure of about 4 mmHg, a reduction in blood glucose of about 0.5 mmol/L, a 40% reduction in the risk of cardiovascular death, and a 34%, 25%, and 36% reduction in the risk of major coronary heart disease events, ischemic strokes, and cerebral hemorrhages, respectively, when compared with those who consumed very little fresh fruit. Their fruit intake and cardiovascular disease profiles were shown in the table below.<image 1>What indicators were appropriate for describing the risk of morbidity in various groups of the population?",
    "options": "['point prevalence and period prevalence', 'mortality rate and case fatality rate', 'cumulative incidence and incidence density', 'PYLL and DALY']",

    "description": "The image presents a table summarizing the relationship between fruit intake frequency and the number of deaths from cardiovascular disease (CVD) among a large cohort of Chinese adults. The table includes two columns: \"Number of observers\" and \"Number of deaths from CVD,\" corresponding to five categories of fruit intake frequency:\n\n1. **Never eat fruit**: \n   - Number of observers: 28,479\n   - Number of deaths from CVD: 735\n\n2. **Once a month**:\n   - Number of observers: 156,098\n   - Number of deaths from CVD: 2,341\n\n3. **1-3 times a week**:\n   - Number of observers: 143,183\n   - Number of deaths from CVD: 1,375\n\n4. **4-6 times a week**:\n   - Number of observers: 42,519\n   - Number of deaths from CVD: 270\n\n5. **Every day**:\n   - Number of observers: 81,386\n   - Number of deaths from CVD: 452\n\nThe table also includes a \"Total\" row, though the specific values for the total are not provided in the description. \n\nThis table provides the necessary data to calculate measures of morbidity and mortality associated with different levels of fruit consumption. Specifically, it allows for the calculation of mortality rates (deaths per unit of population) and case fatality rates (proportion of deaths among those affected). Therefore, the appropriate indicators for describing the risk of morbidity in various groups of the population, based on this table, would be **mortality rate and case fatality rate**."
