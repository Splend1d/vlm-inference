    "description": "The image shows a scatter plot with three data points plotted on a coordinate system. The horizontal axis is labeled \"x,\" and the vertical axis is labeled \"h(x).\" The x-axis ranges from 0 to 3, and the h(x)-axis ranges from 0 to 3. There are three red 'x' marks representing the data points:\n\n1. The first point is at (1, 1).\n2. The second point is at (2, 2).\n3. The third point is at (3, 3).\n\nThese points indicate the values of \\( x \\) and their corresponding \\( h(x) \\) values in the dataset. The question involves calculating the cost function \\( J(\\theta_1) \\) for \\( \\theta_1 = 0 \\), using the given hypothesis \\( h_{\\theta}(x) = \\theta_1 x \\)."
