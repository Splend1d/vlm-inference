    "description": "The image shows an electrocardiogram (ECG) waveform plotted on a grid background. The waveform consists of several labeled points and segments:\n\n- **P wave**: This is the first visible upward deflection in the waveform. It is relatively small and smooth.\n- **QRS complex**: This follows the P wave and is characterized by a sharp downward deflection (Q), a tall, prominent peak (R), and another downward deflection (S). The QRS complex is the most pronounced part of the waveform.\n- **T wave**: This appears after the QRS complex and is an upward deflection that is less sharp than the R peak but more pronounced than the P wave.\n\nThe labels on the waveform indicate the following:\n- **P** marks the beginning of the P wave.\n- **Q** marks the start of the QRS complex.\n- **R** marks the peak of the QRS complex.\n- **S** marks the end of the QRS complex.\n- **T** marks the peak of the T wave.\n\nThe P wave, QRS complex, and T wave are distinct parts of the ECG waveform, each representing different phases of cardiac electrical activity."
