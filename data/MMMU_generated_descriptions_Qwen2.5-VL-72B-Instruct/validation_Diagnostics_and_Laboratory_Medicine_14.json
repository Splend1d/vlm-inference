    "description": "The image shows a histological section of the spinal cord stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). The overall structure appears to be divided into two symmetrical halves by a prominent midline cleft that extends vertically through the center of the spinal cord. This cleft is filled with what appears to be cerebrospinal fluid, as indicated by its clear appearance in contrast to the surrounding tissue. The spinal cord tissue on either side of the cleft is relatively uniform in color and texture, suggesting normal neural tissue. There are no visible signs of cystic formations or dilations within the substance of the spinal cord itself, nor are there any apparent disruptions or malformations of the surrounding structures. The division of the spinal cord into two distinct halves by this midline cleft is characteristic of a specific condition."
