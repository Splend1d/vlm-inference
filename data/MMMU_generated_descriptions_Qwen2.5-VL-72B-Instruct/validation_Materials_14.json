    "description": "The image depicts a cylindrical object with an outer diameter of 100 mm and an inner diameter of 80 mm, indicating it is a hollow cylinder or a ring-shaped cross-section. A force of 300 kN is applied vertically downward at the center of the top surface of this cylinder. The label \"F1-8\" is present below the diagram, which might refer to a figure number in a textbook or problem set.\n\nTo determine the average normal stress developed on the cross-section:\n\n1. **Calculate the cross-sectional area**:\n   - The cross-section is annular (ring-shaped).\n   - The outer radius \\( R \\) is 50 mm (half of 100 mm).\n   - The inner radius \\( r \\) is 40 mm (half of 80 mm).\n   - The area \\( A \\) of the annular cross-section is given by: \n     \\[\n     A = \\pi (R^2 - r^2)\n     \\]\n     Substituting the values:\n     \\[\n     A = \\pi ((50 \\text{ mm})^2 - (40 \\text{ mm})^2) = \\pi (2500 \\text{ mm}^2 - 1600 \\text{ mm}^2) = \\pi \\times 900 \\text{ mm}^2 = 2827.43 \\text{ mm}^2\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the average normal stress**:\n   - The applied force \\( F \\) is 300 kN.\n   - The average normal stress \\( \\sigma \\) is given by:\n     \\[\n     \\sigma = \\frac{F}{A}\n     \\]\n     Substituting the values:\n     \\[\n     \\sigma = \\frac{300 \\times 10^3 \\text{ N}}{2827.43 \\text{ mm}^2} = \\frac{300 \\times 10^3 \\text{ N}}{2827.43 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}^2} = 105.99 \\text{ MPa}\n     \\]\n\nHowever, this value does not match any of the provided options. Rechecking the calculations and ensuring units are consistent is crucial. Given the options, the closest reasonable value would be recalculated or rechecked for any potential unit conversion errors. \n\nFor sketching the normal stress distribution:\n- The normal stress will be uniformly distributed across the annular cross-section since the load is centrally applied and the material is assumed homogeneous and isotropic. Thus, the stress distribution will be constant throughout the cross-section."
