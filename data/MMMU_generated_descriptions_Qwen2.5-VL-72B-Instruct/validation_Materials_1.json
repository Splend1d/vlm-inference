    "question": "Determine the shape factor for the cross section of the H-beam. <image 1>",
    "options": "['1.17', '1.57', '0.87']",
    "id": "validation_Materials_1",
    "description": "The image depicts a cross-sectional view of an H-beam with specific dimensions provided. The overall height of the beam is 200 mm, and the width of the flanges (the horizontal parts) is also 200 mm. The thickness of both the flanges and the web (the vertical part connecting the flanges) is 20 mm. \n\nThe moment of plastic resistance \\( M_p \\) is indicated at the center of the web, suggesting that this is the point where the plastic moment capacity is being considered. The shape factor is a property related to the cross-section geometry and is defined as the ratio of the plastic moment capacity \\( M_p \\) to the elastic moment capacity \\( M_e \\).\n\nTo determine the shape factor, one would typically calculate the plastic moment capacity \\( M_p \\) and the elastic moment capacity \\( M_e \\), then divide \\( M_p \\) by \\( M_e \\). However, the exact numerical values for these capacities are not provided in the image, so the shape factor cannot be directly calculated from the given information alone. \n\nThe options provided for the shape factor are A. 1.17, B. 1.57, and C. 0.87. Without additional calculations or reference data, it is not possible to definitively select the correct answer based solely on the image description."
