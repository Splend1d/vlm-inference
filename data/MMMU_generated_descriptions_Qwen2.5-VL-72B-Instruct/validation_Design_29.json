    "question": "Works like the one (<image 1>) shown from Micronesia utilized abstract geometric lines and shapes because they functioned to record",

    "description": "The image depicts an intricate rectangular framework constructed from thin, light brown bamboo sticks. The structure features a grid-like pattern with horizontal and vertical bamboo pieces forming a series of squares. Diagonal bamboo sticks crisscross within this grid, creating a complex network of intersecting lines. Small white beads or stones are placed at various points where the bamboo sticks meet, adding a decorative element and possibly serving as markers. The overall design is abstract and geometric, with no immediately recognizable figures or symbols. The arrangement suggests a functional purpose beyond mere decoration, likely related to navigation or mapping due to its structured and systematic layout. \n\nGiven the description, the work utilizes abstract geometric lines and shapes to record **D. ocean currents and landforms**. This type of artifact is known as a \"rebbelib\" or \"stick chart,\" traditionally used by Micronesian navigators to map ocean currents, wave patterns, and islands for maritime navigation."
