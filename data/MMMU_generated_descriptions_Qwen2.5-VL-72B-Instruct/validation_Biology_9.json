    "question": "You discover a transmembrane protein ALPHA that, like most transmembrane proteins, exhibits a transmembrane domain composed of alpha helices. You next discover that ALPHA serves as a channel. What is a likely amino acid sequence for some portion of the transmembrane domain?  (See <image 1> for one-letter abbreviations)",

    "description": "The image is a table listing the standard abbreviations and one-letter codes for all 20 common amino acids plus two additional rare ones. The table has three columns:\n\n1. **Abbreviation**: This column lists the three-letter abbreviations for each amino acid.\n2. **1 letter abbreviation**: This column provides the single-letter code corresponding to each amino acid.\n3. **Amino acid name**: This column gives the full name of each amino acid.\n\nHere's the complete list from the table:\n\n- Ala (A): Alanine\n- Arg (R): Arginine\n- Asn (N): Asparagine\n- Asp (D): Aspartic acid\n- Cys (C): Cysteine\n- Gln (Q): Glutamine\n- Glu (E): Glutamic acid\n- Gly (G): Glycine\n- His (H): Histidine\n- Ile (I): Isoleucine\n- Leu (L): Leucine\n- Lys (K): Lysine\n- Met (M): Methionine\n- Phe (F): Phenylalanine\n- Pro (P): Proline\n- Pyl (O): Pyrrolysine\n- Ser (S): Serine\n- Sec (U): Selenocysteine\n- Thr (T): Threonine\n- Trp (W): Tryptophan\n- Tyr (Y): Tyrosine\n- Val (V): Valine\n\nThis table provides the necessary information to interpret the one-letter abbreviations in the given options for the amino acid sequences."
