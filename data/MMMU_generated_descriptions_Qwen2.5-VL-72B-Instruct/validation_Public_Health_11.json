    "description": "The provided table presents data on the relationship between smoking status (smokers vs. non-smokers) and lung cancer incidence (lung cancer patients vs. non-lung cancer patients). The table is organized into four categories:\n\n- **Smokers with lung cancer:** 150 individuals.\n- **Non-smokers with lung cancer:** 100 individuals.\n- **Smokers without lung cancer:** 50 individuals.\n- **Non-smokers without lung cancer:** 200 individuals.\n\nAdditionally, the table includes totals for each group:\n- Total number of lung cancer patients: 250 (150 smokers + 100 non-smokers).\n- Total number of non-lung cancer patients: 250 (50 smokers + 200 non-smokers).\n\nFrom this data, various epidemiological measures can be calculated, including:\n- **Relative Risk (RR):** Compares the risk of developing lung cancer between smokers and non-smokers.\n- **Odds Ratio (OR):** Compares the odds of having lung cancer between smokers and non-smokers.\n- **Attributable Risk (AR):** Measures the difference in the incidence of lung cancer between smokers and non-smokers.\n- **Population Attributable Risk (PAR):** Measures the proportion of lung cancer cases in the population that can be attributed to smoking.\n\nThus, the data allows for the calculation of all the given options: A. PAR, B. AR, C. RR, and D. OR."
