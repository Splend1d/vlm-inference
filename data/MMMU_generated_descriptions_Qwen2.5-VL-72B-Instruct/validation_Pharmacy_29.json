    "description": "The image shows a structural formula of an organic molecule. The molecule consists of five carbon atoms (C) arranged in a straight chain. Each carbon atom is bonded to hydrogen atoms (H), except for one carbon which has a double bond with an oxygen atom (O). Specifically:\n\n- The first carbon atom (from the left) is bonded to three hydrogen atoms.\n- The second carbon atom is bonded to two hydrogen atoms.\n- The third carbon atom is bonded to one hydrogen atom and has a double bond with an oxygen atom.\n- The fourth carbon atom is bonded to two hydrogen atoms.\n- The fifth carbon atom is bonded to three hydrogen atoms.\n\nThis arrangement indicates that the molecule is a ketone with the carbonyl group (C=O) located at the third position in the carbon chain."
