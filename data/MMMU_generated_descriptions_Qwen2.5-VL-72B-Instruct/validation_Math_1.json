    "description": "The image is a graph labeled \"Fig. 6-1\" depicting a step function, specifically the greatest integer function (also known as the floor function), denoted by \\( [x] \\). The x-axis ranges from -3 to 5, and the y-axis ranges from -3 to 4. The function is represented by horizontal line segments with closed circles at the left endpoints and open circles at the right endpoints, indicating the value of the function at each interval.\n\nHere's a detailed breakdown of the function values:\n\n- For \\( x \\) in the interval \\([-3, -2)\\), the function value is \\(-3\\).\n- For \\( x \\) in the interval \\([-2, -1)\\), the function value is \\(-2\\).\n- For \\( x \\) in the interval \\([-1, 0)\\), the function value is \\(-1\\).\n- For \\( x \\) in the interval \\([0, 1)\\), the function value is \\(0\\).\n- For \\( x \\) in the interval \\([1, 2)\\), the function value is \\(1\\).\n- For \\( x \\) in the interval \\([2, 3)\\), the function value is \\(2\\).\n- For \\( x \\) in the interval \\([3, 4)\\), the function value is \\(3\\).\n- For \\( x \\) in the interval \\([4, 5)\\), the function value is \\(4\\).\n\nAt \\( x = 2 \\), there is an open circle at \\( y = 1 \\) and a closed circle at \\( y = 2 \\), indicating that the function value at \\( x = 2 \\) is \\(2\\).\n\nTo find \\(\\lim_{x \\to 2} [x]\\):\n\n- As \\( x \\) approaches 2 from the left (\\( x \\to 2^- \\)), the function value is \\(1\\).\n- As \\( x \\) approaches 2 from the right (\\( x \\to 2^+ \\)), the function value is \\(2\\).\n\nSince the left-hand limit and the right-hand limit are not equal, the limit does not exist.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\nC. Not exist"
