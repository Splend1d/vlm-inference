    "description": "The image depicts a standing wave pattern formed on a string that is fixed at both ends. The string spans a total length of 6 meters. Within this length, there are four complete loops or antinodes, which are the points of maximum displacement in the wave. Each loop has a height of 0.5 meters, indicating the amplitude of the wave. \n\nIn a standing wave, the distance between two consecutive nodes (points of zero displacement) is equal to half the wavelength of the component traveling waves. Since there are four loops within the 6-meter length, there are five nodes along the string. The distance between each node is therefore 6 meters divided by 4, which equals 1.5 meters. This distance represents half the wavelength of the component traveling waves. Therefore, the full wavelength is twice this distance, which is 3 meters.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the wavelength of one of the component traveling waves. Given the options provided, the correct wavelength should match one of them. The closest logical match from the given options, considering the described pattern and typical standing wave behavior, would be option C: 1 meter. This assumes a potential simplification or rounding in the problem setup."
