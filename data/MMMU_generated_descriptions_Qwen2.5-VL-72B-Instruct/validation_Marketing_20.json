    "description": "The image depicts a standard American roulette betting table layout. The table includes a grid with numbered slots ranging from 0 to 36, plus an additional \"00\" slot, making a total of 38 distinct numbers. Each number is colored either red or black, except for the \"0\" and \"00,\" which are green. \n\nThe numbers are arranged in a specific pattern:\n- The top row contains the \"00\" and \"0\" slots.\n- The subsequent rows contain the numbers 1 through 36, organized into three columns. Each column has 12 numbers, forming what is referred to as the \"1st Dozen,\" \"2nd Dozen,\" and \"3rd Dozen.\"\n- The numbers alternate between red and black within each column, ensuring no two adjacent numbers in a vertical line share the same color.\n\nAt the bottom of the table, there are additional betting options labeled as follows:\n- \"1st Dozen,\" \"2nd Dozen,\" and \"3rd Dozen,\" each covering 12 numbers.\n- \"1 to 18\" and \"19 to 36,\" each covering half of the numbers (18 numbers each).\n- \"EVEN\" and \"ODD,\" each covering all even or odd numbers respectively (18 numbers each).\n\nThe question asks about the probability of winning a bet on three consecutive numbers in a line, such as 1-2-3. Based on the described layout, it's clear that any single number has a 1/38 chance of being selected. Since the bet covers three numbers, the probability of winning this type of bet is 3/38. Therefore, the correct answer is C. 3/38."
