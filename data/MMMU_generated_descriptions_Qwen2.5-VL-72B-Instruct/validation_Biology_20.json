    "question": "Using the oxygen affinity curve in <image 1>, determine the amount of oxygen that would be delivered to cells at PO2 = 20 mmHg if the PO2 of the lungs were 60 mmHg. Assume maximum HbO2 to be the level of oxygen delivery if all available oxygen in the RBC's was transferred to cells.",
    "options": "['17% of the maximum HbO2 would be delivered.', '22% of the maximum HbO2 would be delivered.', '65% of the maximum HbO2 would be delivered.', '70% of the maximum HbO2 would be delivered.', '82% of the maximum HbO2 would be delivered.']",

    "description": "The image is a graph depicting the relationship between oxygen partial pressure (PO\u2082) and oxyhemoglobin saturation (%). The x-axis represents PO\u2082 in millimeters of mercury (mmHg), ranging from 0 to 120 mmHg. The y-axis represents oxyhemoglobin saturation as a percentage, ranging from 0% to 100%.\n\nThe curve on the graph shows an S-shaped (sigmoidal) pattern, which is characteristic of the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve. At low PO\u2082 values, the curve rises steeply, indicating a rapid increase in oxyhemoglobin saturation with small increases in PO\u2082. As PO\u2082 increases further, the curve levels off, approaching 100% saturation.\n\nKey points on the curve:\n- At a PO\u2082 of approximately 20 mmHg, the oxyhemoglobin saturation is around 35%.\n- At a PO\u2082 of approximately 60 mmHg, the oxyhemoglobin saturation is around 90%.\n\nTo determine the amount of oxygen delivered to cells when the PO\u2082 in the lungs is 60 mmHg and the PO\u2082 at the tissue level is 20 mmHg:\n\n1. At 60 mmHg PO\u2082 in the lungs, the hemoglobin is about 90% saturated with oxygen.\n2. At 20 mmHg PO\u2082 in the tissues, the hemoglobin is about 35% saturated with oxygen.\n3. The difference in saturation between these two points represents the amount of oxygen released to the tissues: 90% - 35% = 55%.\n\nTherefore, 55% of the maximum HbO\u2082 would be delivered to the cells under these conditions. However, since this value does not match any of the provided options exactly, we need to find the closest option. The closest option to 55% is:\n\nC. 65% of the maximum HbO\u2082 would be delivered. \n\nThis is the most reasonable choice given the options provided."
