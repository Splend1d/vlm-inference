    "description": "The image depicts a reclining couple, sculpted in a style reminiscent of ancient Etruscan or Greek art. The figures are lying on a kline, which is a type of couch used for dining or reclining. The man is shirtless, with long hair and a beard, while the woman is dressed in a draped garment. Both figures have painted details, including facial features and clothing patterns. The kline they are lying on has ornate carvings and appears to be made of stone. The overall composition suggests a funerary context, as such sculptures were often placed in tombs or necropoli to commemorate the deceased. The figures seem to be in a relaxed, almost celebratory pose, which was common in Etruscan funerary art to depict the afterlife as a continuation of earthly pleasures. \n\nGiven this description, the most likely place where such a work would be found is:\n\nB. a necropolis"
