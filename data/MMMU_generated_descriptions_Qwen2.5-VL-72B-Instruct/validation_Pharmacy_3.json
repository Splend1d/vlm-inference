    "description": "The image illustrates the metabolic pathway of arachidonic acid derived from membrane phospholipids. The process begins with the breakdown of membrane phospholipids (labeled as \"Membrane phospholipid\") to release arachidonic acid. This step is indicated by an arrow labeled \"1.\"\n\nFrom arachidonic acid, two distinct pathways diverge:\n\n1. **Prostaglandins Pathway**: Arachidonic acid is converted into prostaglandins, which are represented by a red cylinder-like structure. This conversion is indicated by an orange arrow labeled \"2.\" Prostaglandins are known to play various roles in inflammation and pain.\n\n2. **Leukotrienes Pathway**: Arachidonic acid is also converted into leukotrienes, specifically LTC\u2084 and LTD\u2084, which are depicted by a blue arrow labeled \"3.\" Leukotrienes are involved in immune responses and can contribute to allergic reactions. The specific leukotrienes mentioned are LTC\u2084 and LTD\u2084.\n\nAdditionally, there is a red box labeled \"4,\" which points towards the leukotrienes (LTC\u2084 and LTD\u2084). This suggests that blocking this step could lead to an increase in leukotriene production, potentially contributing to an allergic response.\n\nIn summary, the image shows that blocking step \"2\" would inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, while blocking step \"4\" would affect leukotriene production, which is associated with allergic responses. Therefore, the step responsible for causing the drug allergy when blocked is step \"4.\""
