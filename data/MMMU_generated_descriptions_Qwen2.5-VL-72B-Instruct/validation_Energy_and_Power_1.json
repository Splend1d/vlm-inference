    "description": "The image depicts a schematic representation of a hemispherical heat source embedded within a silicon substrate. The heat source is shown as a hemisphere with a radius \\( r_o \\), which is specified to be 0.1 mm. This hemisphere is generating heat at a rate denoted by \\( q \\). The silicon substrate surrounding the heat source has a thermal conductivity \\( k \\) of 125 W/m\u00b7K. \n\nThe top surface of the silicon substrate is well-insulated, meaning there is no heat transfer through this surface. All other boundaries of the silicon substrate are maintained at an ambient temperature \\( T_\\infty \\), which is given as 27\u00b0C or 300 K. The question asks for the surface temperature of the hemispherical heat source when the heat dissipation rate \\( q \\) is 4 W. The options provided for the surface temperature are:\n\nA. 340.93 K  \nB. 350.93 K  \nC. 360.93 K  \n\nTo solve this problem, one would need to use the appropriate heat conduction equation for a hemispherical heat source embedded in a semi-infinite medium with specified boundary conditions. The solution involves calculating the temperature rise due to the heat generation and adding it to the ambient temperature."
