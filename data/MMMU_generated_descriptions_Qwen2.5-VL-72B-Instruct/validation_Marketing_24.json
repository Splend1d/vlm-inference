    "description": "The image displays a table titled \"Table 2.71,\" which presents data from a survey conducted among six hundred adult Americans regarding their perception of what constitutes a middle-class income. The table consists of two columns: \"Salary ($)\" and \"Relative frequency.\"\n\nThe \"Salary ($)\" column lists various income ranges with the following intervals:\n- Less than $20,000\n- $20,000\u2013$25,000\n- $25,000\u2013$30,000\n- $30,000\u2013$40,000\n- $40,000\u2013$50,000\n- $50,000\u2013$75,000\n- $75,000\u2013$99,999\n- $100,000+\n\nThe \"Relative frequency\" column provides the corresponding relative frequencies for each salary range:\n- For salaries less than $20,000: 0.02\n- For salaries between $20,000 and $25,000: 0.09\n- For salaries between $25,000 and $30,000: 0.19\n- For salaries between $30,000 and $40,000: 0.26\n- For salaries between $40,000 and $50,000: 0.18\n- For salaries between $50,000 and $75,000: 0.17\n- For salaries between $75,000 and $99,999: 0.02\n- For salaries $100,000 and above: 0.01\n\nThe sum of all relative frequencies listed in the table is 0.94. Since the total relative frequency should equal 1, the remaining 0.06 represents those who answered \"not sure.\" Therefore, the percentage of the survey respondents who answered \"not sure\" is 0.06."
