    "question": "A 61-year-old woman comes to her physician because of a change in the appearance of her right breast over the past 7 months. On physical examination the skin overlying the breast is indurated, roughened, and reddish-orange. There is nipple retraction. The gross appearance of the cut surface of her subsequent mastectomy specimen is shown here. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? <image 1> ",
    "options": "['Infiltrating ductal carcinoma', 'Intraductal carcinoma', 'Phyllodes tumor', 'Lobular carcinoma in situ']",

    "description": "The image shows a gross pathological specimen from a mastectomy. The cut surface of the tissue reveals an extensive, diffuse infiltration with a gelatinous or mucoid appearance. The affected area appears to have a soft, translucent quality with a slightly raised, irregular surface. The coloration is predominantly pale yellowish-white with some areas showing a pinkish hue. There are no distinct nodules or well-defined masses visible; instead, the infiltration seems to spread diffusely throughout the tissue. The surrounding tissue appears more normal in texture and color, providing a contrast to the affected area. The overall appearance suggests a neoplastic process that has infiltrated the breast tissue in a widespread manner, consistent with certain types of breast cancer. \n\nGiven the clinical presentation described (indurated, roughened, reddish-orange skin, nipple retraction) and the gross appearance of the mastectomy specimen, the most likely diagnosis is:\n\nA. Infiltrating ductal carcinoma\n\nThis type of cancer typically presents with diffuse infiltration and can cause changes in the overlying skin, such as those described in the patient's case. The other options listed (intraductal carcinoma, phyllodes tumor, lobular carcinoma in situ) do not typically present with this gross appearance and clinical features."
