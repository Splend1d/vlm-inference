    "description": "The image is a table labeled \"Table 11.47,\" which presents data on the relationship between the age groups of the youngest online entrepreneurs and their net worth values. The table has four columns and three rows (excluding the header row). Here's a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Columns:\n1. **Age group**: This column lists two age ranges for the entrepreneurs: \n   - 17\u201325 years old.\n   - 26\u201330 years old.\n2. **Net worth value (in millions of US dollars)**: This column is divided into three sub-columns representing different net worth ranges:\n   - 1\u20135 million dollars.\n   - 6\u201324 million dollars.\n   - \u226525 million dollars.\n3. **Row total**: This column shows the total number of entrepreneurs in each age group across all net worth categories.\n\n### Rows:\n- The first row corresponds to the age group 17\u201325:\n  - 8 entrepreneurs have a net worth of 1\u20135 million dollars.\n  - 7 entrepreneurs have a net worth of 6\u201324 million dollars.\n  - 5 entrepreneurs have a net worth of \u226525 million dollars.\n  - The row total is 20 entrepreneurs.\n  \n- The second row corresponds to the age group 26\u201330:\n  - 6 entrepreneurs have a net worth of 1\u20135 million dollars.\n  - 5 entrepreneurs have a net worth of 6\u201324 million dollars.\n  - 9 entrepreneurs have a net worth of \u226525 million dollars.\n  - The row total is 20 entrepreneurs.\n\n### Column totals:\n- The column total for the net worth of 1\u20135 million dollars is 14 entrepreneurs.\n- The column total for the net worth of 6\u201324 million dollars is 12 entrepreneurs.\n- The column total for the net worth of \u226525 million dollars is 14 entrepreneurs.\n- The grand total (sum of all cells) is 40 entrepreneurs.\n\nThis table is used to determine if there is an association between the age groups and the net worth values using a chi-square ($\\chi^2$) test. The question asks for the calculated $\\chi^2$ test statistic value."
