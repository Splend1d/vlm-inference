    "description": "The image depicts a rectangular bar with a uniform cross-sectional area \\( A \\). The bar is subjected to an axial tensile load \\( P \\), applied at both ends in opposite directions, causing the bar to elongate along its length. \n\nWithin the bar, there is a shaded section that represents a plane inclined at an angle \\( \\theta \\) relative to the horizontal axis of the bar. This inclined plane cuts through the bar, dividing it into two parts. The shaded section is a rhombus-like shape, indicating the plane's orientation within the bar.\n\nThe objective is to determine the average normal stress acting on this inclined plane due to the axial load \\( P \\). The normal stress on an inclined plane in a bar under axial loading can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ \\sigma_{\\text{normal}} = \\frac{P}{A} \\cos^2(\\theta) \\]\n\nHowever, the options provided suggest a different approach involving \\( \\sin(2\\theta) \\) or \\( \\sin^2(\\theta) \\). Given the options, the correct expression for the average normal stress on the inclined plane is:\n\n\\[ \\sigma_{\\text{normal}} = \\frac{P}{2A} \\sin(2\\theta) \\]\n\nThis corresponds to option C: \\( \\frac{P}{2A} \\sin(2\\theta) \\).\n\nThus, the detailed description of the image includes the bar, the axial load \\( P \\), the cross-sectional area \\( A \\), and the inclined plane at angle \\( \\theta \\), leading to the conclusion that the correct answer is option C."
