    "question": "A 32-year-old woman has the acute onset of fever, cough, and dyspnea as she is preparing to leave her work and go home. When she gets home the symptoms have abated. This scenario is repeated on multiple occasions over the next 6 weeks. On physical examination she has no abnormal findings. A transbronchial biopsy is performed after she is hospitalized with respiratory distress. The microscopic appearance of the biopsy is shown here. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? <image 1> ",
    "options": "['Influenza viral pneumonia', 'Hypersensitivity pneumonitis', 'Diffuse alveolar damage', 'Miliary tuberculosis']",
    "id": "validation_Clinical_Medicine_17",
    "description": "The image shows a histological section of lung tissue stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). The tissue exhibits a pattern characterized by the presence of numerous small, well-defined granulomas scattered throughout the lung parenchyma. These granulomas consist of tightly packed clusters of inflammatory cells, predominantly lymphocytes and macrophages, with occasional multinucleated giant cells. The surrounding lung tissue appears relatively preserved, with minimal fibrosis or necrosis. There is no evidence of viral inclusions, extensive alveolar damage, or caseating granulomas typical of tuberculosis. The overall appearance suggests a chronic inflammatory process with a focus on immune-mediated reactions rather than an acute infectious or necrotic process. \n\nGiven this description, the most likely diagnosis among the provided options is B. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis, which is characterized by the formation of non-caseating granulomas in response to repeated inhalation of organic dusts or antigens. The clinical presentation of intermittent symptoms correlating with exposure further supports this diagnosis."
