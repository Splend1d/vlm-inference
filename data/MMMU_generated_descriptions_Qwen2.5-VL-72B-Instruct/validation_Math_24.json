    "description": "The image depicts a right circular cone with a radius \\( R \\) at its base and a height \\( H \\). Inside this cone, there is an inscribed right circular cylinder. The cylinder has a radius \\( r \\) and a height \\( h \\). The cylinder's top surface is parallel to the base of the cone, and it touches the cone's lateral surface at the edges of its top circle. The height \\( H \\) of the cone extends from the apex of the cone to the center of the base of the cone. The radius \\( R \\) of the cone's base is measured from the center of the base to the edge of the base. The cylinder's height \\( h \\) is measured from the plane of the cylinder's bottom circle to the plane of the cylinder's top circle. The cylinder's radius \\( r \\) is measured from the center of the cylinder's top or bottom circle to the edge of the circle. The cylinder is positioned such that its axis coincides with the axis of the cone. The goal is to find the dimensions of the cylinder that maximize its volume while being inscribed within the given cone."
