    "question": "<image 1> The diagram above represents the idealized titration curve for the reaction of sodium oxalate ($Na_2C_2O_4$) with a strong acid like hydrochloric acid ($HCl$). E and F represent the pH at the endpoints. G and H will depend on the composition of the sample with the possibility that one may not be present.

    "description": "The image provided is a titration curve graph depicting the change in pH as a function of the volume of a strong acid added during the titration of sodium oxalate (Na\u2082C\u2082O\u2084) with hydrochloric acid (HCl). The x-axis represents the \"Volume strong acid added,\" while the y-axis represents the \"pH.\" \n\nKey points on the graph include:\n\n- **E**: This point is located on the upper plateau of the curve before the first sharp drop in pH. It indicates the pH at which the initial buffering capacity of the solution is still intact.\n  \n- **F**: This point is located on the lower plateau after the second sharp drop in pH. It represents the final pH after the complete reaction has occurred.\n\n- **G**: This point marks the beginning of the first sharp decrease in pH, indicating the first equivalence point where the first protonation step occurs.\n\n- **H**: This point marks the beginning of the second sharp decrease in pH, indicating the second equivalence point where the second protonation step occurs.\n\nAt point **E**, the solution is still predominantly basic due to the presence of sodium oxalate (Na\u2082C\u2082O\u2084), which dissociates into Na\u207a ions and C\u2082O\u2084\u00b2\u207b ions. As the strong acid (HCl) is added, it reacts with the C\u2082O\u2084\u00b2\u207b ions to form HC\u2082O\u2084\u207b ions. However, at point E, the amount of added acid is not sufficient to completely protonate all C\u2082O\u2084\u00b2\u207b ions, so both C\u2082O\u2084\u00b2\u207b and HC\u2082O\u2084\u207b ions coexist in the solution along with Na\u207a and Cl\u207b ions from the dissociation of Na\u2082C\u2082O\u2084 and HCl, respectively.\n\nTherefore, the predominant species in solution at point E are Na\u207a, Cl\u207b, and HC\u2082O\u2084\u207b."
