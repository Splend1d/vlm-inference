    "description": "The image displays a table with three columns and four rows (excluding the header row). The columns are labeled \"Perpetuity,\" \"Annual amount,\" and \"Discount rate.\" Each row corresponds to a different perpetuity labeled A, B, C, and D.\n\nHere's the detailed breakdown:\n\n- **Row A:**  \n  - Perpetuity: A  \n  - Annual amount: $20,000  \n  - Discount rate: 8%  \n\n- **Row B:**  \n  - Perpetuity: B  \n  - Annual amount: $100,000  \n  - Discount rate: 10%  \n\n- **Row C:**  \n  - Perpetuity: C  \n  - Annual amount: $3,000  \n  - Discount rate: 6%  \n\n- **Row D:**  \n  - Perpetuity: D  \n  - Annual amount: $60,000  \n  - Discount rate: 5%  \n\nThis table provides the necessary information to calculate the present value of each perpetuity using the formula \\( \\text{Present Value} = \\frac{\\text{Annual Amount}}{\\text{Discount Rate}} \\). For example, for Perpetuity C, the annual amount is $3,000 and the discount rate is 6%."
