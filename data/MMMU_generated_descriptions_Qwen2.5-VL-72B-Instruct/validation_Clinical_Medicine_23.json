    "question": "Which organ(s) are abnormally large in this abdominal radiograph? <image 1> ",

    "description": "This is an abdominal radiograph showing the bony structures, including the spine and pelvis, as well as the soft tissues and gas patterns within the abdomen. The spine appears normal in alignment and there are no obvious abnormalities in its structure. The liver, which is located in the upper right quadrant of the abdomen, does not appear to be enlarged; its size seems consistent with normal limits. The kidneys are not clearly visible in this image, likely due to overlying bowel gas and soft tissue shadows, so their size cannot be accurately assessed. However, the small intestines are prominently visible and appear to be significantly distended with gas, indicating they are abnormally large. There is a considerable amount of gas throughout the small intestines, which is not typical for a normal abdomen. This suggests that the small intestines are the organ that is abnormally large in this radiograph. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Small Intestines."
