    "question": "The pedigree in <image 1> shows the mode of inheritance of a human disease that is associated with mutations in Gene A. Note: Individuals marrying into this family DO NOT have the disease-associated allele unless shaded and the pedigree is completely penetrant. What is the genotype(s) of Individual 9?",

    "description": "The image is a pedigree chart representing the inheritance pattern of a genetic trait within a family. The chart uses standard symbols: circles represent females, squares represent males, and shaded symbols indicate individuals affected by the trait. Lines connecting the symbols represent family relationships, with horizontal lines indicating marriages and vertical lines indicating parent-child relationships.\n\nHere's a detailed breakdown of the pedigree:\n\n- **Generation 1:** \n  - Individual 1 (female, unaffected) and Individual 2 (male, unaffected) are the grandparents.\n  \n- **Generation 2:** \n  - Individual 3 (male, affected) and Individual 4 (female, unaffected) are parents of one branch.\n  - Individual 5 (female, unaffected), Individual 6 (male, unaffected), and Individual 7 (male, affected) are siblings from another branch. Individual 7 is married to Individual 8 (female, unaffected).\n\n- **Generation 3:** \n  - From the branch of Individual 3 and Individual 4:\n    - Individual 9 (female, unaffected)\n    - Individual 10 (male, unaffected)\n    - Individual 11 (male, affected)\n    - Individual 12 (female, affected)\n  - From the branch of Individual 7 and Individual 8:\n    - Individual 13 (male, unaffected)\n    - Individual 14 (male, unaffected)\n    - Individual 15 (female, unaffected) is married to Individual 16 (male, unaffected).\n\n- **Generation 4:** \n  - From the marriage of Individual 15 and Individual 16:\n    - Individual 17 (male, unaffected)\n    - Individual 18 (male, affected)\n    - Individual 19 (female, unaffected)\n\nBased on the pedigree, the trait appears to follow an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance because:\n- Affected individuals have at least one affected parent.\n- Both males and females can be affected.\n- There are no instances where two unaffected parents have an affected child, which would suggest a recessive pattern.\n\nGiven this information, the genotype of Individual 9, who is unaffected, must be \"aa\" if the trait were recessive, but since it is dominant, she must be \"Aa\" (heterozygous) because she has an affected parent (Individual 3). Therefore, the correct answer is B. Aa."
