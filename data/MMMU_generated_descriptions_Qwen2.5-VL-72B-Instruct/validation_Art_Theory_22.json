At the center of the cover is a depiction of Christ crucified, surrounded by four angelic figures in each corner. The central figure of Christ is flanked by two heart symbols above his head, and the Latin inscription \"HIC EST REX IVDEORVM\" (Here is the King of the Jews) is inscribed below the hearts. The entire surface is embellished with a grid of colorful gemstones, including red, blue, green, and white stones, set into a gold background. The edges of the cover are framed with a dense border of smaller gemstones and decorative motifs. The overall craftsmanship suggests that this object was created for a significant religious or ceremonial purpose, likely to house a sacred text. \n\nBased on the description, the work functioned as:\n\nB. a book cover"
