    "description": "The image depicts a vessel with an internal coiled structure. The vessel has a cylindrical shape with rounded ends. Inside the vessel, there is a tightly wound coil that runs from one end to the other. There are two sets of labeled arrows indicating flow directions: \"IN\" and \"OUT.\" One set of \"IN\" and \"OUT\" labels points to connections at the top and bottom of the vessel, suggesting the flow of a fluid through the main body of the vessel. Another set of \"IN\" and \"OUT\" labels points to connections on the side of the vessel, indicating the flow of another fluid through the internal coil. The coil is positioned within the vessel, allowing for heat exchange between the two fluids. The overall design suggests that this is a type of heat exchanger where the internal coil facilitates the transfer of heat between the two fluids. \n\nBased on this description, the diagram represents a **C. Internal Coiled Vessel**."
