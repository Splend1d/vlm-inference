    "description": "The image depicts a reclining couple on a kline (a type of couch), which is characteristic of Etruscan funerary art. The figures are sculpted in terracotta and exhibit a serene, almost smiling expression. The woman is seated upright, holding a drinking vessel, while the man lies behind her with his arm around her. Both figures are adorned with detailed clothing and hairstyles typical of Etruscan depictions. The kline they rest on is intricately carved with decorative elements. The overall style and composition suggest this artifact is from the Etruscan culture."
