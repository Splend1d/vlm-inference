    "question": "<image 1> Which of the following does the offspring of a pod bug resemble?",
    "options": "['Similar to the adult, but shorter and without wings', 'Grub', 'Maggot', 'Caterpillar', \"Don't know and don't want to guess\"]",
    "id": "validation_Agriculture_14",
    "description": "The image shows a close-up of an adult pod bug resting on a green leaf. The pod bug has a slender, elongated body with a light brown or tan coloration. Its body is somewhat flat and narrow, tapering towards the rear. The insect has long, thin legs that are spread out, allowing it to grip the leaf securely. It also has two pairs of wings; the front wings are partially folded over its back, while the hind wings are not visible in this view. The pod bug's head is small with two prominent antennae extending forward. The overall appearance of the pod bug suggests that it belongs to the order Hemiptera, which includes true bugs known for their incomplete metamorphosis.\n\nGiven this description, the offspring of a pod bug would most likely resemble option A: \"Similar to the adult, but shorter and without wings.\" This is because insects with incomplete metamorphosis typically hatch as nymphs that look like smaller versions of the adults, lacking fully developed wings until they mature through a series of molts."
