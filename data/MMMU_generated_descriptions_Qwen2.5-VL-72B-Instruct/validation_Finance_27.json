    "question": "A recent study of inflationary expectations has revealed that the consensus among economic forecasters yields the following average annual rates of inflation expected over the periods noted. (Note: Assume that the risk that future interest rate movements will affect longer maturities more than shorter maturities is zero; that is, assume that there is no maturity risk.) <image 1> If the real rate of interest is currently 2.5%, find the nominal rate of interest on the following U.S. Treasury issues: 5-year bond",

    "description": "The image presents a table with two columns: \"Period\" and \"Average annual rate of inflation.\" The table lists various time periods along with their corresponding average annual rates of inflation:\n\n- For a period of **3 months**, the average annual rate of inflation is **5%**.\n- For a period of **2 years**, the average annual rate of inflation is **6%**.\n- For a period of **5 years**, the average annual rate of inflation is **8%**.\n- For a period of **10 years**, the average annual rate of inflation is **8.5%**.\n- For a period of **20 years**, the average annual rate of inflation is **9%**.\n\nThis information is relevant for calculating the nominal rate of interest on a U.S. Treasury issue, given the real rate of interest and the expected inflation rate over the specified period."
