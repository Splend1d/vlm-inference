    "question": "Researchers have long studied human memory. In a classic series of studies, the German psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus investigated the storage and recall of information in memory. Based on his findings, he developed the so-called forgetting curve, a way of illustrating the rate at which people forget the information they have learned. The forgetting curve has been studied in a variety of different environments and for a variety of different stimuli. On day 1 of the memory research study, participants were asked to learn a list of items. Researchers then tracked the proportion of the list that the participants remembered as time passed. On day 2, some participants were asked to relearn the list. Again, the proportion remembered was tracked over time. On day 3, some participants were asked to relearn the list a second time, and the proportion they remembered was tracked over time. On day 4, some participants were asked to relearn the list a third time, and the proportion they remembered was tracked over time. The data from this study produced the following set of forgetting curves. Each line represents the memory of the learned or relearned list. The proportion of the list remembered is shown on the y-axis (memory), and the time interval for forgetting is shown on the x-axis (time remembered in days). <image 1> Based on the graph, which of the following statements BEST characterizes forgetting?",
    "options": "['Most forgetting occurs gradually over a long period of time.', 'Most forgetting occurs after only a few days.', 'Most forgetting occurs soon after information is learned.', 'Most forgetting occurs at a constant rate over time.']",

    "description": "The image is a graph depicting the forgetting curve across multiple reviews of learned material. The x-axis represents \"Time remembered (days),\" ranging from 0 to 6 days. The y-axis represents \"Memory,\" indicating the proportion of the learned material retained over time. There are four distinct lines on the graph, each representing a different stage of learning and review:\n\n1. **First learning exposure**: This line starts at the highest point on the y-axis (indicating full memory retention) and shows a steep decline initially. Within the first day, there is a significant drop in memory retention. Afterward, the decline becomes more gradual, but it continues to decrease steadily until day 6.\n\n2. **Second review**: This line also begins at the top of the y-axis but shows less steep initial forgetting compared to the first learning exposure. The memory retention declines more slowly than the first exposure, especially after the initial few days.\n\n3. **Third review**: Similar to the previous lines, this one starts at the top of the y-axis. However, the rate of forgetting is even slower compared to the second review. The memory retention remains higher for a longer period, with a more gradual decline over the six days.\n\n4. **Fourth review**: This line again starts at the top of the y-axis. It shows the slowest rate of forgetting among all the lines. Memory retention is maintained at a relatively high level throughout the six days, with only a slight decline observed.\n\nEach subsequent review results in a flatter curve, indicating that repeated reviews help in retaining the information for a longer duration. The graph clearly illustrates that most forgetting occurs soon after the information is initially learned, as seen by the steep initial decline in the \"First learning exposure\" line. Subsequent reviews mitigate this rapid forgetting, leading to a more gradual decline in memory retention over time."
