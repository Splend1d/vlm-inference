    "description": "**Image 1 Description:**\nThe first image shows a dark-colored sculpture of a seated figure. The figure appears to be male, with a calm facial expression and a flat-topped headpiece. The figure is depicted in a seated position, holding what seems to be a staff or scepter in one hand and resting the other hand on its knee. The figure's attire includes a loincloth and arm bands, suggesting traditional clothing. The sculpture has a polished finish and intricate details, indicating it may hold cultural or ceremonial significance.\n\n**Image 2 Description:**\nThe second image depicts a ceremonial scene where a person is seated on an ornate throne, surrounded by people. The seated individual is dressed in elaborate traditional attire, including a patterned robe and a headdress adorned with feathers and other decorative elements. The person holds a staff or scepter, symbolizing authority or leadership. The throne is decorated with intricate patterns and is accompanied by large ceremonial drums. The surrounding individuals appear to be observing the scene, some sitting and others standing, all dressed in traditional clothing. The setting suggests a cultural or ritualistic event taking place outdoors, possibly in a village or community gathering area.\n\nBased on these descriptions, the Ndop sculptures, as represented in Image 1, seem to depict figures of authority or importance, similar to the individual in Image 2 who is seated on a throne and holding a scepter. The presence of a contemporary ceremonial scene in Image 2 suggests that the traditions associated with Ndop sculptures are still active today, even though the specific style of the sculpture might have evolved over time. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is:\n\n**B. is still active today**"
