    "description": "The image depicts a mechanical system involving a bell crank mechanism. The key components and dimensions are as follows:\n\n- A vertical force \\( P = 1500 \\) N is applied downward at point \\( A \\).\n- Point \\( A \\) is located 450 mm horizontally from point \\( B \\), where the pin is located.\n- Point \\( B \\) is the center of a pin with a diameter of 6 mm, which is subjected to double shear.\n- Point \\( C \\) is connected to point \\( D \\) via a horizontal link, and point \\( C \\) is 300 mm vertically above point \\( B \\).\n- The angle between the link \\( BC \\) and the horizontal is 45 degrees.\n\nThe goal is to determine the average shear stress developed in the 6-mm diameter pin \\( B \\) due to the applied force \\( P \\). The pin is subjected to double shear, meaning it will experience shear forces on both sides of the pin.\n\nTo solve this problem, you would need to calculate the moment about point \\( B \\) caused by the force \\( P \\), determine the shear force acting on the pin, and then use the formula for shear stress in a circular cross-section under double shear. The options provided for the average shear stress are:\nA. 60.5 MPa\nB. 62.2 MPa\nC. 40.5 MPa\nD. 40.2 MPa"
