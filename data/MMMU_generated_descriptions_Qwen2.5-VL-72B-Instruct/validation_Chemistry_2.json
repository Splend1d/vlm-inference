    "options": "['The Lewis structure shows ten valence electrons which is not the correct number.', 'The Lewis structure shows the electrons as distributed evenly between the carbon and oxygen but they are not.', 'The Lewis structure should show the intermolecular forces present, but it does not.', 'The Lewis structure shows the bond between carbon and oxygen as a triple bond but the real bond is actually a double bond.', 'The Lewis structure shows that the molecule has a linear shape but it is actually a bent/v-shape substance.']",

    "description": "The image displays the Lewis structure for the carbon monoxide (CO) molecule. In this structure:\n\n- Carbon (C) is represented by its symbol \"C,\" and Oxygen (O) is represented by its symbol \"O.\"\n- There is a triple bond between the carbon and oxygen atoms, indicated by three parallel lines connecting the symbols C and O.\n- Each atom also has lone pairs of electrons depicted as dots. Specifically:\n  - The carbon atom has one lone pair of electrons (two dots).\n  - The oxygen atom has two lone pairs of electrons (four dots).\n\nThis representation indicates that the molecule has a total of ten valence electrons: six from oxygen and four from carbon, all accounted for in the structure with the triple bond and lone pairs. The structure suggests an even distribution of electrons between the carbon and oxygen atoms, forming a linear arrangement due to the presence of the triple bond and lone pairs. \n\nThe Lewis structure does not depict intermolecular forces or the exact bond type beyond single, double, or triple bonds. It also does not provide information about molecular geometry beyond the basic connectivity and electron distribution around each atom."
