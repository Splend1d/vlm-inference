    "description": "The image depicts a mechanical setup involving a block, a cylinder, and a spring. The block is shown at the top of the cylinder, which is filled with a fluid (likely water). The block is labeled and appears to be in motion, dropping vertically downward into the cylinder. The cylinder is transparent, allowing the internal components to be visible. At the bottom of the cylinder, there is a spring with a spring constant denoted by \"k.\" The spring is compressed when the block impacts it. The height from which the block drops is labeled as \"h,\" indicating the distance between the initial position of the block and the point where it starts compressing the spring. The spring's stiffness is given as \\( k = 90 \\) N/m, and the weight of the block is \\( W = 5.0 \\) N. The height \\( h \\) is specified as \\( 200 \\) mm. The problem requires determining the maximum shortening of the spring due to the impact of the block. The options provided for the maximum shortening are A. 114.64 mm, B. 214.64 mm, and C. 314.64 mm."
