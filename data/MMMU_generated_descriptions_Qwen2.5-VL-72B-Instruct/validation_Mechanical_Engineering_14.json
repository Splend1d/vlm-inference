    "question": "Figure shows a 1000-kg mass being lowered by a cable at a uniform rate of 4 m/s from a drum of 550-mm-diameter weighing 2.5 kN and having a 250-mm-radius of gyration.(a) What is the kinetic energy in the system?(b) The uniform rate of descent is maintained by a brake on the drum which applies a torque of 2698 N\u22c5m. What additional brake torque is required to bring the system to rest in 0.60 s?<image 1>",

    "description": "The image depicts a mechanical system involving a 1000 kg mass being lowered by a cable at a constant speed of 4 meters per second. The cable is wound around a drum with a diameter of 550 mm (or 0.55 meters). The drum itself weighs 2.5 kilonewtons (kN), and it has a radius of gyration of 250 mm (or 0.25 meters).\n\nThe setup includes a brake mechanism applied to the drum, which exerts a torque of 2698 newton-meters (N\u00b7m) to maintain the uniform rate of descent of the mass. The question asks for two calculations:\n\n(a) The kinetic energy present in the entire system.\n(b) The additional brake torque needed to bring the system to a complete stop within 0.60 seconds.\n\nThe options provided for the answers are:\nA. 9673 Joules (J), 2218 N\u00b7m  \nB. 5723 J, 1218 N\u00b7m  \nC. 9673 J, 1218 N\u00b7m  \nD. 5723 J, 2218 N\u00b7m  \n\nThe image visually represents the described components: the 1000 kg mass, the drum with its dimensions and weight, and the cable connecting them. The downward arrow indicates the direction of motion of the mass. The drum is shown with a plus sign inside, likely indicating the point where the torque is applied or measured."
