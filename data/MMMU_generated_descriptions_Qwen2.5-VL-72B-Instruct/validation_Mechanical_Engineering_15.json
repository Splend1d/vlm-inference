    "description": "The image consists of two geometric shapes placed side by side at the top. The shape on the left is a parallelogram divided into two smaller parallelograms by a horizontal line. The shape on the right is an L-shaped figure composed of two squares joined at one corner.\n\nBelow these two shapes, there are four options labeled (a), (b), (c), and (d). Each option represents a potential left view of the combined shapes:\n\n- Option (a) shows a rectangle divided into three sections: a small square in the upper left corner, a larger rectangle below it, and another rectangle to the right.\n- Option (b) shows a similar layout to (a) but with the small square in the upper left corner replaced by an L-shaped figure.\n- Option (c) shows a rectangle with a smaller rectangle inside it, positioned towards the bottom right.\n- Option (d) shows a rectangle divided into three sections: a small square in the upper left corner, a larger rectangle below it, and another rectangle to the right, similar to (a) but with a different internal division.\n\nThe correct left view should match the combined shapes when viewed from the left side. Based on the shapes provided, the correct option is (b), as it correctly represents the L-shaped figure and the division of the parallelogram when viewed from the left."
