    "description": "The image displays two bar graphs labeled (a) and (b), both titled \"Figure 2.25.\" Each graph has five bars corresponding to values on the x-axis labeled 1 through 5. The y-axis represents frequency but lacks numerical labels.\n\n### Graph (a):\n- Bar 1: Shortest bar, indicating the lowest frequency.\n- Bar 2: Slightly taller than Bar 1.\n- Bar 3: Tallest bar in this graph, indicating the highest frequency.\n- Bar 4: Shorter than Bar 3 but taller than Bars 1 and 2.\n- Bar 5: Similar height to Bar 4.\n\n### Graph (b):\n- Bar 1: Taller than Bar 1 in Graph (a).\n- Bar 2: Slightly shorter than Bar 1 in this graph.\n- Bar 3: Shorter than Bars 1 and 2 in this graph.\n- Bar 4: Similar height to Bar 3.\n- Bar 5: Tallest bar in this graph, significantly taller than all other bars.\n\nBoth graphs lack specific numerical values on the y-axis, making it impossible to determine precise frequencies or calculate quartiles accurately. The visual comparison suggests differences in distribution, but without exact values, we cannot definitively compare the third quartiles of the two distributions."
