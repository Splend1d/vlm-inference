    "question": "A 49-year-old man has had marked chest pain for the last 4 hours. An EKG shows ST segment elevation. Laboratory studies show cardiac troponin of 10 ng/mL. The representative gross appearance of his disease process is depicted here. Which of the following findings is most likely to occur in this man? <image 1> ",
    "options": "['Liquefactive necrosis', 'Caseous necrosis', 'Coagulative necrosis', 'Wet gangrene']",

    "description": "The image depicts a human heart with a grossly visible area of tissue damage. The affected region appears firm and has a pale, yellowish-tan coloration compared to the surrounding healthy myocardium, which retains its normal reddish-brown hue. The demarcation between the damaged and healthy tissue is relatively sharp. There is no evidence of liquefaction or softening of the tissue, nor is there any purulent exudate or signs of infection that would suggest gangrene. The texture of the damaged area seems consistent with coagulation, where the cellular structure is preserved but the cells are dead. The overall appearance is characteristic of an infarcted area, likely due to a blockage in the coronary arteries leading to ischemia and subsequent cell death. \n\nBased on this description, the most likely finding in the man described in the question is **C. Coagulative necrosis**. This type of necrosis is characterized by the preservation of the basic tissue architecture while the cells die, which matches the described appearance of the heart in the image."
