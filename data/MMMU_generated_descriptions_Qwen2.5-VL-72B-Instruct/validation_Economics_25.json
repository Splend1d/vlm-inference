    "question": "Suppose that the price of basketball tickets at your college is determined by market forces. Currently, the demand and supply schedules are as follows: <image 1> Your college plans to increase total enrollment next year by 5,000 students. The additional students will have the following demand schedule: <image 2> Now add the old demand schedule and the demand schedule for the new students to calculate the new demand schedule for the entire college. What will be the new equilibrium quantity?",

    "description": "The first table shows the current demand and supply schedules for basketball tickets at a college:\n\n| Price ($) | Quantity Demanded (tickets) | Quantity Supplied (tickets) |\n|-----------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| 4         | 10,000                      | 8,000                       |\n| 8         | 8,000                       | 8,000                       |\n| 12        | 6,000                       | 8,000                       |\n| 16        | 4,000                       | 8,000                       |\n| 20        | 2,000                       | 8,000                       |\n\nThe second table shows the demand schedule for the additional 5,000 students:\n\n| Price ($) | Quantity Demanded (tickets) |\n|-----------|-----------------------------|\n| 4         | 4,000                       |\n| 8         | 3,000                       |\n| 12        | 2,000                       |\n| 16        | 1,000                       |\n| 20        | 0                           |\n\nTo find the new equilibrium quantity after adding the demand from the new students, you need to combine the old demand schedule with the new one. For example, at a price of $8, the old demand was 8,000 tickets, and the new demand is 3,000 tickets, so the combined demand would be 11,000 tickets. \n\nBy comparing this new combined demand schedule with the supply schedule, you can determine the new equilibrium quantity where the combined demand equals the supply. In this case, the new equilibrium quantity is 8,000 tickets."
