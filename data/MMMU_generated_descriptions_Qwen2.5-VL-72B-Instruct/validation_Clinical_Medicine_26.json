    "description": "The image shows two X-ray views of a wrist: an anteroposterior (AP) view and a lateral view. The AP view displays the bones of the hand and wrist from the front, while the lateral view shows them from the side. In both views, there is a clear fracture visible at the base of the fifth metacarpal bone, which is located near the outer edge of the hand. This fracture appears to be transverse and involves the metacarpal neck region. There is no significant displacement or angulation observed in the fractured fragments. The surrounding soft tissues appear swollen, indicating inflammation due to the injury. The other bones in the wrist and hand, including the carpal bones and the radius and ulna, do not show any obvious fractures or abnormalities. \n\nGiven the location and characteristics of the fracture described, it is consistent with a Jones fracture."
