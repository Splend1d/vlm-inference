    "question": "Solid sodium borohydride (NaBH4) is being studied as a possible source of hydrogen fuel for hydrogen-powered vehicles. The borohydride reacts with water to produce hydrogen gas and sodium metaborate. Identify which atoms of the reactants are oxidized, which atoms are reduced,<image 1>",
    "options": "['H,O', 'H,Na', 'H,B', 'H,H']",

    "description": "The image shows a chemical equation representing the reaction between solid sodium borohydride (NaBH\u2084) and liquid water (H\u2082O). The products of this reaction are gaseous hydrogen (H\u2082) and aqueous sodium metaborate (NaBO\u2082). The equation is balanced and written as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{NaBH}_4(\\text{s}) + 2\\text{H}_2\\text{O}(\\text{l}) \\longrightarrow 4\\text{H}_2(\\text{g}) + \\text{NaBO}_2(\\text{aq}) \\]\n\nIn this reaction:\n- Sodium borohydride (NaBH\u2084) is in its solid state.\n- Water (H\u2082O) is in its liquid state.\n- Hydrogen gas (H\u2082) is produced in its gaseous state.\n- Sodium metaborate (NaBO\u2082) is formed in an aqueous solution.\n\nTo determine which atoms are oxidized and which are reduced, one needs to consider the changes in oxidation states of the elements involved in the reaction. Specifically, the hydrogen atoms in NaBH\u2084 and H\u2082O undergo changes in their oxidation states during the reaction. The correct choice among the given options will reflect these changes accurately."
