    "question": "There are three predominant theories that attempt to explain how the components of emotion-the physiological, the behavioral, and the cognitive-are interconnected. What is name of the theory as shown in the figure below? <image 1>",
    "options": "['James-Lange Theory', 'Cannon-Bard Theory', 'Schachter-Singer Theory', 'Cranberry-Melon Theory']",

    "description": "The image is a flowchart illustrating the process of emotional response. It consists of five rectangular boxes connected by arrows indicating the sequence of events. \n\n1. The first box, labeled \"Emotional-Inducing Stimulus,\" is colored pink. This box has two arrows pointing from it to two other boxes.\n2. The second box, labeled \"Physiological Response,\" is colored dark blue. An arrow points from the \"Emotional-Inducing Stimulus\" box to this one.\n3. The third box, labeled \"Conscious Cognitive Interpretation,\" is colored purple. Another arrow points from the \"Emotional-Inducing Stimulus\" box to this one.\n4. Both the \"Physiological Response\" and \"Conscious Cognitive Interpretation\" boxes have arrows pointing to a fourth box, which is labeled \"Behavioral Response\" and is colored green.\n5. Finally, an arrow points from the \"Behavioral Response\" box to a fifth box, labeled \"Labeling of Emotion,\" which is colored teal.\n\nThis flowchart suggests that an emotional-inducing stimulus leads simultaneously to both a physiological response and a conscious cognitive interpretation. These two processes then contribute to a behavioral response, which ultimately results in the labeling of the emotion. This sequence aligns with the Schachter-Singer Theory, which posits that emotions arise from a combination of physiological arousal and cognitive interpretation of that arousal. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Schachter-Singer Theory."
