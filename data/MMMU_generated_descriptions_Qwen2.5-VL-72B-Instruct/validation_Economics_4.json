    "description": "The image displays a graph with two axes: the vertical axis represents the \"Inflation Rate (%),\" and the horizontal axis represents the \"Unemployment Rate (%).\" A smooth, downward-sloping curve connects these two variables. As the unemployment rate increases along the horizontal axis, the inflation rate decreases along the vertical axis. This inverse relationship between inflation and unemployment is depicted by the curve's downward slope. There are no other elements or labels present in the graph."
