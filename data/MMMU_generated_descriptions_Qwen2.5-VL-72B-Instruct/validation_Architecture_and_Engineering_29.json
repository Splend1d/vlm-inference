    "description": "The image presents a table summarizing observations made using a tacheometer equipped with an anallactic lens. The table includes the following columns:\n\n- **Instrument station**: Indicates the location where the instrument was set up for measurements. In this case, it is labeled as \"R.\"\n- **Staff station**: Represents the points where the staff readings were taken. Two stations are listed: \"P\" and \"Q.\"\n- **Bearing**: Provides the horizontal angle measured clockwise from the reference direction (typically North) to the line connecting the instrument station to the staff station. For station P, the bearing is 130\u00b0, and for station Q, it is 220\u00b0.\n- **Vertical angle**: Specifies the angle between the horizontal plane and the line of sight from the instrument to the staff. For station P, the vertical angle is +10\u00b032', and for station Q, it is +5\u00b006'.\n- **Staff readings (m)**: Lists three staff readings taken at each station. For station P, the readings are 1.255 m, 1.810 m, and 2.365 m. For station Q, the readings are 1.300 m, 2.120 m, and 2.940 m.\n\nAdditional information provided outside the table:\n- The constants of the instrument are given as 100 and 0.\n- The staff was held vertically during the measurements.\n\nThis data is essential for calculating the gradient between points P and Q using tacheometric principles."
