    "question": "A particle continuously moves in a circular path at constant speed in a counterclockwise direction. Consider a time interval during which the particle moves along this circular path from point P to point Q. Point Q is exactly half-way around the circle from Point P.<image 1>What is the direction of the average velocity during this time interval?",
    "options": "['rightward', 'leftward', 'upward', 'The average velocity is zero.']",
    "id": "validation_Physics_16",
    "description": "The image depicts a circular path with two labeled points: P and Q. Point P is located on the right side of the circle, while point Q is directly opposite it on the left side. This means that point Q is exactly halfway around the circle from point P. Arrows are drawn along the circumference of the circle, indicating a counterclockwise direction of motion. A dashed line connects points P and Q, passing through the center of the circle. The arrows show that the particle moves from point P towards point Q in a counterclockwise manner."
