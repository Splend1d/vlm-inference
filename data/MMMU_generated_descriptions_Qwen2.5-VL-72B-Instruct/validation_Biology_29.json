    "options": "['<image 1>', '<image 2>', '<image 3>', '<image 4>', '<image 5>']",
    "id": "validation_Biology_29",
    "description": "**Image 1:** This structure represents a disaccharide composed of two glucose units linked by an \u03b1-1,4 glycosidic bond. The left glucose unit has a free anomeric carbon (the one attached to the oxygen in the ring), indicating it's in its open-chain form. The right glucose unit is part of the ring structure with a carbonyl group at the end. This is characteristic of maltose.\n\n**Image 2:** This structure shows a disaccharide where one glucose unit is linked to a fructose unit via an \u03b1-1,2 glycosidic bond. The glucose unit has a free anomeric carbon, while the fructose unit forms a five-membered ring. This is characteristic of sucrose.\n\n**Image 3:** This structure depicts a disaccharide with two glucose units connected by a \u03b2-1,4 glycosidic bond. Both glucose units are in their ring forms, and there are no free anomeric carbons. This is characteristic of cellobiose.\n\n**Image 4:** This structure shows a disaccharide with two glucose units linked by an \u03b1-1,6 glycosidic bond. One glucose unit has a free anomeric carbon, while the other is part of the ring structure. This is characteristic of isomaltose.\n\n**Image 5:** This structure represents a disaccharide with two glucose units linked by an \u03b1-1,4 glycosidic bond, similar to Image 1. However, both glucose units are in their ring forms, and there are no free anomeric carbons. This is also characteristic of maltose but in its cyclic form.\n\n\n### Answer:\nThe primary disaccharide digestion product of starch is **A. Maltose**, which corresponds to **Image 1** or **Image 5**. Starch is primarily digested into maltose due to the \u03b1-1,4 glycosidic linkages present in its structure."
