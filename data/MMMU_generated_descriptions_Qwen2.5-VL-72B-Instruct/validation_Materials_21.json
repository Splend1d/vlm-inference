    "description": "The image depicts a horizontal beam supported by two vertical supports at points A and B. The beam has a total length of 12 feet, with support A located at the left end and support B at the right end. The beam is subjected to a triangular distributed load that varies linearly from 0 kip/ft at the center of the beam (point C) to 6 kip/ft at both ends (points A and B).\n\nKey dimensions and points along the beam:\n- Point A: Leftmost support.\n- Point C: Center of the beam, located 6 feet from either end.\n- Point D: Located 3 feet to the right of point C, making it 9 feet from point A and 3 feet from point B.\n- Point B: Rightmost support.\n\nThe triangular load distribution creates a symmetrical loading pattern about the center of the beam (point C). The load intensity increases linearly from 0 kip/ft at point C to 6 kip/ft at points A and B.\n\nTo determine the internal loadings at point D, consider the following:\n- **Axial Force (N_D):** Since the beam is symmetrically loaded and supported, there is no axial force at any cross-section, so \\( N_D = 0 \\).\n- **Shear Force (V_D):** The shear force at point D can be calculated by considering the area under the load curve to the left of point D. The load to the left of D forms a trapezoid with a height of 3 kip/ft at D and 6 kip/ft at A over a distance of 9 feet. The shear force is the negative of the area under this trapezoid.\n- **Bending Moment (M_D):** The bending moment at point D is the integral of the shear force diagram up to point D or the sum of moments due to the distributed load to the left of D about point D.\n\nGiven these considerations, the correct option for the internal loadings at point D is:\n\n**D. \\( N_D = 0 \\), \\( V_D = 4.50 \\) kip, \\( M_D = 36.0 \\) kip\u00b7ft**\n\nThis matches the calculated values based on the described load distribution and beam geometry."
