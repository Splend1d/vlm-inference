    "description": "The image depicts a fluid mechanics scenario involving an open water jet exiting from a nozzle into sea-level air and striking a stagnation tube. The setup includes the following details:\n\n- **Water Level and Pressure**: At section (1), there is a water column with a height of 12 cm. The centerline pressure at this section is given as 110 kPa.\n  \n- **Nozzle and Jet**: The water flows through a nozzle, which reduces the water column height to 4 cm as it exits as an open jet. This indicates a change in the cross-sectional area and velocity of the water as it moves from section (1) to the nozzle exit.\n\n- **Stagnation Tube**: The open jet strikes a stagnation tube, where the kinetic energy of the jet is converted to pressure energy. The height difference between the water level at section (1) and the stagnation tube is denoted as \\( H \\).\n\n- **Sea-Level Air**: The open jet exits into sea-level air, implying atmospheric conditions at the exit point.\n\nTo solve for the mass flow rate in kg/s, the Bernoulli equation and continuity equation would be applied, considering the given pressure at section (1), the heights involved, and neglecting any losses. The specific values and relationships among these parameters will lead to the calculation of the mass flow rate. The options provided for the mass flow rate are A. 0.04 kg/s, B. 4.19 kg/s, and C. 5.25 kg/s."
