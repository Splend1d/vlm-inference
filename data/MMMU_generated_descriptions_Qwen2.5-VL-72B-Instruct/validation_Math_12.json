    "description": "The image depicts a flow diagram consisting of three interconnected blocks labeled \"1,\" \"2,\" and \"3.\" Each block has input and output variables associated with it:\n\n1. **Block 1**:\n   - Input: \\( \\tilde{S}_2 \\) (which is equal to \\( S_1 \\))\n   - Output: \\( r_1 \\)\n   - Additional variable: \\( d_1 \\)\n\n2. **Block 2**:\n   - Input: \\( \\tilde{S}_3 \\) (which is equal to \\( S_2 \\))\n   - Output: \\( r_2 \\)\n   - Additional variable: \\( d_2 \\)\n\n3. **Block 3**:\n   - Input: \\( S_3 \\)\n   - Output: \\( r_3 \\)\n   - Additional variable: \\( d_3 \\)\n\nThe relationships between these variables are as follows:\n- \\( r_1 = 3d_1 \\)\n- \\( r_2 = 3d_2 \\)\n- \\( r_3 = 3d_3^2 \\)\n\nAdditionally, there are constraints provided in the question:\n- \\( S_{i-1} = 3S_i - d_i \\) for \\( i = 1, 2, 3 \\)\n- \\( S_i \\geq d_i \\geq 0 \\)\n\nThe objective is to maximize \\( 3\\sum_{i=1}^{3} r_i \\).\n\nGiven the structure and the relationships described, the optimal values for \\( d_1, d_2, \\) and \\( d_3 \\) need to satisfy both the constraints and the objective function. The correct option should align with these conditions."
