    "description": "The image depicts a diagram illustrating a water flow scenario. A hose with an unknown velocity (V?) at its entrance leads to a nozzle with a diameter of 0.375 inches. The nozzle directs water towards a garden located 125 feet away. The diagram also includes an arrow labeled \"Pinside?\" pointing towards the hose, indicating the need to determine the internal pressure within the hose. The question specifies that the hose has a diameter of 0.625 inches and is too short, necessitating the calculation of the minimum gauge pressure required inside the hose for the water to reach the garden, assuming no losses in the system. The options provided for the minimum gauge pressure are:  \nA. 3000 lbf/ft\u00b2  \nB. 3600 lbf/ft\u00b2  \nC. 3400 lbf/ft\u00b2  \n\nThe image does not provide additional details about the flow rate or other physical properties of the water, but it clearly sets up the problem of calculating the necessary internal pressure in the hose given the distances and diameters involved."
