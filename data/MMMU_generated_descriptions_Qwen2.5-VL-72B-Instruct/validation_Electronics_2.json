    "description": "The image shows a sinusoidal waveform labeled as (a). The horizontal axis represents time (t), measured in milliseconds (ms), ranging from -1 ms to 4 ms. The vertical axis represents current (i), measured in amperes (A), ranging from -4 A to 4 A. \n\nKey points on the graph:\n- At t = 0 ms, the current i is 0 A.\n- The current reaches its peak positive value of 4 A at approximately t = 1 ms.\n- The current crosses the zero line again at t = 2 ms.\n- The current reaches its peak negative value of -4 A at approximately t = 3 ms.\n- The current returns to 0 A at t = 4 ms.\n\nThe waveform is symmetric about the horizontal axis, indicating it is a pure sine wave with an amplitude of 4 A. The period of the waveform is 4 ms. \n\nTo find the effective (rms) value of this sinusoidal current, you would use the formula for the rms value of a sine wave: \\( I_{rms} = \\frac{I_{peak}}{\\sqrt{2}} \\), where \\( I_{peak} \\) is the peak current. In this case, \\( I_{peak} = 4 \\) A. Therefore, \\( I_{rms} = \\frac{4}{\\sqrt{2}} = 2\\sqrt{2} \\) A."
