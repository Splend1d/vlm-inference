    "description": "The image is a vibrant poster featuring a woman in an expressive pose. She has flowing red hair and is dressed in a black dress with yellow and gray accents, paired with a red skirt. The woman's head is tilted back, and her arms are raised, suggesting movement or dance. The background is plain beige, which makes the colors of her attire and hair stand out prominently. On the left side of the poster, the name \"JANE Avril\" is written in bold, black letters. In the bottom right corner, there is a signature that reads \"H. de Toulouse-Lautrec,\" along with the year \"1899.\" The style of the artwork is characteristic of Art Nouveau, with its fluid lines and emphasis on form and color. The overall composition and signature clearly indicate the artist responsible for this piece."
