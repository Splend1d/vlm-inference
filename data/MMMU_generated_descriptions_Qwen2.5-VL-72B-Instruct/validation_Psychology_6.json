    "question": "<image 1> Assuming each dash in the above figure represents the addition of a reinforcer, which learning curve represents a variable ratio reinforcement schedule?",

    "description": "The image is a graph with two axes: the vertical axis labeled \"Cumulative number of responses\" and the horizontal axis labeled \"Time.\" The graph displays five distinct learning curves, labeled A through E, each representing different patterns of cumulative responses over time. \n\n- Curve A shows a steep, almost linear increase in the cumulative number of responses over time, with relatively consistent intervals between each dash (representing the addition of a reinforcer). This suggests a fixed interval reinforcement schedule.\n  \n- Curve B also shows an increasing trend but with more variability in the intervals between dashes compared to Curve A. The intervals are somewhat irregular, indicating a less predictable pattern of reinforcement.\n  \n- Curve C has a similar increasing trend to Curve B but with even more variability in the intervals between dashes. The pattern is quite erratic, suggesting a highly unpredictable reinforcement schedule.\n  \n- Curve D exhibits a very irregular pattern with large fluctuations in the intervals between dashes. There are periods where the cumulative number of responses increases rapidly followed by long pauses with no responses. This pattern is indicative of a variable ratio reinforcement schedule, where the number of responses required for a reinforcer varies unpredictably.\n  \n- Curve E is a flat line with no dashes, indicating no responses or reinforcements over time.\n\nGiven this description, the learning curve that represents a variable ratio reinforcement schedule is Curve D. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. D"
