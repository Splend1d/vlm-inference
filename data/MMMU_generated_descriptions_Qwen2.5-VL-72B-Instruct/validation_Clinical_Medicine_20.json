    "description": "The image shows an electrocardiogram (ECG) tracing printed on graph paper. The ECG displays a regular rhythm with distinct P waves preceding each QRS complex. The P waves are upright and consistent in morphology, indicating atrial depolarization. The PR interval appears to be prolonged, suggesting a delay in conduction between the atria and ventricles. The QRS complexes are narrow and uniform, indicating normal ventricular depolarization. There are no signs of ventricular pacing or idioventricular activity. The overall appearance suggests a sinus rhythm with a prolonged PR interval.\n\nBased on this description, the rhythm depicted in the image is most consistent with **D. NSR with 1st Degree AV Block**. The regularity of the rhythm, the presence of P waves before each QRS complex, and the prolonged PR interval are characteristic features of first-degree atrioventricular block in the context of normal sinus rhythm."
