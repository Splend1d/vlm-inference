    "question": "Select the correct left view based on the main and top views().<image 1>",
    "options": "['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']",
    "id": "validation_Mechanical_Engineering_3",
    "description": "The image consists of three views: a front view, a top view, and four options for the left view labeled (a), (b), (c), and (d).\n\n- **Front View**: The front view shows a square shape with a smaller square cutout in the center. There are dashed lines indicating hidden edges or features behind the visible surfaces.\n  \n- **Top View**: The top view shows a rectangular shape with a circular cutout near the bottom edge. The dashed lines indicate hidden features, suggesting there is a hollow or recessed area within the rectangle.\n\n- **Option (a)**: This option shows a rectangular shape with a curved indentation on the right side and a small rectangular cutout on the left side. There are dashed lines indicating hidden features.\n\n- **Option (b)**: This option shows a rectangular shape with a curved indentation on the left side and a small rectangular cutout on the right side. There are dashed lines indicating hidden features.\n\n- **Option (c)**: This option shows a rectangular shape with a small rectangular cutout on the left side and no significant indentation. There are dashed lines indicating hidden features.\n\n- **Option (d)**: This option shows a rectangular shape with a curved indentation on the right side and no significant cutout. There are dashed lines indicating hidden features.\n\nBased on the front and top views, the correct left view should match the orientation and features indicated by the dashed lines and cutouts. The correct option is likely to have a curved indentation corresponding to the circular cutout in the top view and a small rectangular cutout corresponding to the smaller square cutout in the front view. \n\nTherefore, the correct left view is Option (a)."
