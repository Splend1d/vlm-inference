    "question": "Reto Zach studied the whelk-eating behavior of the Northwestern crow. Below are two flight paths that the crow could assume when eating whelks: <image 1>. Select the flight path that would be used most often and the response that best supports your answer.",
    "options": "['Flight Path A: the crow has a wider view of his surroundings to assure that another bird will not steal the whelk', 'Flight Path A: the crow is maximizing the height to drop the whelk', 'Flight Path A: the crow is adding force to the downward movement to the whelk by flying higher', 'Flight Path B: the crow can see where the whelk lands', 'Flight Path B: the crow is throwing the whelk to the ground']",

    "description": "The image shows two flight paths labeled A and B for a Northwestern crow engaged in whelk-eating behavior. \n\n- **Flight Path A**: The crow is depicted flying at a relatively low altitude with its wings extended. The flight path is almost straight down, indicating a direct descent towards the ground. There is no significant curve or arc in this path.\n  \n- **Flight Path B**: The crow is shown flying at a higher altitude initially, then curving downwards in an arc before descending towards the ground. This path suggests that the crow gains some height before dropping the whelk.\n\nBoth paths end with the crow releasing the whelk from its beak, but the key difference lies in the initial height and the curvature of the flight path. Flight Path A involves a more direct and lower-altitude approach, while Flight Path B involves a higher altitude and a curved descent."
