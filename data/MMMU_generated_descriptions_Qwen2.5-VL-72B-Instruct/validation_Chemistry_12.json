    "description": "The image consists of five Newman projections representing different molecular configurations. The first projection (the reference compound) shows the following arrangement:\n\n- **Front carbon:** \n  - Up: H (hydrogen)\n  - Right: Br (bromine)\n  - Down: Me (methyl group)\n  - Left: OH (hydroxyl group)\n\n- **Back carbon:** \n  - Up: H (hydrogen)\n  - Right: Br (bromine)\n  - Down: Et (ethyl group)\n  - Left: Me (methyl group)\n\nThe other four projections (a, b, c, and d) represent potential enantiomers or diastereomers of the reference compound. Each projection has the same substituents but with different spatial arrangements around the carbons:\n\n- **Projection (a):**\n  - Front carbon:\n    - Up: H\n    - Right: Br\n    - Down: Me\n    - Left: HO\n  - Back carbon:\n    - Up: H\n    - Right: Br\n    - Down: Me\n    - Left: Et\n\n- **Projection (b):**\n  - Front carbon:\n    - Up: H\n    - Right: Br\n    - Down: Me\n    - Left: OH\n  - Back carbon:\n    - Up: H\n    - Right: Br\n    - Down: Me\n    - Left: Et\n\n- **Projection (c):**\n  - Front carbon:\n    - Up: Br\n    - Right: Me\n    - Down: HO\n    - Left: Me\n  - Back carbon:\n    - Up: Br\n    - Right: H\n    - Down: Me\n    - Left: Et\n\n- **Projection (d):**\n  - Front carbon:\n    - Up: Br\n    - Right: Me\n    - Down: H\n    - Left: OH\n  - Back carbon:\n    - Up: Br\n    - Right: H\n    - Down: Et\n    - Left: Me\n\nAn enantiomer is a non-superimposable mirror image of a molecule. To identify the enantiomer, one must find the projection where all the substituents are in mirror-image positions relative to the reference compound."
