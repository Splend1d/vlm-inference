    "question": "The introduction of the oral contraceptive(OC) in the 1960s provided an additional effective means of family planning, but it also had unanticipated side effects, particularly the susceptibility to thromboembolism. Women taking OC had an increased risk of pulmonary, cerebral, and coronary thrombosis or embolism.A larger case-control study was conducted in the United States between 1976-1978 by Shapiro et al. to explore the relationship between OC use and myocardial infarction(MI) in women under 50 years of age.The age distribution of the MI and control groups and OC exposure among MI patients and controls in each age group were shown in the table below.<image 1> The 95% CI for OR in 25-29 years was",

    "description": "The image presents a table summarizing data from a case-control study examining the relationship between oral contraceptive (OC) use and myocardial infarction (MI) in women under 50 years old. The table is divided into two main sections: \"Age groups (years)\" and \"OC exposure.\" \n\n### Age Groups Section:\nThis section lists five age groups: 25~, 30~, 35~, 40~, and 45~49. Each age group has corresponding data for the \"MI group\" and \"Control group,\" showing the number of cases and their respective percentages within each group.\n\n- **25~:** \n  - MI group: 6 cases (2.6%)\n  - Control group: 286 cases (16.4%)\n\n- **30~:** \n  - MI group: 21 cases (9.0%)\n  - Control group: 423 cases (24.3%)\n\n- **35~:** \n  - MI group: 37 cases (15.8%)\n  - Control group: 356 cases (20.4%)\n\n- **40~:** \n  - MI group: 71 cases (30.3%)\n  - Control group: 371 cases (21.3%)\n\n- **45~49:** \n  - MI group: 99 cases (42.3%)\n  - Control group: 306 cases (17.6%)\n\nThe total number of cases across all age groups is also provided:\n- Total MI group: 234 cases (100.0%)\n- Total Control group: 1742 cases (100.0%)\n\n### OC Exposure Section:\nThis section provides information about OC exposure within the MI and Control groups for each age category.\n\n- **25~:**\n  - MI with OC exposure: 4 cases (66.7%)\n  - Control with OC exposure: 62 cases (21.7%)\n\n- **30~:**\n  - MI with OC exposure: 9 cases (42.9%)\n  - Control with OC exposure: 33 cases (7.8%)\n\n- **35~:**\n  - MI with OC exposure: 4 cases (10.8%)\n  - Control with OC exposure: 26 cases (7.3%)\n\n- **40~:**\n  - MI with OC exposure: 6 cases (8.5%)\n  - Control with OC exposure: 9 cases (2.4%)\n\n- **45~49:**\n  - MI with OC exposure: 6 cases (6.1%)\n  - Control with OC exposure: 5 cases (1.6%)\n\nThe totals for OC exposure across all age groups are:\n- Total MI with OC exposure: 29 cases (12.4%)\n- Total Control with OC exposure: 135 cases (7.7%)\n\nTo calculate the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the odds ratio (OR) in the 25-29 years age group, you would need the numbers of exposed and unexposed individuals in both the MI and control groups. From the table:\n\n- MI group with OC exposure: 4 cases\n- MI group without OC exposure: 6 - 4 = 2 cases\n- Control group with OC exposure: 62 cases\n- Control group without OC exposure: 286 - 62 = 224 cases\n\nUsing these values, you can compute the OR and its 95% CI. The correct option for the 95% CI for OR in the 25-29 years age group is **B. (3.48~22.56)**."
