    "question": "In February 2014, the New England Journal of Medicine published in the same issue two epidemiological trials (field trials) of inactivated EV71 vaccine conducted by scholars in China respectively. One of the studies was from Jiangsu Province, China, and the study design was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial (phase III trial), which included a total of 10,077 healthy children aged 6-35 months. The primary outcome indicator was the incidence of EV71-related hand, foot and mouth disease or herpangina, according to the 0- and 28-day immunisation schedule, using block (one group of 10 persons) randomisation, with a 1:1 allocation of study participants to EV71 vaccine or placebo, and follow-up monitoring for 12 months, and the results were shown in the table below.<image 1> The protective rate against all EV71 related diseases was",

    "description": "The image presents a table summarizing the outcomes of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluating an inactivated EV71 vaccine. The trial involved 10,077 healthy children aged 6-35 months, divided equally into a vaccination group and a placebo group, each followed for 12 months. The table compares the number of new cases of various EV71-related conditions between the two groups:\n\n1. **EV71-related Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease or Herpangina**:\n   - Vaccination group: 5 new cases.\n   - Placebo group: 94 new cases.\n\n2. **Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease**:\n   - Vaccination group: 5 new cases.\n   - Placebo group: 90 new cases.\n\n3. **Herpangina**:\n   - Vaccination group: 0 new cases.\n   - Placebo group: 4 new cases.\n\n4. **EV71-related Hospitalization Events**:\n   - Vaccination group: 0 new cases.\n   - Placebo group: 24 new cases.\n\n5. **EV71-related Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease with Combined Neurological Complications**:\n   - Vaccination group: 0 new cases.\n   - Placebo group: 8 new cases.\n\n6. **All EV71-related Diseases**:\n   - Vaccination group: 13 new cases.\n   - Placebo group: 106 new cases.\n\nThe table also indicates the person-years of observation for both groups, with 4973.2 person-years for the vaccination group and 4873.0 person-years for the placebo group. \n\nTo calculate the protective rate against all EV71-related diseases, you would use the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Protective Rate} = \\left(1 - \\frac{\\text{Incidence in Vaccination Group}}{\\text{Incidence in Placebo Group}}\\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nWhere:\n- Incidence in Vaccination Group = 13 cases / 4973.2 person-years \u2248 0.00261 cases per person-year.\n- Incidence in Placebo Group = 106 cases / 4873.0 person-years \u2248 0.02175 cases per person-year.\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula gives:\n\n\\[ \\text{Protective Rate} = \\left(1 - \\frac{0.00261}{0.02175}\\right) \\times 100 \\approx 94.8\\% \\]\n\nThus, the protective rate against all EV71-related diseases is approximately 94.8%."
