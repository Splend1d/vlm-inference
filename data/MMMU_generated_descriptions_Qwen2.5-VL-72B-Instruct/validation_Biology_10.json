    "question": "If individual #1 in the following pedigree <image 1> is a heterozygote for a rare, AR disease, what is the probability that individual #7 will be affected by the disease? Assume that #2 and the spouses of #3 and #4 are not carriers.",

    "description": "The image is a pedigree chart representing family relationships and genetic inheritance patterns. Here's a detailed description:\n\n- **Individuals and Relationships:**\n  - Individual #1 (female) is connected to individual #2 (male), indicating they are a couple.\n  - They have two offspring: individual #3 (male) and individual #4 (female).\n  - Individual #3 is married to an unspecified female partner (not labeled with a number).\n  - Individual #4 is married to an unspecified male partner (not labeled with a number).\n  - Individual #5 (female) is the offspring of individual #3 and his partner.\n  - Individual #6 (male) is the offspring of individual #4 and her partner.\n  - Individual #7 (female) is the offspring of individual #5 and individual #6.\n\n- **Genetic Information:**\n  - Individual #1 is specified as a heterozygote for a rare autosomal recessive (AR) disease. This means she carries one normal allele and one disease-causing allele but does not show symptoms of the disease.\n  - Individual #2 and the spouses of individuals #3 and #4 are explicitly stated not to be carriers of the disease-causing allele. Therefore, they each have two normal alleles.\n\n- **Inheritance Pattern:**\n  - Since individual #1 is a heterozygote (Aa) and individual #2 has two normal alleles (AA), their offspring (#3 and #4) each have a 50% chance of being heterozygotes (Aa) like their mother and a 50% chance of having two normal alleles (AA) like their father.\n  - The spouses of #3 and #4 are not carriers (AA), so any children they have with #3 or #4 will inherit at most one disease-causing allele from #3 or #4 if they are heterozygotes.\n  - Individual #5, being the child of #3 and a non-carrier spouse, has a 50% chance of being a heterozygote if #3 is a heterozygote.\n  - Individual #6, being the child of #4 and a non-carrier spouse, has a 50% chance of being a heterozygote if #4 is a heterozygote.\n  - Individual #7, being the offspring of #5 and #6, would need both parents to be heterozygotes (Aa) to have a chance of inheriting the disease. If both #5 and #6 are heterozygotes, there is a 25% chance that #7 will inherit two disease-causing alleles (aa) and be affected by the disease.\n\nThis detailed description provides all necessary information to calculate the probability that individual #7 will be affected by the disease based on the given conditions."
