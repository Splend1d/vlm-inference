    "description": "The image depicts a kitchen layout focusing on the area around a sink. The sink is centrally located within a countertop. To the right of the sink, there is a dishwasher, which has a specified width of 24 inches. To the left of the sink, there is an open countertop space with a width of 18 inches. Above the countertop, there are cabinets with dimensions labeled: one cabinet to the left of the sink measures 24\" x 16\", and another cabinet to the right of the sink measures 18\" x 16\". The countertop spaces adjacent to the sink appear to be clear and unoccupied by any appliances or fixtures other than the dishwasher. The overall design suggests these areas are intended for use as working surfaces."
