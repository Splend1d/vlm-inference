    "question": "<image 1> The structural formula of the glycinium cation is shown above. Arrows indicate the $pK_a$ values for the labile protons in the molecule. Which of the following is true about the geometry of the glycinium cation?",
    "options": "['The leftmost C atom and all the atoms directly bonded to it lie in the same plane. ', 'Both C atoms and both O atoms lie in the same plane. ', 'The N-C-C bond angle is 180\u00b0.', 'The geometry around the N atom is planar.']",

    "description": "The image shows the structural formula of the glycinium cation. The structure consists of an amino group (NH3+) on the left side, a central carbon atom (C) bonded to another carbon atom (C), which is part of a carboxyl group (COOH). The amino group has three hydrogen atoms attached to the nitrogen (N) atom. The first carbon atom is bonded to the nitrogen atom and two hydrogen atoms. The second carbon atom is double-bonded to an oxygen (O) atom and single-bonded to a hydroxyl group (OH).\n\nThere are arrows indicating the pKa values for the labile protons in the molecule. One arrow points to the proton on the nitrogen atom with a pKa value of 9.6, and another arrow points to the proton on the hydroxyl group with a pKa value of 2.3.\n\nThe overall charge of the molecule is +1, indicated by the plus sign outside the brackets enclosing the structure. The bonds between the atoms are represented by lines, with a double line indicating a double bond between the second carbon and the oxygen atom. The lone pairs on the oxygen atoms are also shown.\n\nBased on this description, the geometry of the glycinium cation can be analyzed to determine which statement is true."
