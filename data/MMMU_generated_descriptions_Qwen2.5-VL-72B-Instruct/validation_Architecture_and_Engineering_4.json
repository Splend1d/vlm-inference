    "question": "As shown in the diagram, vertical leveling staffs are set up at points A and B. The level instrument is placed at point M. The reading on the A staff at the center crosshair is $a'_{M}=1.355m$, and the reading on the B staff at the center crosshair is $b'_{M}=1.455m$. When the level instrument is moved to point N, the reading on the A staff is $a'_{N}=1.585m$, and the reading on the B staff is $b'_{N}=1.485m$. What is the correct height difference $h_{AB}$ between points A and B?<image 1>",

    "description": "The image depicts a scenario involving differential leveling measurements between two points, A and B, using a level instrument. The setup includes two leveling staffs placed at points A and B, with the level instrument positioned at two different locations: M and N. \n\nKey details from the image:\n\n- **Points and Distances**: \n  - Point M is located 3 meters from point A.\n  - Point N is situated 70 meters from point A and 3 meters from point B.\n  \n- **Readings at Point M**:\n  - The reading on the leveling staff at point A when the instrument is at M ($a'_M$) is 1.355 meters.\n  - The reading on the leveling staff at point B when the instrument is at M ($b'_M$) is 1.455 meters.\n\n- **Readings at Point N**:\n  - The reading on the leveling staff at point A when the instrument is at N ($a'_N$) is 1.585 meters.\n  - The reading on the leveling staff at point B when the instrument is at N ($b'_N$) is 1.485 meters.\n\nThe goal is to determine the correct height difference ($h_{AB}$) between points A and B using these readings. The image provides all necessary data for calculating this height difference through standard leveling calculations."
