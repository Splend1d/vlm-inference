    "description": "The image consists of four graphs labeled (A), (B), (C), and (D). Each graph plots the variable \\( K \\) on the vertical axis against an unspecified horizontal axis. \n\n- **Graph (A)**: This graph shows a straight line starting from the origin (0,0) and extending upwards to the right at a constant positive slope. The line indicates a linear relationship between \\( K \\) and the horizontal axis.\n  \n- **Graph (B)**: This graph displays a straight line starting from a positive value on the \\( K \\)-axis and sloping downwards to the right until it reaches the horizontal axis. The line suggests a linear decrease in \\( K \\) as the horizontal axis increases.\n  \n- **Graph (C)**: This graph depicts a curve that starts near the origin and curves upwards, becoming steeper as the horizontal axis increases. The curve indicates an increasing rate of change for \\( K \\) with respect to the horizontal axis.\n  \n- **Graph (D)**: This graph shows a curve starting at a high value on the \\( K \\)-axis and curving downwards, approaching but not reaching the horizontal axis. The curve suggests a decreasing rate of change for \\( K \\) as the horizontal axis increases.\n\nThe question asks which graph best represents the maximum kinetic energy \\( K \\) of photoelectrons as a function of the frequency of incident light. According to the photoelectric effect, the maximum kinetic energy \\( K \\) is directly proportional to the frequency of the incident light, minus a threshold frequency. Therefore, the correct graph should show a linear increase in \\( K \\) with frequency, starting from zero when the frequency equals the threshold frequency. \n\nBased on this description, **Graph (A)** is the correct choice because it shows a linear relationship starting from the origin, consistent with the direct proportionality described by the photoelectric effect equation."
