    "question": "This two-year-old boy was brought to CHP with 3-week history of occipital headaches. The mother tells you he sleeps with his neck extended. During the last week prior to presenting to CHP he vomited once/day. On neurologic exam there was no noticeable weakness, gait abnormality, balance or visual changes. The mass lesion is partially resected. Your diagnosis? <image 1> <image 2>",
    "options": "['Pilocytic astrocytoma', 'Subependymoma', 'Glioblastoma', 'Anaplastic ependymoma', 'Medulloblastoma']",

    "description": "The provided images are MRI scans of the brain, specifically axial (horizontal) and sagittal (side) views. \n\n### Axial View (Image 1):\n- The axial view shows a well-defined, rounded mass located in the posterior fossa, which includes the cerebellum and brainstem.\n- The mass appears to have a cystic component, with a fluid-filled area visible within it.\n- There is no significant enhancement around the mass, suggesting a slow-growing tumor.\n- The surrounding brain tissue does not show signs of extensive edema or invasion, indicating a relatively benign behavior.\n\n### Sagittal View (Image 2):\n- The sagittal view confirms the location of the mass in the posterior fossa, extending into the fourth ventricle.\n- The mass appears to be compressing the brainstem and cerebellum, but there is no evidence of aggressive infiltration.\n- The cystic nature of the mass is again evident, with a clear separation between the solid and fluid components.\n- The overall appearance suggests a low-grade tumor with a tendency to form cysts.\n\n### Clinical Context:\n- The patient is a two-year-old boy with a history of occipital headaches, vomiting, and a preference for sleeping with the neck extended.\n- These symptoms are consistent with increased intracranial pressure due to a space-occupying lesion in the posterior fossa.\n- The lack of neurological deficits such as weakness, gait abnormalities, or visual changes further supports a relatively benign process.\n\n### Diagnosis:\nBased on the imaging findings and clinical presentation, the most likely diagnosis is **A. Pilocytic astrocytoma**. This type of tumor is common in children, typically presents with symptoms of increased intracranial pressure, and often has a cystic appearance on MRI. The other options (Subependymoma, Glioblastoma, Anaplastic ependymoma, and Medulloblastoma) are less likely given the imaging characteristics and clinical features described."
