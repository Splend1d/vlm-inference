    "question": "As shown in <image 1>, the Occupy Wall Street movement of 2011 grew to be an international movement. Supporters believe that the economic disparity between the highest economic class and the mid to lower economic classes is growing at an exponentially alarming rate. A sociologist who studies that movement by examining the interactions between members at Occupy camps would most likely use what theoretical approach?",
    "options": "['symbolic interactionism', 'functionalism', 'conflict theory', 'ethnocentrism']",

    "description": "The image depicts a scene from a protest or demonstration, likely associated with the Occupy Wall Street movement of 2011. The central figure is a man wearing a cap and a T-shirt with the text \"Black Spartacus\" and a graphic design featuring flags. He appears to be addressing a crowd, holding a microphone and possibly playing a guitar. The crowd consists of diverse individuals, some holding signs and banners, including one that reads \"TAKEOVER!\" with a symbol resembling anarchy. The setting is urban, with a building labeled \"Equitable Building\" in the background, traffic lights, and a mix of people engaged in various activities such as taking photos and listening to the speaker. The atmosphere suggests a collective action aimed at addressing social and economic issues, with a focus on direct communication and interaction among participants. \n\nGiven the context of the Occupy Wall Street movement and the emphasis on social and economic disparities, a sociologist studying the interactions between members at Occupy camps would most likely use **conflict theory** (Option C) to analyze the dynamics and motivations within the movement. Conflict theory focuses on the tensions and conflicts that arise from inequalities in society, which aligns well with the goals and actions depicted in the image."
