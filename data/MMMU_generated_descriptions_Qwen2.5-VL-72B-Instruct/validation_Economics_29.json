The table includes the following columns:\n\n- **Items**: Lists the four types of fruits.\n- **Qty**: Indicates the quantity of each fruit purchased. The quantities are:\n  - Apples: 10\n  - Bananas: 12\n  - Grapes: 2\n  - Raspberries: 1\n- **(2001) Price**: Shows the price per unit of each fruit in 2001. The prices are:\n  - Apples: $0.50\n  - Bananas: $0.20\n  - Grapes: $0.65\n  - Raspberries: $2.00\n- **(2002) Price**: Shows the price per unit of each fruit in 2002. The prices are:\n  - Apples: $0.75\n  - Bananas: $0.25\n  - Grapes: $0.70\n  - Raspberries: $1.90\n- **(2003) Price**: Shows the price per unit of each fruit in 2003.

The prices are:\n  - Apples: $0.88\n  - Bananas: $0.29\n  - Grapes: $0.95\n  - Raspberries: $2.13\n\nTo calculate the total amount spent each year on the \"basket\" of fruit, multiply the quantity of each fruit by its respective price for that year and sum the results.\n\nFor example, in 2001:\n- Apples: 10 * $0.50 = $5.00\n- Bananas: 12 * $0.20 = $2.40\n- Grapes: 2 * $0.65 = $1.30\n- Raspberries: 1 * $2.00 = $2.00\nTotal for 2001: $5.00 + $2.40 + $1.30 + $2.00 = $10.70\n\nSimilarly, calculate for other years:\n- For 2002: Total = $13.80\n- For 2003: Total = $15.35\n- For 2004: Total = $16.31\n\nThus, the correct option is A. 2001:$10.70; 2002:$13.80; 2003:$15.35; 2004:$16.31."
