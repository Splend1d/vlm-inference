    "description": "The image provides data for three joint products (M, N, and T) produced by Tango Company. The table includes the following columns:\n\n- **Product:** Lists the three products - M, N, and T.\n- **Units Produced and Sold:** Indicates the number of units for each product:\n  - Product M: 10,000 units.\n  - Product N: 4,000 units.\n  - Product T: 5,000 units.\n  \n- **After Split-Off:**\n  - **Total Separable Costs:** The additional costs incurred after the split-off point for each product:\n    - Product M: $10,000.\n    - Product N: $10,000.\n    - Product T: $5,000.\n  - **Total Final Sales Value:** The total revenue generated from selling each product after the split-off point:\n    - Product M: $160,000.\n    - Product N: $140,000.\n    - Product T: $25,000.\n\nThe question mentions a joint cost of $120,000 for the batch produced in April. To allocate this joint cost using the net realizable value method, you need to calculate the net realizable value (NRV) for each product, which is the final sales value minus the separable costs. Then, allocate the joint cost based on the proportion of each product's NRV to the total NRV of all products. \n\nThe NRVs are calculated as follows:\n- Product M: $160,000 - $10,000 = $150,000.\n- Product N: $140,000 - $10,000 = $130,000.\n- Product T: $25,000 - $5,000 = $20,000.\n\nThe total NRV is $150,000 + $130,000 + $20,000 = $300,000.\n\nThe allocation of the joint cost ($120,000) is then:\n- Product M: ($150,000 / $300,000) * $120,000 = $60,000.\n- Product N: ($130,000 / $300,000) * $120,000 = $52,000.\n- Product T: ($20,000 / $300,000) * $120,000 = $8,000.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. M: $60,000; N: $51,996; T: $8,004."
