    "description": "The image presents a table summarizing the results of a compaction test conducted on five different soil samples intended for use in an embankment on a highway project. The table includes three columns: \"Sample No.\", \"Moisture Content,\" and \"Bulk Density (g/cc).\" \n\nHere's the detailed data:\n\n- **Sample No. 1**: Moisture Content = 4.8%, Bulk Density = 2.164 g/cc\n- **Sample No. 2**: Moisture Content = 7.5%, Bulk Density = 2.322 g/cc\n- **Sample No. 3**: Moisture Content = 7.8%, Bulk Density = 2.351 g/cc\n- **Sample No. 4**: Moisture Content = 8.9%, Bulk Density = 2.345 g/cc\n- **Sample No. 5**: Moisture Content = 9.7%, Bulk Density = 2.327 g/cc\n\nThe moisture content values range from 4.8% to 9.7%, while the bulk density values range from 2.164 g/cc to 2.351 g/cc. The highest bulk density observed is 2.351 g/cc, which corresponds to a moisture content of 7.8%. The moisture content values closest to this are 7.5%, 8.9%, and 9.7%."
