    "description": "The image depicts a sequence of nodes connected by arrows pointing in one direction. Each node contains two parts: a \"data\" section and an arrow pointing to the next node. The first node has a \"data\" section followed by an arrow pointing to the second node. This pattern continues with each subsequent node having its own \"data\" section and an arrow pointing to the next node in line. The final node in the sequence also has a \"data\" section but instead of pointing to another node, its arrow points to \"null,\" indicating the end of the sequence. There are no backward-pointing arrows or circular connections between the nodes. The nodes are arranged linearly, and each node is connected only to the next one in a single direction."
