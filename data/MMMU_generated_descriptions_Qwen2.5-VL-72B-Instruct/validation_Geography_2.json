    "question": "In the joint rose diagram, which of the following is the meaning of the length of the straight line segment that projects from the center of the semicircle in the radial direction?<image 1>",
    "options": "['Joint tendency', 'Joint dip angle', ' Joint strike', 'Number of joints']",

    "description": "The provided image does not depict a joint rose diagram or any elements related to joint orientation analysis. Instead, it shows a cross-sectional view of a geological or engineering structure. The image includes:\n\n- A horizontal scale with measurements indicating distances of 32 meters and 15 meters.\n- A vertical scale showing depths ranging from 0 to 13 meters below the surface.\n- A rectangular section extending vertically from the surface down to 7 meters depth, with a width of 3 meters.\n- An adjacent irregularly shaped section extending further down to 10 meters depth, also with a width of 3 meters.\n- A third section to the right, with an irregular top boundary, extending down to 10 meters depth and a width of 15 meters.\n\nThe image lacks any semicircles, radial lines, or other features typically found in a joint rose diagram. Therefore, the question about the meaning of the length of the straight line segment projecting from the center of a semicircle cannot be answered based on this image. The image is unrelated to joint rose diagrams and their components."
