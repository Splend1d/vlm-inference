    "description": "The image depicts a three-hinged, parabolic arch labeled ABC with specific dimensions and points of interest. Here's a detailed description:\n\n- **Arch Structure**: The arch is a three-hinged structure with hinges at points A, B, and C. Point A is located at the left end of the arch, point B is at the topmost part of the arch, and point C is at the right end.\n  \n- **Dimensions**:\n  - The horizontal span \\( L \\) between points A and C is 175 feet.\n  - The height \\( h \\) from the base (line AC) to the top of the arch (point B) is 150 feet.\n  - There is an intermediate point D on the arch, which is vertically aligned with a point on the base that is 100 feet from point C.\n\n- **Equation of the Arch**: The shape of the arch follows a parabolic equation given by \\( y = \\frac{4hx^2}{L^2} \\), where \\( x \\) is the horizontal distance from point A.\n\n- **Point Load**: A vertical point load \\( P \\) of 3 kips is applied at point B.\n\n- **Axes**: The coordinate system has its origin at point A, with the x-axis running horizontally along the base from A to C, and the y-axis running vertically upward from A.\n\n- **Objective**: The task involves constructing influence lines for the reactions at point C, and determining the shear, axial load, and moment at point D when the load \\( P \\) is applied at B. Specifically, the question asks for the shear load at point D under this loading condition.\n\n- **Options for Shear Load at D**: The provided options for the shear load at D are:\n  - A. -1.84 kips (compression)\n  - B. -1.94 kips (compression)\n  - C. -1.74 kips (compression)\n\nThis description should enable someone to understand the problem setup and solve for the shear load at point D using the given information and principles of structural analysis."
