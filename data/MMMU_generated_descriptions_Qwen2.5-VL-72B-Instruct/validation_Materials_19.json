    "description": "The image shows a rectangular piece of plastic with dimensions 400 mm by 300 mm. The rectangle is labeled with vertices A, B, C, and D, where A is at the bottom right, B is at the top right, C is at the top left, and D is at the bottom left. The original positions of the corners are indicated by dashed lines, while the deformed positions are shown in solid lines.\n\nThe deformation of the rectangle is described by the following changes:\n- Corner A moves to the right by 3 mm.\n- Corner B moves up by 4 mm and to the right by 5 mm.\n- Corner C moves up by 2 mm and to the left by 2 mm.\n- Corner D moves down by 2 mm and to the left by 2 mm.\n\nThe diagonal AC is the line connecting corner A (bottom right) to corner C (top left). To determine the average normal strain along this diagonal, we need to calculate the change in length of the diagonal AC due to the deformation and divide it by the original length of the diagonal.\n\nThe original length of the diagonal AC can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\\[ AC_{\\text{original}} = \\sqrt{400^2 + 300^2} = \\sqrt{160000 + 90000} = \\sqrt{250000} = 500 \\text{ mm} \\]\n\nAfter deformation, the new coordinates of A and C are:\n- A: (400 + 3, 0 - 2) = (403, -2)\n- C: (0 - 2, 300 + 2) = (-2, 302)\n\nThe new length of the diagonal AC is:\n\\[ AC_{\\text{new}} = \\sqrt{(403 - (-2))^2 + (-2 - 302)^2} = \\sqrt{(403 + 2)^2 + (-2 - 302)^2} = \\sqrt{405^2 + (-304)^2} = \\sqrt{164025 + 92416} = \\sqrt{256441} = 506.4 \\text{ mm} \\]\n\nThe change in length of the diagonal AC is:\n\\[ \\Delta AC = AC_{\\text{new}} - AC_{\\text{original}} = 506.4 - 500 = 6.4 \\text{ mm} \\]\n\nThe average normal strain along the diagonal AC is:\n\\[ \\epsilon_{AC} = \\frac{\\Delta AC}{AC_{\\text{original}}} = \\frac{6.4}{500} = 0.0128 = 12.8 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ mm/mm} \\]\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{12.8 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ mm/mm}} \\]"
