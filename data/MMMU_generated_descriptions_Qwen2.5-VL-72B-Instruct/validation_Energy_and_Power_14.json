    "description": "The image depicts a U-tube manometer with three different liquids: water, gasoline, and an unknown liquid with a specific gravity (SG) of 1.60. The setup is as follows:\n\n- On the left side of the U-tube, there is a column of water with a height of 1.5 meters.\n- On the right side of the U-tube, there is a column of gasoline with a height of 1.5 meters.\n- Below the water and gasoline columns, there is a common section filled with the unknown liquid with a specific gravity of 1.60. This section has a height of 1 meter.\n- There is a height difference \"h\" between the top surface of the gasoline and the top surface of the unknown liquid in the common section.\n\nThe question asks for the height \"h\" in the third liquid (the unknown liquid with SG = 1.60). The options provided are:\nA. 5.69 m\nB. 2.37 m\nC. 1.52 m\n\nTo solve this problem, you would need to use the principle of hydrostatic equilibrium and the relationship between pressure, density, and height of the liquids. The specific gravity of the unknown liquid is given as 1.60, which means its density is 1.6 times the density of water. The densities of water and gasoline are also needed for the calculation, but they are standard values that can be assumed or looked up. The goal is to find the height \"h\" that balances the pressures at the bottom of the U-tube."
