    "description": "The image depicts a U-tube manometer setup with three different fluids: water, Meriam red oil (with a specific gravity, SG, of 0.827), and mercury. The manometer has two pressure points labeled A and B, where point A is connected to a water column and point B is connected to a mercury column. \n\nThe vertical distance between the top of the water column at point A and the top of the Meriam red oil column is given as 18 cm. The horizontal distance between the two legs of the U-tube is denoted by \"H,\" which is the unknown height we need to find. The vertical distance from the bottom of the mercury column at point B to the interface between the Meriam red oil and mercury is 35 cm.\n\nThe specific gravity of Meriam red oil is provided as 0.827, and the densities of water and mercury at 20\u00b0C are standard values (water density \u2248 1000 kg/m\u00b3, mercury density \u2248 13595 kg/m\u00b3). The difference in pressure between points B and A is given as 97 kPa. The task is to determine the height \"H\" in centimeters using this information."
