    "description": "The image presents a table with data for three stocks labeled A, B, and C. The table includes columns for prices ($P_0$, $P_1$, $P_2$) and shares outstanding ($Q_0$, $Q_1$, $Q_2$) at different time periods (t = 0, t = 1, and t = 2). Here's the detailed breakdown:\n\n- **Stock A:**\n  - $P_0 = 90$\n  - $Q_0 = 100$\n  - $P_1 = 95$\n  - $Q_1 = 100$\n  - $P_2 = 95$\n  - $Q_2 = 100$\n\n- **Stock B:**\n  - $P_0 = 50$\n  - $Q_0 = 200$\n  - $P_1 = 45$\n  - $Q_1 = 200$\n  - $P_2 = 45$\n  - $Q_2 = 200$\n\n- **Stock C:**\n  - $P_0 = 100$\n  - $Q_0 = 200$\n  - $P_1 = 110$\n  - $Q_1 = 200$\n  - $P_2 = 55$\n  - $Q_2 = 400$\n\nIt is also mentioned that Stock C undergoes a two-for-one split in the last period (from $t=1$ to $t=2$). This means that the number of shares doubles while the price per share is halved. \n\nTo calculate the rate of return for the second period ($t=1$ to $t=2$), you would use the formula:\n\\[ \\text{Rate of Return} = \\frac{P_2 - P_1}{P_1} \\]\n\nFor Stock C, after adjusting for the stock split, the effective price at $t=2$ remains $55$ because the split does not affect the total value but redistributes it among more shares. Therefore, the calculation is:\n\\[ \\text{Rate of Return} = \\frac{55 - 110}{110} = \\frac{-55}{110} = -0.5 \\]\n\nHowever, since the question asks for the rate of return and the options provided do not include negative values, it suggests focusing on the other stocks or re-evaluating the context. Given the options, the correct interpretation might involve a different calculation or context not directly visible from the provided data."
