    "description": "The image depicts a laboratory setup designed to demonstrate a chemical reaction involving ammonium carbonate. The apparatus includes the following components:\n\n1. **Burner**: Positioned at the bottom left, it serves as the heat source.\n2. **Ammonium Carbonate**: A small container holding ammonium carbonate is placed above the burner. This substance is being heated by the flame from the burner.\n3. **Glass Tubing and Rubber Tubing**: These connect the ammonium carbonate container to a test tube containing limewater. The glass tubing is directly connected to the ammonium carbonate container, while the rubber tubing connects the glass tubing to the test tube with limewater.\n4. **Test Tube with Limewater (Ca(OH)\u2082(aq))**: This test tube is located on the right side of the setup. Limewater is used to detect the presence of carbon dioxide (CO\u2082).\n\nThe setup suggests that when ammonium carbonate is heated, it decomposes into water (H\u2082O), carbon dioxide (CO\u2082), and ammonia (NH\u2083). The carbon dioxide produced reacts with the limewater, causing it to turn cloudy or milky, which is an indication of the presence of CO\u2082.\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the decomposition of ammonium carbonate is:\n\\[ \\text{(NH}_4\\text{)}_2\\text{CO}_3 \\rightarrow \\Delta \\text{ H}_2\\text{O} + \\text{CO}_2 + 2\\text{NH}_3 \\]\n\nThis equation accurately represents the reaction taking place in the depicted setup. Therefore, the statement \"The balanced equation for the reaction is (NH\u2084)\u2082CO\u2083 -> \u0394 H\u2082O + CO\u2082 + 2NH\u2083\" is correct.\n\n**Answer: A. True**"
