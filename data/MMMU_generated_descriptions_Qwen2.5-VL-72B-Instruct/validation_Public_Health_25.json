    "description": "The image presents a 2x2 contingency table used to evaluate the performance of a diagnostic or screening test. The table categorizes individuals into four groups based on their test results (positive or negative) and their actual disease status (with disease or without disease). Here's a detailed breakdown:\n\n- **Rows** represent the test result: \n  - \"Positive\" indicates those who tested positive.\n  - \"Negative\" indicates those who tested negative.\n\n- **Columns** represent the actual disease status:\n  - \"Group with disease\" includes individuals who actually have the disease.\n  - \"Group without disease\" includes individuals who do not have the disease.\n\n- **Cells** contain the counts of individuals in each category:\n  - **A**: Number of individuals who tested positive and actually have the disease (true positives).\n  - **B**: Number of individuals who tested positive but do not have the disease (false positives).\n  - **C**: Number of individuals who tested negative but actually have the disease (false negatives).\n  - **D**: Number of individuals who tested negative and do not have the disease (true negatives).\n\n- **Marginal totals**:\n  - The row totals are:\n    - A + B: Total number of individuals who tested positive.\n    - C + D: Total number of individuals who tested negative.\n  - The column totals are:\n    - A + C: Total number of individuals who actually have the disease.\n    - B + D: Total number of individuals who do not have the disease.\n  - N: The grand total of all individuals (A + B + C + D).\n\nSpecificity is defined as the proportion of true negatives among those who do not have the disease. Based on this definition and the table structure, specificity is calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Specificity} = \\frac{\\text{Number of true negatives}}{\\text{Total number of individuals without the disease}} = \\frac{D}{B + D} \\]\n\nThus, the correct option is:\n\nD. D/(B+D)"
