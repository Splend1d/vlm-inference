    "description": "The image is a pedigree chart depicting the inheritance pattern of a genetic trait across multiple generations. Here's a detailed description:\n\n- The chart includes three generations.\n- The first generation consists of one affected female (indicated by a filled circle) and one unaffected male (indicated by an open square).\n- In the second generation:\n  - The affected female from the first generation has five children with an unaffected male. Among these children, there are two affected males (filled squares), one affected female (filled circle), and two unaffected females (open circles).\n  - There is another unaffected female (open circle) who has four children with an unaffected male (open square). Among these children, there are two affected males (filled squares) and two unaffected females (open circles).\n- In the third generation:\n  - One of the affected males from the second generation has two children with an unaffected female. Both children are unaffected (one male and one female, both open symbols).\n  - Another affected male from the second generation has three children with an unaffected female. All three children are unaffected (two males and one female, all open symbols).\n  - An affected female from the second generation has three children with an unaffected male. All three children are unaffected (two males and one female, all open symbols).\n\nThe key observations are:\n- Affected individuals are present in every generation.\n- Both males and females can be affected.\n- Affected parents can have unaffected children.\n- Unaffected parents can have affected children.\n\nBased on this description, the most likely mode of inheritance can be determined."
