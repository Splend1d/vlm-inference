    "question": "You are shown subtraction <image 1>, T2 weighted <image 2> and T1 weighted axial <image 3> images from a screening breast MRI. What is the etiology of the finding in the left breast?",

    "description": "The provided images are axial slices from a breast MRI study, showing the left breast with specific findings:\n\n**Image 1 (Subtraction Image):**\n- There is a well-defined area of increased signal intensity in the left breast.\n- The enhancement pattern appears heterogeneous, with some areas showing more intense brightness compared to others.\n- The shape of the enhanced region is somewhat irregular but does not have sharp or spiculated margins.\n\n**Image 2 (T2-weighted Image):**\n- The same region in the left breast shows high signal intensity, which is characteristic of fluid or edema.\n- The high signal is relatively homogeneous within the lesion, suggesting the presence of a fluid-like substance.\n- There is no significant surrounding edema or skin thickening.\n\n**Image 3 (T1-weighted Image):**\n- On this image, the lesion in the left breast appears hypointense relative to the surrounding breast tissue.\n- The borders of the lesion are relatively well-defined, and there is no evidence of calcifications or solid components within it.\n\nBased on these observations:\n- The lesion enhances on the subtraction image, indicating vascularity or fluid dynamics.\n- The high signal on the T2-weighted image suggests the presence of fluid.\n- The hypointensity on the T1-weighted image further supports the presence of a fluid-filled structure rather than a solid mass.\n\nGiven these characteristics, the most likely etiology of the finding in the left breast is **B. Hematoma**. The combination of heterogeneous enhancement, high T2 signal, and low T1 signal is consistent with a collection of blood products at various stages of degradation, which is typical for a hematoma. Other options like fat necrosis or silicone granuloma would typically show different signal characteristics on T1 and T2 sequences. Susceptibility artifact is unlikely given the smooth and consistent appearance of the lesion."
