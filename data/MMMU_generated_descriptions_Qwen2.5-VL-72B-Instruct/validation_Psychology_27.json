    "question": "In an experiment, researchers randomly assigned college students in an introductory calculus class into four groups. All groups were given the same set of questions in an exam, but the exam began with a brief introductory statement that differed for each group, establishing differing expectations for student performance, as follows: Group A: The introduction stated that most students are expected to pass the exam. Group B: The introduction stated that most students are expected to fail the exam. Group C: The introduction included statistics that showed female students performing worse than male students on similar exams. Group D: The introduction contained no information on expected performance. The results of the experiment are given in the bar graph below: <image 1> What phenomenon best explains the performance differences between Groups A and B?",
    "options": "['Social facilitation', 'Group polarization', 'Self-serving bias', 'Unstable attribution', 'The Pygmalion effect']",

    "description": "The image is a bar graph depicting the average scores of male and female college students across four different groups (labeled A, B, C, and D) in an introductory calculus exam. The x-axis represents the four groups, while the y-axis shows the score averages ranging from 50 to 95. Each group has two bars representing males (dark gray) and females (light gray).\n\nHere's a detailed breakdown of the scores:\n\n- **Group A**: Both males and females scored around 80.\n- **Group B**: Males scored approximately 70, and females scored slightly lower at about 65.\n- **Group C**: Males scored around 78, while females scored significantly lower at about 65.\n- **Group D**: Males scored around 75, and females scored slightly higher at about 77.\n\nThe graph indicates that the performance of both males and females varied across the groups, with notable differences in scores between Group A and Group B. Specifically, both genders performed better in Group A compared to Group B. \n\nThe question provided describes the experimental setup where each group received a different introductory statement before the exam. Group A was told that most students are expected to pass, while Group B was informed that most students are expected to fail. The performance differences observed in the graph suggest that the expectations set by these statements may have influenced the students' performance. This aligns with the concept of the Pygmalion effect, which posits that higher expectations lead to improved performance. Therefore, the phenomenon best explaining the performance differences between Groups A and B is the Pygmalion effect."
