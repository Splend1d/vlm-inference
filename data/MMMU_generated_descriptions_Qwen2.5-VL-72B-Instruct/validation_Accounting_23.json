    "description": "The image presents a table comparing two put options labeled A and B. Both options have identical parameters except for their prices:\n\n- **Option A**:\n  - Time to expiration (T): 0.5 years\n  - Strike price (X): $50\n  - Volatility (\u03c3): 0.2\n  - Price of Option: $10\n\n- **Option B**:\n  - Time to expiration (T): 0.5 years\n  - Strike price (X): $50\n  - Volatility (\u03c3): 0.2\n  - Price of Option: $12\n\nBoth options share the same time to expiration, strike price, and volatility. The only difference is in their respective prices, with Option B being more expensive than Option A. \n\nThe question asks which put option must be written on the stock with the lower price, assuming a risk-free interest rate of 6% and that the underlying stocks do not pay dividends."
