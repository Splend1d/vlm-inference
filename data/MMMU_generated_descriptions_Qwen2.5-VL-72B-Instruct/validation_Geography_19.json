    "question": "Which of the following options is not included in the hazard assessment of geological hazards?<image 1>",
    "options": "['Land subsidence', 'Ground collapse', ' Ground fissures', 'Earthquake']",
    "id": "validation_Geography_19",
    "description": "The image provided is a technical drawing or blueprint of a structural element, likely part of a building or infrastructure. The drawing includes dimensions and labels for various parts of the structure. \n\nKey details from the image:\n\n- The overall dimensions of the structure are 2400 mm (length) by 1800 mm (height).\n- There are two labeled sections: \"1\u53f7\" (likely meaning \"No. 1\") at the top and \"2\u53f7\" (likely meaning \"No. 2\") at the bottom.\n- The structure appears to have a central rectangular section with four circular cutouts or holes, one in each corner. These circular features are labeled with a diameter dimension of 150 mm.\n- The central rectangular section has dimensions of 1200 mm by 600 mm.\n- The outer edges of the structure have additional details, possibly indicating reinforcement or connection points.\n\nThe image does not contain any information related to geological hazards such as land subsidence, ground collapse, ground fissures, or earthquakes. It is purely a structural design diagram with no reference to geological conditions or events. Therefore, none of the options A, B, C, or D are included in the image's content."
