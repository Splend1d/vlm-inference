    "question": "A 39-year-old woman has noted a 'bump' on her neck for the past 6 months. On physical examination there is a firm, well-circumscribed, non-tender nodule to the right of midline in her neck. She undergoes thyroidectomy and the microscopic appearance of the lesion is shown here. Which of the following statements regarding her disease is most appropriate? <image 1> ",
    "options": "['The serum TSH is probably increased', 'She will probably survive for at least 10 years', 'Anti-microsomal and anti-thyroglobulin antibodies are detectable', 'A dietary iodine deficiency probably preceded its appearance', 'The patient has relatives with a similar condition']",

    "description": "The image provided is a histological section stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), showing a tissue sample from the thyroid gland. The section reveals a well-defined nodule with a distinct border. Within this nodule, there are numerous follicles filled with colloid, which is characteristic of thyroid tissue. The follicular cells lining these structures appear uniform and are arranged in a single layer around the colloid-filled spaces. \n\nIn the center of the nodule, there is a small area of hemorrhage or necrosis, indicated by the presence of a dark, irregularly shaped structure surrounded by a pale halo. This central feature suggests some degree of degenerative change within the nodule. The surrounding thyroid parenchyma appears relatively normal, with no significant signs of inflammation or other abnormalities.\n\nThe overall appearance of the nodule is consistent with a benign follicular adenoma, a common type of thyroid nodule. Follicular adenomas are typically well-circumscribed, encapsulated nodules composed of thyroid follicles and are generally considered benign. They do not usually cause hyperthyroidism, so the serum TSH level is likely to be within the normal range. \n\nGiven the benign nature of follicular adenomas, patients with this condition have an excellent prognosis, and survival for at least 10 years is highly probable. There is no direct association between follicular adenomas and autoimmune thyroid diseases, so the presence of anti-microsomal and anti-thyroglobulin antibodies is unlikely. Dietary iodine deficiency is not a known cause of follicular adenomas. Finally, while some thyroid conditions can have a familial component, follicular adenomas are not typically inherited.\n\nBased on the description of the image and the clinical scenario, the most appropriate statement regarding the patient's disease is:\n\n**B. She will probably survive for at least 10 years**."
