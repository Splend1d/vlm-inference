    "description": "The image is a black-and-white diagram of a human heart viewed from the right side. The heart's major structures are labeled with letters A through E. \n\n- **A** points to the superior vena cava, which is a large vein located at the top of the heart.\n- **B** indicates the sinoatrial (SA) node, which is a small cluster of specialized cells situated in the upper wall of the right atrium near the opening of the superior vena cava.\n- **C** labels the right atrium, which is the chamber of the heart that receives deoxygenated blood from the body via the superior and inferior vena cavae.\n- **D** points to the right ventricle, which pumps deoxygenated blood to the lungs via the pulmonary artery.\n- **E** indicates the inferior vena cava, which is a large vein that carries deoxygenated blood from the lower half of the body into the right atrium.\n\nThe SA node is a critical part of the heart's electrical conduction system, responsible for initiating each heartbeat. It is located in the upper portion of the right atrium, near the junction with the superior vena cava."
