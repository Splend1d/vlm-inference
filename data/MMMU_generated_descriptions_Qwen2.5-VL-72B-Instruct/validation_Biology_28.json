    "description": "The image is a detailed anatomical illustration of a cross-sectional view of the knee joint. Various structures within the knee are labeled with numbers. The section appears to show the internal components of the knee, including ligaments, tendons, cartilage, and other soft tissues.\n\n- Label **158** points to the outermost layer, which seems to represent the skin or subcutaneous tissue.\n- Label **159** indicates a layer beneath the skin, possibly representing the fascia or subcutaneous fat.\n- Label **160** points to a structure that appears to be part of the bone, likely the tibia or femur.\n- Label **161** points to a structure that looks like a meniscus, which is a C-shaped cartilage in the knee joint.\n- Label **162** points to what appears to be another part of the bone, possibly the femur.\n- Label **163** points to a structure that resembles a tendon, possibly the patellar tendon.\n- Label **164** points to a structure that appears to be a ligament extending from one bone to another, located laterally in the knee joint.\n- Label **165** points to a structure that appears to be another ligament, possibly the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), located more centrally in the knee joint.\n\nBased on the location and appearance of the structure labeled **164**, it is situated laterally in the knee joint and connects two bones. This suggests that it is a collateral ligament. Given its lateral position, it is most likely the **Fibular collateral ligament**. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer to the question \"In the Section of knee, identify the 164 structure\" is:\n\n**B. Fibular collateral ligament**."
