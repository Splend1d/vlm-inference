    "description": "The image presents a table detailing the average cost per unit for various cost categories associated with producing a product. The table lists the following items along with their respective average costs:\n\n- **Direct materials:** $10 per unit\n- **Direct labor:** $9 per unit\n- **Indirect materials:** $3 per unit\n- **Fixed manufacturing overhead:** $6 per unit\n- **Variable manufacturing overhead:** $2 per unit\n- **Fixed selling and administrative expenses:** $8 per unit\n- **Variable sales commissions:** $14 per unit\n\nThe question provided mentions that Baxter Company's relevant range of production is between 15,000 and 30,000 units. The cost data in the table represents average variable costs per unit for 25,000 units of production. The question asks for the per unit manufacturing overhead costs incurred if 30,000 units are produced. \n\nTo determine this, it is important to note that manufacturing overhead includes both fixed and variable components. From the table:\n- Fixed manufacturing overhead is $6 per unit.\n- Variable manufacturing overhead is $2 per unit.\n\nSince fixed costs remain constant regardless of the number of units produced within the relevant range, the fixed manufacturing overhead will still be $6 per unit even when 30,000 units are produced. The variable manufacturing overhead will also remain at $2 per unit. Therefore, the total per unit manufacturing overhead costs (fixed + variable) would be $6 + $2 = $8 per unit. Thus, the correct answer is C. $8."
