    "description": "The image is a table presenting data related to a project's activities, their immediate predecessors, and estimated completion times in weeks. The table has four columns and five rows, including headers. Here's a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Headers:\n- **Column 1:** \"ACTIVITY\" - Lists the activities involved in the project.\n- **Column 2:** \"IMMEDIATE PREDECESSOR\" - Indicates which activity must be completed before the current one can start.\n- **Column 3:** \"TIME (WEEKS)\" - This column is further divided into three sub-columns labeled \"a,\" \"m,\" and \"b,\" representing the optimistic, most likely, and pessimistic time estimates for each activity, respectively.\n\n### Rows:\n- **Row 1 (Header):** Contains the column titles described above.\n- **Row 2:** \n  - Activity: A\n  - Immediate Predecessor: \u2014 (indicating no predecessor)\n  - Time Estimates: a = 9 weeks, m = 10 weeks, b = 11 weeks\n- **Row 3:** \n  - Activity: B\n  - Immediate Predecessor: \u2014 (indicating no predecessor)\n  - Time Estimates: a = 4 weeks, m = 10 weeks, b = 16 weeks\n- **Row 4:** \n  - Activity: C\n  - Immediate Predecessor: A (indicating it follows Activity A)\n  - Time Estimates: a = 9 weeks, m = 10 weeks, b = 11 weeks\n- **Row 5:** \n  - Activity: D\n  - Immediate Predecessor: B (indicating it follows Activity B)\n  - Time Estimates: a = 5 weeks, m = 8 weeks, b = 11 weeks\n\n### Additional Information:\n- The question refers to the path \"B-D,\" meaning the sequence of activities B followed by D.\n- The time estimates for path B-D would involve summing the respective values for activities B and D.\n- The optimistic time estimate for B-D is 4 + 5 = 9 weeks.\n- The most likely time estimate for B-D is 10 + 8 = 18 weeks.\n- The pessimistic time estimate for B-D is 16 + 11 = 27 weeks.\n- The question assumes that the time to complete path B-D is normally distributed and asks for the probability that this path will be finished in 22 weeks or less."
