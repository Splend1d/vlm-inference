    "description": "The image features a dark gray background with an artistic depiction of a bird in flight, seemingly made up of chain-link fence material. At the top, the word \"DREAMS\" is prominently displayed in large, bold, orange letters. Below this title, there is a poem written in white text. The poem reads:\n\n\"Hold onto dreams  \nFor if dreams die  \nLife is like a  \nbroken-winged bird  \nThat cannot fly  \nHold fast to dreams  \nFor when dreams go  \nLife is a barren field  \nFrozen with snow\"\n\nThe poem is attributed to Langston Hughes, whose name appears below the text in smaller white font. At the bottom of the image, there is a hashtag \"#dontgiveupworld\" in white text.\n\nThe poem emphasizes the importance of holding onto one's dreams and the negative consequences of losing them, comparing life without dreams to a broken-winged bird that cannot fly and a barren field frozen with snow. This imagery underscores the theme of the necessity of dreams for a fulfilling life."
