    "options": "['The roll waterproof layer is laid on the upstream surface of the external wall', 'The roll waterproof layer is laid on the back surface of the external wall', 'The outer wall roll adopts the empty laying method', ' When laying double layer coils, the two layers of coils are perpendicular to each other']",

    "description": "The image provided is a technical drawing illustrating the construction details of a basement exterior wall, focusing on the waterproofing layer. Here's a detailed breakdown:\n\n- **Wall Dimensions**: The drawing shows a vertical section of the basement wall with dimensions labeled. The wall thickness is 300 mm.\n  \n- **Waterproofing Layer Details**:\n  - There is a waterproofing layer depicted along the exterior side of the wall. This layer is shown as a continuous strip running vertically along the wall.\n  - The waterproofing layer is positioned on the **upstream (outer) surface** of the external wall, which is the side exposed to potential water intrusion from the soil outside the basement.\n  - The waterproofing layer appears to be applied directly onto the wall surface, suggesting it is not laid using an \"empty\" or loose-laying method but rather adhered or bonded to the wall.\n  \n- **Additional Layers**:\n  - There are multiple layers indicated in the drawing, including what seems to be a protective layer over the waterproofing material. However, these additional layers do not appear to be coiled materials perpendicular to each other; they seem to follow the same orientation as the primary waterproofing layer.\n  \n- **Foundation Details**:\n  - The drawing also includes details of the foundation slab and footing, showing their dimensions and how they connect to the wall. The waterproofing layer extends down to meet the foundation slab, ensuring comprehensive coverage.\n\nBased on this description, the correct method for constructing the waterproofing layer of the basement exterior wall with coiled materials is:\n\n**A. The roll waterproof layer is laid on the upstream surface of the external wall**\n\nThis option aligns with the depiction in the image, where the waterproofing layer is clearly shown on the outer surface of the wall. Options B, C, and D do not match the details provided in the image."
