At the top, it states: \"SO GREAT IS THE CHALLENGE OF CREATING SUSTAINABLE INDUSTRIES...\" followed by arrows pointing in a clockwise direction around the circle, connecting different concepts.\n\n1. The first arrow points to an icon of a light bulb with text saying \"...THAT MULTIPLE INNOVATIONS AND VISIONARY IDEAS ARE REQUIRED.\"\n2. Next, there's an illustration of buildings and factories with the text \"...INCLUDING STRATEGIES AND COMPETITIVE POSITIONS IN INDUSTRIES.\"\n3. Following this, there's an image of people holding hands in a circle with the text \"...ALL OF WHICH MUST BRIDGE MANY KINDS OF DIVERSITY AMONG STAKEHOLDERS.\"\n4. Then, there's a depiction of a person standing confidently with the text \"...AND DEVELOP THE HUMAN POTENTIALS AND COMPETENCIES OF ALL STAKEHOLDERS.\"\n5. Afterward, there's an image of a DNA double helix with the text \"LEADERS COMMUNICATE AND RECONCILE ALL SEVEN ELEMENTS IN A CYCLE OF CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT AND STEPPED EXCELLENCE, WITHIN A NETWORK OF WEALTH CREATING STAKEHOLDERS.\"\n6. Finally, there's an image of a globe with hands holding it, with the text \"...WHICH ARE SCIENTIFICALLY BENCHMARKED AND MEASURED.\"\n\nIn the center of the circle, there's a statement: \"...IN WAYS THAT DELIGHT CUSTOMERS AND PLEASE MARKETS.\"\n\nThe flowchart emphasizes multiple aspects of sustainability, including innovation, industry strategies, diversity among stakeholders, human potential development, continuous improvement, scientific benchmarking, and pleasing markets. However, it does not explicitly mention personal consumption as a component of sustainability. Therefore, based on the image, sustainability does not mean personal consumption. \n\nThus, the correct answer to the question is:\n\nB. personal consumption"
