    "description": "The image depicts a carbon chain with four bromine (Br) atoms attached to it. The structure consists of five carbon atoms in a straight chain. Each of the second, third, and fourth carbon atoms from one end has a bromine atom attached to it. Additionally, each of these three carbon atoms also has a methyl group (-CH\u2083) attached to them. The first and fifth carbon atoms have hydrogen atoms attached to complete their valence shells. \n\nThis compound can be represented as follows: CH\u2083-CH(Br)(CH\u2083)-CH(Br)(CH\u2083)-CH(Br)(CH\u2083)-CH\u2083. The presence of three chiral centers (the second, third, and fourth carbon atoms) indicates that this molecule can exhibit stereoisomerism. Each chiral center can exist in two configurations (R or S), leading to a total of 2\u00b3 = 8 possible stereoisomers. Therefore, the maximum number of stereoisomers that could exist for this compound is 8."
