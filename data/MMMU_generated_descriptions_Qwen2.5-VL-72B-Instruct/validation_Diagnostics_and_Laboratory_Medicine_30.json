    "question": "Which phrase best describes the pathology? <image 1>",
    "options": "['Subacute cerebral infarcts with extensive epithelioid vascular proliferation', 'Remote cerebral infarcts with metaplastic choroid plexus', 'Subacute embolic infarcts associated with glycogen (PAS-Positive) storage disease', 'Metastatic carcinoma with secondary infarcts']",
    "id": "validation_Diagnostics_and_Laboratory_Medicine_30",
    "description": "The image shows a histological section stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). The predominant feature is a large area of tissue that appears pale pink to lavender in color, which is characteristic of necrotic or infarcted brain tissue. This area lacks distinct cellular structures, suggesting tissue death. Surrounding this central area, there are thin bands of white material that likely represent remnants of blood vessels or connective tissue. There are no visible signs of active inflammation, such as numerous inflammatory cells, nor are there any features suggestive of epithelioid vascular proliferation, choroid plexus metaplasia, or metastatic carcinoma. The overall appearance is consistent with an old or remote infarct where the tissue has undergone significant degeneration and loss of structure. There are no visible signs of glycogen storage disease, such as PAS-positive material. \n\nBased on this description, the most appropriate phrase to describe the pathology is:\n\nB. Remote cerebral infarcts with metaplastic choroid plexus. However, the description does not provide evidence for metaplastic choroid plexus, so the best fit would be \"Remote cerebral infarcts.\""
