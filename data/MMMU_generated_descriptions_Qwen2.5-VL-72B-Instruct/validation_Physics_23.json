    "question": "<image 1>A square loop of wire of side 0.5 meter and resistance 10^{-2} ohm is located in a uniform magnetic field of intensity 0.4 tesla directed out of the page as shown. The magnitude of the field is decreased to zero at a constant rate in 2 seconds. As the field is decreased, what are the magnitude and direction of the current in the loop?",
    "options": "['Zero', '5 A, counterclockwise', '5 A, clockwise', '20 A, counterclockwise']",

    "description": "The image depicts a square loop of wire with a side length of 0.5 meters. The loop is situated within a uniform magnetic field. The magnetic field lines are represented by circles with dots in their centers, indicating that the field is directed out of the plane of the paper (or \"out of the page\"). The strength of this magnetic field is given as 0.4 tesla. \n\nThe diagram also includes an arrow labeled \"Magnetic Field,\" which points perpendicularly outward from the plane of the loop, reinforcing the direction of the magnetic field. The problem specifies that the magnitude of this magnetic field decreases uniformly to zero over a period of 2 seconds. Additionally, it is mentioned that the resistance of the square loop is \\(10^{-2}\\) ohms. \n\nThe question asks for the magnitude and direction of the current induced in the loop as the magnetic field decreases. The options provided are:\n\nA. Zero  \nB. 5 A, counterclockwise  \nC. 5 A, clockwise  \nD. 20 A, counterclockwise  \n\nThis information, combined with the principles of Faraday's law of induction and Lenz's law, should allow one to determine the correct answer."
