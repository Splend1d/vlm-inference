    "description": "The image is a line graph depicting the timeline of cases for a specific disease over the year 2010. The x-axis represents the dates from January 1, 2010, to November 1, 2010, while the y-axis shows the case serial numbers ranging from 0 to 20. Each case is represented by a horizontal line indicating the duration of the illness. \n\nKey points on each line include:\n- A circle (O) marking the onset of the disease.\n- An \"X\" marking the death of the patient.\n- A triangle (\u0394) marking recovery.\n- The lines extend horizontally between these markers, showing the duration of the illness.\n\nFrom the graph, we can observe the following:\n- There are 10 distinct cases represented.\n- The onset of the first case occurs around March 1, 2010.\n- The last case's onset is around October 1, 2010.\n- Some cases result in death, marked by \"X,\" while others recover, marked by \u0394.\n- The total number of cases is 10.\n\nTo calculate the incidence rate:\n- Incidence = (Number of new cases / Population at risk) * 100\n- Here, the number of new cases is 10, and the population at risk is 2,528.\n- Incidence = (10 / 2,528) * 100 \u2248 0.395%, which rounds to approximately 0.40%.\n\nThus, the incidence in 2010 is **B. 0.40%**."
