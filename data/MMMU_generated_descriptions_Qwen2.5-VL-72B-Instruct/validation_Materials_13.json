    "description": "The image shows a rectangular piece of plastic with dimensions 400 mm (length along the x-axis) and 300 mm (height along the y-axis). The rectangle is labeled with vertices A, B, C, and D in a clockwise manner starting from the bottom left corner. The original position of the rectangle is represented by solid lines, while its distorted shape after deformation is indicated by dashed lines.\n\n### Dimensions and Deformations:\n- **Vertex A**: Located at the bottom right corner of the rectangle.\n  - Original coordinates: (400 mm, 0 mm).\n  - After deformation, it shifts horizontally to the right by 3 mm and vertically downward by 2 mm.\n  \n- **Vertex B**: Located at the top right corner of the rectangle.\n  - Original coordinates: (400 mm, 300 mm).\n  - After deformation, it shifts horizontally to the right by 5 mm and vertically downward by 4 mm.\n  \n- **Vertex C**: Located at the top left corner of the rectangle.\n  - Original coordinates: (0 mm, 300 mm).\n  - After deformation, it shifts horizontally to the right by 2 mm and vertically downward by 2 mm.\n  \n- **Vertex D**: Located at the bottom left corner of the rectangle.\n  - Original coordinates: (0 mm, 0 mm).\n  - After deformation, it remains at the same position.\n\n### Shear Strain Calculation:\nShear strain \\( \\gamma_{xy} \\) at a point is given by the change in angle between two originally perpendicular lines meeting at that point. For corner B:\n\n- The horizontal line segment BA originally perpendicular to the vertical line segment BC gets deformed.\n- The new angle between these deformed lines can be calculated using the tangent function.\n\n#### Step-by-step calculation:\n1. **Change in horizontal distance** for line segment BA: \n   - Original length = 400 mm.\n   - New length = 400 mm + 5 mm = 405 mm.\n   \n2. **Change in vertical distance** for line segment BC:\n   - Original length = 300 mm.\n   - New length = 300 mm - 4 mm = 296 mm.\n\n3. **Calculate the tangent of the new angle**:\n   - Tangent of the new angle \\( \\theta \\) formed due to deformation at B:\n     \\[\n     \\tan(\\theta) = \\frac{\\text{change in vertical distance}}{\\text{change in horizontal distance}} = \\frac{4 \\text{ mm}}{5 \\text{ mm}} = 0.8\n     \\]\n\n4. **Shear strain \\( \\gamma_{xy} \\)**:\n   - Shear strain \\( \\gamma_{xy} \\approx \\theta \\) (in radians) when \\( \\theta \\) is small.\n   - Therefore, \\( \\gamma_{xy} \\approx \\tan(\\theta) = 0.8 \\).\n\nHowever, this value needs to be scaled appropriately considering the small deformations involved. Given the options, the closest match is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{11.6 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ rad}}\n\\]"
