    "question": "Refer to the figure <image 1>, which term best describes a large paper on which group members write, web, and sketch thoughts about a book?",
    "options": "['Graffiti Boards', 'Freewrites', 'Activity Books', 'Story Ray']",
    "id": "validation_Literature_14",
    "description": "The image shows a wall covered in colorful graffiti art. The graffiti includes stylized letters and a cartoon-like character with exaggerated features. The letters appear to spell out a word or phrase, but it is difficult to decipher due to the artistic style. The colors used are primarily blue, red, and white, with some black outlines. There is also a timestamp in the bottom right corner of the image indicating the time as 3:15:02. The wall appears to be indoors, possibly in an abandoned or unused space, as there are some items like a mattress and other debris on the floor. The overall scene suggests a creative and expressive use of space for artistic purposes. \n\nGiven the description, the term that best describes a large paper on which group members write, web, and sketch thoughts about a book is not directly related to the image content. However, among the given options, \"Graffiti Boards\" (Option A) could be loosely associated with the concept of a shared space for writing and sketching, similar to how the wall in the image is used for graffiti. The other options do not fit the context of the image as closely."
