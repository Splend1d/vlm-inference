    "description": "The image depicts a Balanced Scorecard (BSC) framework, which is a strategic planning and management system used by organizations to align business activities with their vision and strategy. The BSC is divided into four interconnected perspectives:\n\n1. **Financial Perspective**: This perspective focuses on how the organization appears to its shareholders. It includes objectives, measures, targets, and initiatives related to financial performance. The question associated with this perspective is: \"To succeed financially, how should we appear to our shareholders?\"\n\n2. **Customer Perspective**: This perspective centers on how the organization appears to its customers. It includes objectives, measures, targets, and initiatives related to customer satisfaction and value. The question for this perspective is: \"To achieve our vision, how should we appear to our customers?\"\n\n3. **Internal Business Processes Perspective**: This perspective looks at what internal processes must be excelled at to satisfy both shareholders and customers. It includes objectives, measures, targets, and initiatives related to internal operations. The question here is: \"To satisfy our shareholders and customers, what business processes must we excel at?\"\n\n4. **Learning & Growth Perspective**: This perspective focuses on how the organization will sustain its ability to change and improve. It includes objectives, measures, targets, and initiatives related to learning, growth, and innovation. The question for this perspective is: \"To achieve our vision, how will we sustain our ability to change and improve?\"\n\nEach perspective has a grid where specific objectives, measures, targets, and initiatives can be filled in. The central element labeled \"Vision and Strategy\" connects all four perspectives, indicating that they are aligned with the overall vision and strategy of the organization.\n\nBased on the description of the four perspectives, the KPIs that are applicable include:\n- Human Resource Management (related to Learning & Growth)\n- Technology (related to Internal Business Processes)\n- Marketing (related to Customer)\n- Operations (related to Internal Business Processes)\n\nTherefore, the KPI that is not included in the four perspectives of the BSC shown in the image is **C. marketing**. Marketing is more closely associated with the Customer perspective but is not explicitly listed as a separate KPI category in the provided options."
