    "description": "The image depicts a religious scene set within an architectural framework featuring arched columns and a loggia. On the left side, there is an angel with large, detailed wings, dressed in flowing robes of red and gold. The angel appears to be in a gesture of reverence or announcement, with hands clasped together. On the right side, a seated figure, presumably the Virgin Mary, is depicted wearing a dark cloak over a lighter garment. She is seated on a simple stool, with her hands folded in prayer, and has a halo around her head. The background includes a glimpse of greenery through the arches, suggesting an outdoor setting beyond the loggia. The painting style is characterized by soft colors, detailed textures, and a serene atmosphere. The artist's signature is visible at the bottom of the image, which reads \"Fra Angelico.\" This detail identifies the artist of the work."
