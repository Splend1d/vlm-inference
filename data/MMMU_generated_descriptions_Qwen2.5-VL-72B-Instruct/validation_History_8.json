    "description": "The image is a map titled \"Path of a late fifteenth century voyage.\" It illustrates a maritime route starting from Lisbon, Portugal, and extending across the Atlantic Ocean, around the southern tip of Africa, and into the Indian Ocean, ultimately reaching Calicut in India. The map highlights several key locations along this path:\n\n- **Lisbon**: The starting point of the voyage, located in Portugal.\n- **Cape Verde Islands**: An archipelago off the western coast of Africa, marked as a significant stop along the route.\n- **Natal**: A location on the southeastern coast of Africa, indicating a point where the voyage navigated around the continent.\n- **Malindi**: A port city on the eastern coast of Africa, serving as a stopping point before crossing the Indian Ocean.\n- **Calicut (Kozhikode)**: The final destination in India, situated on the western coast of the subcontinent.\n\nThe map also shows the Atlantic Ocean to the west and the Indian Ocean to the east, with Africa in between. The route depicted involves sailing southward from Lisbon, rounding the Cape of Good Hope at the southern tip of Africa, and then proceeding northward along the eastern coast of Africa before crossing the Indian Ocean to reach India.\n\nThe map does not provide any information about mass migrations or the first European to embark on intercontinental travel by sea. It focuses on the maritime journey and the exploration of coastal regions in Africa and Asia."
