The background is a solid yellow color, and the image has a dotted texture reminiscent of pop art techniques. Overlaid on the image is text in lowercase letters that reads, \"i think everybody should like everybody.\" In the bottom right corner, there is a signature that appears to read \"Andy Warhol,\" indicating the artist responsible for the work. The overall style and signature suggest that this image was created by Andy Warhol."
