    "description": "The image depicts an electrical circuit with several components connected in a specific configuration. The circuit includes resistors, current sources, voltage-controlled voltage sources (VCVS), and a dependent current source. Here's a detailed description:\n\n- There are four nodes labeled \\( n_1 \\), \\( n_2 \\), \\( n_3 \\), and the reference node (ground).\n- A 14A current source is connected between \\( n_1 \\) and the reference node.\n- A 20\u03a9 resistor is connected between \\( n_1 \\) and the reference node.\n- A 10\u03a9 resistor is connected between \\( n_1 \\) and \\( n_2 \\).\n- A 10\u03a9 resistor is also connected between \\( n_3 \\) and \\( n_2 \\).\n- A 5\u03a9 resistor is connected between \\( n_3 \\) and the reference node.\n- A 4A current source is connected between \\( n_3 \\) and the reference node.\n- A voltage-controlled voltage source (VCVS) with a gain of 0.5V per volt (\\( 0.5V \\cdot v_x \\)) is connected between \\( n_2 \\) and the reference node.\n- Another VCVS with a gain of 0.2V per volt (\\( 0.2V \\cdot n_2 \\)) is connected between \\( n_3 \\) and \\( n_2 \\).\n- A dependent current source with a gain of \\( 2v_x \\) is connected between \\( n_3 \\) and the reference node.\n\nThe goal is to find the voltage \\( v_x \\) at node \\( n_2 \\) relative to the reference node using a single nodal equation. \n\nTo solve for \\( v_x \\), apply Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) at node \\( n_2 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{v_x - 0}{10} + \\frac{v_x - 0.2v_x}{10} + \\frac{v_x - 0.5v_x}{5} = 0\n\\]\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{v_x}{10} + \\frac{0.8v_x}{10} + \\frac{0.5v_x}{5} = 0\n\\]\n\nCombine the terms:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{v_x}{10} + \\frac{0.8v_x}{10} + \\frac{v_x}{10} = 0\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2.8v_x}{10} = 0\n\\]\n\n\\[\n2.8v_x = 0\n\\]\n\n\\[\nv_x = 0 \\text{ V}\n\\]"
