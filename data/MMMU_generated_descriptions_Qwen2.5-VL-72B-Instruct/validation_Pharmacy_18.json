    "description": "The provided images depict three different graphs labeled as 1), 2), and 3). Each graph illustrates the relationship between the ratio of AUC (Area Under the Curve) to Dose on the y-axis and the Dose on the x-axis.\n\n- **Graph 1 (Image 1)**: This graph shows a downward-sloping curve. As the dose increases along the x-axis, the value of AUC/Dose decreases along the y-axis. The curve starts relatively high and gradually declines as the dose increases.\n\n- **Graph 2 (Image 2)**: This graph displays a horizontal line. The value of AUC/Dose remains constant regardless of changes in the dose. The line is flat, indicating no change in the ratio as the dose varies.\n\n- **Graph 3 (Image 3)**: This graph presents an upward-sloping curve. As the dose increases along the x-axis, the value of AUC/Dose also increases along the y-axis. The curve starts at a lower value and rises as the dose increases.\n\nTransdermal absorption by active transport typically results in a linear relationship between AUC and dose, meaning the AUC/Dose ratio should remain constant across different doses. Therefore, the correct representation for transdermal absorption by active transport would be:\n\n**B. Graph 2**"
