    "description": "The image depicts an abstract artwork consisting of nested squares. The outermost square is light blue, followed by a slightly smaller gray square inside it. Within the gray square is a white square, and finally, there is a mustard-yellow square at the center. The composition is simple and geometric, with each square centered within the larger one, creating a sense of depth and focus towards the yellow center. \n\nThis style of art is characteristic of Josef Albers, who is known for his work with color theory and geometric abstraction. Albers taught at various institutions, including Black Mountain College and Yale University. He was also associated with the Bauhaus school in Germany before its closure. In addition to his teaching career, Albers had a significant impact on modern art through his exploration of color relationships and perception. \n\nRegarding the specific details mentioned in the question: Josef Albers taught at schools, served as a tea server in 1925, had three paintings displayed at the George Eastman Hall of RIT (Rochester Institute of Technology), and completed a mural in Gosnell Hall. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is A. Josef Albers."
