    "description": "The image is a graph depicting the relationship between the maximum kinetic energy (\\(E_{km}\\)) of photoelectrons and the frequency (\\(f\\)) of the incident photons. The axes are labeled as follows:\n\n- The vertical axis represents \\(E_{km}\\) in electron volts (eV).\n- The horizontal axis represents the frequency \\(f\\) in units of \\(10^{14}\\) Hz.\n\nKey features of the graph include:\n\n- The \\(E_{km}\\) values range from approximately -1 eV to slightly above 2 eV.\n- The frequency \\(f\\) values range from 0 to 9 \\(\\times 10^{14}\\) Hz.\n- There is a straight line that starts at a negative value on the \\(E_{km}\\) axis and increases linearly with increasing frequency.\n- The line intersects the \\(E_{km}\\) axis at approximately -1.5 eV when the frequency is zero. This intersection point is significant because it corresponds to the work function of the material used in the photoelectric effect experiment.\n- The slope of the line indicates the proportionality between the frequency and the maximum kinetic energy, consistent with the photoelectric effect equation.\n\nBased on the graph, the work function of the material, which is the energy required to remove an electron from the material, is approximately 1.5 eV. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is A. 1.5 eV."
