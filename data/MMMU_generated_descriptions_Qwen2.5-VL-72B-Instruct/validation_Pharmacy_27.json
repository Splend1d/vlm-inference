    "question": "The manufacture of compound F requires five separate chemical reactions. The initial reactant, compound A, is converted to compound B, compound B is converted to compound C, and so on. The diagram below summarizes the steps in the manufacture of compound F, including the percent yield for each step. Provide the missing quantities or missing percent yields.Assume that the reactant and product in each step react in a one-to-one mole ratio. <image 1>",

    "description": "The image illustrates a multi-step chemical synthesis process involving compounds A through F. Here's a detailed breakdown:\n\n1. **Step 1: Compound A to Compound B**\n   - Initial quantity of Compound A: 10.0 mol.\n   - Percent yield from Compound A to Compound B: 40.0%.\n   - Resulting quantity of Compound B: 4.00 mol.\n\n2. **Step 2: Compound B to Compound C**\n   - Quantity of Compound B: 4.00 mol (from Step 1).\n   - Percent yield from Compound B to Compound C: Unknown (represented by \"____ % yield\").\n   - Resulting quantity of Compound C: 2.00 mol.\n\n3. **Step 3: Compound C to Compound D**\n   - Quantity of Compound C: 2.00 mol (from Step 2).\n   - Percent yield from Compound C to Compound D: 25.0%.\n   - Resulting quantity of Compound D: Unknown (represented by \"____ mol\").\n\n4. **Step 4: Compound D to Compound E**\n   - Quantity of Compound D: Unknown (from Step 3).\n   - Percent yield from Compound D to Compound E: 10.0%.\n   - Resulting quantity of Compound E: Unknown (represented by \"____ mol\").\n\n5. **Step 5: Compound E to Compound F**\n   - Quantity of Compound E: Unknown (from Step 4).\n   - Percent yield from Compound E to Compound F: Unknown (represented by \"____ % yield\").\n   - Resulting quantity of Compound F: 0.0100 mol.\n\nAll reactions proceed with a 1:1 mole ratio between reactants and products. The goal is to determine the missing quantities and percent yields for Steps 2, 3, 4, and 5."
