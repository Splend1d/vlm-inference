    "description": "The image displays four different cross-sectional shapes of cantilever beams, each subjected to a concentrated force \\( P \\) at their free ends. The cross-sectional shapes and the direction of the applied force \\( P \\) are as follows:\n\n1. **Rectangle**: The first cross-section is a simple rectangular shape. The force \\( P \\) is applied at an angle, not aligned with the principal axes of the rectangle.\n2. **Channel Steel**: The second cross-section resembles a channel steel profile (a C-shaped section). The force \\( P \\) is applied vertically, perpendicular to the web of the channel.\n3. **I-Beam**: The third cross-section is an I-beam or I-shaped profile. The force \\( P \\) is applied horizontally, parallel to the flanges of the I-beam.\n4. **Equilateral Angle Steel**: The fourth cross-section is an equilateral angle steel (an L-shaped section). The force \\( P \\) is applied at an angle, not aligned with the principal axes of the angle steel.\n\nEach beam is depicted as a cantilever, meaning it is fixed at one end and free at the other where the force \\( P \\) is applied. The orientation of the force \\( P \\) relative to the cross-sectional geometry is crucial for determining the type of deformation produced. \n\nFor the question provided, the focus is on identifying which cross-section results in a combined deformation of oblique bending and torsion when subjected to the given force \\( P \\). This occurs when the force \\( P \\) is applied at an angle that does not align with the principal axes of the cross-section, causing both bending about non-principal axes and twisting of the beam."
