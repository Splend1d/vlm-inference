    "description": "The image depicts two long, parallel wires separated by a distance \\( d \\). Both wires carry currents \\( i \\) that are directed into the page, indicated by the symbol \"\u2297\" at the ends of the wires. The wires are aligned horizontally, with one on the left and one on the right. The current in both wires flows perpendicularly away from the viewer, as suggested by the \"\u2297\" symbols. There are no other elements or forces depicted in the image. The focus is solely on the two wires, their separation distance \\( d \\), and the direction of the currents flowing through them."
