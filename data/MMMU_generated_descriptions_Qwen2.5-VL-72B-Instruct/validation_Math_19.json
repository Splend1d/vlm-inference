    "description": "The first image depicts a connected undirected graph with six vertices and eight edges. The vertices are labeled as follows: one vertex is labeled 'x', and the other five vertices are unlabeled but can be distinguished by their connections. The edges are labeled from \\( e_1 \\) to \\( e_8 \\). The connections between the vertices and the corresponding edge labels are as follows:\n\n- Vertex 'x' is connected to three other vertices via edges \\( e_1 \\), \\( e_2 \\), and \\( e_4 \\).\n- The vertex connected to 'x' via \\( e_1 \\) is also connected to another vertex via \\( e_6 \\).\n- The vertex connected to 'x' via \\( e_2 \\) is connected to another vertex via \\( e_3 \\).\n- The vertex connected to 'x' via \\( e_4 \\) is connected to two other vertices via \\( e_5 \\) and \\( e_7 \\).\n- The vertex connected to 'x' via \\( e_4 \\) and to another vertex via \\( e_7 \\) is also connected to the vertex connected to 'x' via \\( e_2 \\) and to another vertex via \\( e_3 \\) through edge \\( e_8 \\).\n\nThe second image shows a spanning tree of the graph in the first image. This spanning tree consists of five edges connecting all six vertices without forming any cycles. The edges in this spanning tree are \\( e_1 \\), \\( e_4 \\), \\( e_5 \\), \\( e_6 \\), and \\( e_8 \\).\n\nTo determine the fundamental cut sets of the graph with respect to the spanning tree, we consider each edge in the original graph that is not part of the spanning tree (i.e., \\( e_2 \\), \\( e_3 \\), \\( e_7 \\)). A fundamental cut set for an edge \\( e_i \\) not in the spanning tree is the set of edges that, when removed along with \\( e_i \\), disconnects the graph into two components where \\( e_i \\) would reconnect them.\n\nFor \\( e_2 \\): Removing \\( e_2 \\) and considering the spanning tree, the cut set is \\( \\{e_2, e_4, e_8\\} \\).\nFor \\( e_3 \\): Removing \\( e_3 \\) and considering the spanning tree, the cut set is \\( \\{e_3, e_7\\} \\).\nFor \\( e_7 \\): Removing \\( e_7 \\) and considering the spanning tree, the cut set is \\( \\{e_5, e_7, e_8\\} \\).\n\nThus, the fundamental cut sets are:\n\\[ \\{e_1, e_8\\}, \\{e_2, e_4, e_8\\}, \\{e_3, e_7\\}, \\{e_5, e_7, e_8\\}, \\{e_6, e_8\\} \\]\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
