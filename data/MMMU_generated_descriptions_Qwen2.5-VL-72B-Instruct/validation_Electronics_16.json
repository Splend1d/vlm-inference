    "description": "The image shows three different electrical circuit diagrams labeled as (a), (b), and (c). Each diagram represents a different circuit configuration with various components like resistors, inductors, voltage sources, current sources, and switches.\n\n### Diagram (a):\n- A 12V DC voltage source is connected to a series combination of a 6\u03a9 resistor, a 4\u03a9 resistor, and a 2H inductor.\n- A switch is placed between the 6\u03a9 resistor and the 4\u03a9 resistor.\n- The switch is shown in the open position at t=0.\n- The voltage across the 4\u03a9 resistor is denoted as 'v'.\n\n### Diagram (b):\n- A 100V DC voltage source is connected to a series combination of a 30\u03a9 resistor, a 20\u03a9 resistor, and a 5H inductor.\n- A switch is placed between the 30\u03a9 resistor and the 20\u03a9 resistor.\n- The switch is shown in the open position at t=0.\n- The current through the inductor is denoted as 'i'.\n\n### Diagram (c):\n- A 5A DC current source is connected to a parallel combination of two branches.\n- One branch consists of a 20\u03a9 resistor in series with a 10\u03a9 resistor.\n- The other branch consists of a 3\u03a9 resistor in series with an 8H inductor.\n- A switch is placed between the 3\u03a9 resistor and the 8H inductor.\n- The switch is shown in the open position at t=0.\n- The voltage across the 8H inductor is denoted as 'v'.\n\nTo find the voltage 'v' in figure (c) just after the switch is thrown, consider the behavior of the inductor. An inductor resists changes in current, so immediately after the switch is closed, the current through the inductor remains zero. Therefore, the entire 5A current from the current source flows through the 20\u03a9 and 10\u03a9 resistors in series.\n\nThe equivalent resistance of the 20\u03a9 and 10\u03a9 resistors in series is 30\u03a9. The voltage drop across this combination is:\n\\[ V = I \\times R = 5A \\times 30\u03a9 = 150V \\]\n\nSince the switch is just closed, there is no current through the 3\u03a9 resistor and the 8H inductor branch, meaning the voltage 'v' across the inductor is equal to the voltage across the 3\u03a9 resistor, which is also 150V. Thus, \\( v = 150V \\)."
