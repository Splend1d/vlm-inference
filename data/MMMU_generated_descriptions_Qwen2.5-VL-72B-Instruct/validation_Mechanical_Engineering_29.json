    "description": "The image depicts a mechanical system consisting of various springs arranged in a specific configuration. The system includes both torsional and linear springs, with their respective spring constants labeled as \\( k_1 \\), \\( k_2 \\), \\( k_3 \\), \\( k_4 \\), \\( k_5 \\), and \\( k_6 \\).\n\n### Components and Arrangement:\n1. **Torsional Springs (\\( k_1 \\), \\( k_2 \\), \\( k_3 \\), \\( k_4 \\)):**\n   - \\( k_1 \\): Located at the bottom of the system, attached to a fixed base.\n   - \\( k_2 \\): Positioned directly above \\( k_1 \\), connected in series with \\( k_1 \\).\n   - \\( k_3 \\): Positioned above \\( k_2 \\), also connected in series with \\( k_2 \\).\n   - \\( k_4 \\): Located at the top center of the system, connected to a rotating shaft or disk.\n\n2. **Linear Springs (\\( k_5 \\) and \\( k_6 \\)):**\n   - \\( k_5 \\): Positioned horizontally on the left side of the central rotating shaft or disk, connected to it via a radial arm of length \\( R \\).\n   - \\( k_6 \\): Positioned horizontally on the right side of the central rotating shaft or disk, connected to it via a radial arm of length \\( R \\).\n\n3. **Rotating Shaft/Disk:**\n   - The central component is a rotating shaft or disk with a radius \\( R \\). It is connected to the torsional springs \\( k_3 \\) and \\( k_4 \\) and the linear springs \\( k_5 \\) and \\( k_6 \\) via radial arms.\n\n### Connections and Interactions:\n- The torsional springs \\( k_1 \\), \\( k_2 \\), and \\( k_3 \\) are connected in series.\n- The linear springs \\( k_5 \\) and \\( k_6 \\) are connected to the rotating shaft/disk via radial arms of length \\( R \\). Their effect on the system is converted into a torsional effect due to the radial connection.\n- The torsional spring \\( k_4 \\) is directly connected to the rotating shaft/disk.\n\n### Key Parameters:\n- \\( R \\): Radius of the radial arms connecting the linear springs \\( k_5 \\) and \\( k_6 \\) to the rotating shaft/disk.\n- \\( \\theta \\): Angular displacement of the rotating shaft/disk (not explicitly used in the calculation but relevant for understanding the system's behavior).\n\n### Equivalent Torsional Spring Constant Calculation:\nTo find the equivalent torsional spring constant \\( k_{et} \\) of the system, we need to consider the contributions from both the torsional and linear springs. The torsional springs \\( k_1 \\), \\( k_2 \\), and \\( k_3 \\) are in series, while the linear springs \\( k_5 \\) and \\( k_6 \\) contribute to the torsional stiffness through the radial arms of length \\( R \\).\n\nThe correct formula for the equivalent torsional spring constant \\( k_{et} \\) is:\n\n\\[ k_{et} = \\left( \\frac{k_1 k_2 k_3}{k_2 k_3 + k_1 k_3 + k_1 k_2} \\right) + k_4 + R^2 (k_5 + k_6) \\]\n\nThis matches option B in the given question."
