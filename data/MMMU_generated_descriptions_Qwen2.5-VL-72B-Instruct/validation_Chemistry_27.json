    "description": "The image is a table presenting data on the ionic radii of various anions. The table has two columns: \"Ion\" and \"Ionic Radius (pm).\" The rows list four different ions along with their corresponding ionic radii:\n\n1. Ion: Cl\u207b, Ionic Radius: 181 pm\n2. Ion: I\u207b, Ionic Radius: 216 pm\n3. Ion: S\u00b2\u207b, Ionic Radius: 184 pm\n4. Ion: Te\u00b2\u207b, Ionic Radius: 221 pm\n\nThe ionic radius values are given in picometers (pm). The ions listed are all negatively charged, with Cl\u207b and I\u207b having a -1 charge, while S\u00b2\u207b and Te\u00b2\u207b have a -2 charge. The table provides no additional information beyond these ion names and their respective ionic radii."
