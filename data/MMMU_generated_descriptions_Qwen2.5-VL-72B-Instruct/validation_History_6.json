    "options": "['The Soviet Union saw communism as developing most effectively within a single country, while Marx envisioned it as an international movement', 'The Soviet Union saw communism as primarily a militaristic philosophy, while Marx argued for a peaceful approach', 'The Soviet Union saw communism as being fully realized by 1917, while Marx predicted the proletariat revolt to occur much later', 'The Soviet Union saw communism as a theoretical concept, while Marx attempted to implement a communist society']",

    "description": "The image is a black-and-white propaganda poster from the World War II era, originating from the Soviet Union. At the top of the poster, there is Russian text that translates to \"Young Men and Women, Defend the Freedom, Motherland, and Honor that was Won by your Fathers.\" Below this text, the year \"1917\" is prominently displayed, referencing the Russian Revolution. The central part of the poster features a group of soldiers dressed in winter military uniforms, holding rifles with bayonets. They appear determined and ready for battle, symbolizing a call to arms for the youth of the Soviet Union. The background shows a stylized depiction of a battlefield with explosions and smoke, emphasizing the urgency and importance of defending the nation.\n\nThe poster conveys a strong sense of nationalism and patriotism, urging young people to protect their homeland and uphold the values and achievements of their predecessors. This message highlights the Soviet Union's emphasis on national unity and defense, which contrasts with Karl Marx's vision of communism as an international movement aimed at uniting the global working class across national boundaries. The poster does not directly address the other options mentioned in the question, such as militarism, the timing of the proletarian revolution, or the theoretical versus practical aspects of communism. Therefore, the description supports the conclusion that the correct answer is:\n\nA. The Soviet Union saw communism as developing most effectively within a single country, while Marx envisioned it as an international movement."
