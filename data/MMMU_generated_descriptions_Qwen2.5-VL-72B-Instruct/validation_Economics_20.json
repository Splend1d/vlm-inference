    "description": "The image is a graph depicting the market for bagels, showing both the supply and demand curves along with a horizontal line representing the \"Price with Free Trade.\" The x-axis represents the \"Quantity of Bagels,\" ranging from 0 to 12 in increments of 1. The y-axis represents the \"Price of Bagels ($),\" ranging from 0 to 12 in increments of 1.\n\n- **Demand Curve**: This curve is downward sloping, indicating an inverse relationship between the price and quantity demanded. It starts at the top left corner (price = $12, quantity = 0) and ends at the bottom right corner (price = $0, quantity = 12).\n\n- **Supply Curve**: This curve is upward sloping, indicating a direct relationship between the price and quantity supplied. It starts at the bottom left corner (price = $0, quantity = 0) and extends upwards and to the right, intersecting the demand curve at a point where the price is approximately $8 and the quantity is approximately 4.\n\n- **Price with Free Trade**: A horizontal dashed line labeled \"Price with Free Trade\" is drawn at the $6 mark on the y-axis. This line intersects the demand curve at a quantity of about 7 bagels.\n\nThe equilibrium price when there is no trade is the price at which the supply and demand curves intersect. In this case, the intersection occurs at a price of approximately $8 and a quantity of approximately 4 bagels."
