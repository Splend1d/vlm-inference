    "options": "['Topoisomerase poison', 'Metallating agent', 'Chain terminator', 'Antisense agent']",
    "id": "validation_Pharmacy_24",
    "description": "The image depicts the molecular structure of a compound with the following features:\n\n- A central six-membered ring (quinoline-like) containing two nitrogen atoms.\n- One nitrogen atom is part of a five-membered ring fused to the quinoline ring, which also includes a carbonyl group (C=O).\n- The other nitrogen atom is part of a piperidine ring (a six-membered ring with one nitrogen atom), which is attached to the quinoline ring.\n- There is a carboxylic acid group (-CO2H) attached to the quinoline ring.\n- A fluorine (F) atom is attached to the quinoline ring.\n- A cyclopropyl group (a three-membered carbon ring) is attached to the nitrogen atom in the piperidine ring.\n\nThis compound is known as Mitoxantrone, an anthracycline derivative used as an antineoplastic agent. Its mechanism of action involves intercalation into DNA and inhibition of topoisomerase II, leading to DNA damage and cell death. Therefore, it acts as a **topoisomerase poison**."
