    "description": "The image shows a rectangular glass bottle with a golden-yellow liquid inside. The bottle has a square shape with rounded edges and a small, clear glass cap on top. On the front of the bottle, there is a white label with black text. The label reads \"N\u00b05\" at the top in a bold font, followed by \"CHANEL\" in a larger, elegant font, and then \"PARIS\" in a smaller font below it. Underneath, it says \"EAU DE PARFUM\" in a simple font. The overall design is minimalist and sophisticated, typical of high-end perfumes. The bottle appears to be a product ready for sale, with no additional elements or text indicating a manufacturing process, art, or history."
