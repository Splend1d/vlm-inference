    "question": "A simply supported beam is subjected to a linearly varying distributed load $q(x)=\\frac{x}{L}q_{0}$ with maximum intensity q0 at B. The beam has a length L = 4 m and rectangular cross section with a width of 200 mm and height of 300 mm. Determine the maximum permissible value for the maximum intensity, q0, if the allowable normal stresses in tension and compression are 120 MPa.<image 1>",

    "description": "The image depicts a simply supported beam labeled AB with a length denoted as \\( L \\). The beam is resting on supports at both ends A and B. The beam experiences a linearly varying distributed load \\( q(x) \\), which increases from zero at point A to a maximum value \\( q_0 \\) at point B. This load is represented by a series of downward-pointing arrows along the beam, with their lengths increasing progressively from left (point A) to right (point B).\n\nThe load distribution function is given as \\( q(x) = \\frac{x}{L} q_0 \\), where \\( x \\) is the distance measured from point A towards point B. The maximum load intensity \\( q_0 \\) occurs at point B.\n\nThe beam's length \\( L \\) is specified as 4 meters. The cross-section of the beam is rectangular, with a width of 200 mm and a height of 300 mm. The material properties indicate an allowable normal stress in both tension and compression of 120 MPa.\n\nThe problem requires determining the maximum permissible value for the maximum intensity \\( q_0 \\) under these conditions. The options provided for \\( q_0 \\) are:\n- \\( q_0 = 250.7403 \\frac{\\text{kN}}{\\text{m}} \\)\n- \\( q_0 = 350.7403 \\frac{\\text{kN}}{\\text{m}} \\)\n- \\( q_0 = 450.7403 \\frac{\\text{kN}}{\\text{m}} \\)\n\nThe image provides all necessary visual and numerical information required to solve for \\( q_0 \\) using the principles of mechanics of materials and structural analysis."
