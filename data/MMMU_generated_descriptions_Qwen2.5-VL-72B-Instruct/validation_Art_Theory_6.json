    "description": "The image depicts an intricate stone relief carving, likely part of a church or cathedral facade. The central figure appears to be Christ in Majesty, seated on a throne with a mandorla (an almond-shaped aureole) behind him, flanked by angels holding symbols of the Evangelists. The figures are arranged in a hierarchical manner, with smaller figures below and larger ones above, suggesting a sense of importance and reverence. The style of the carving is characterized by its heavy, blocky forms, lack of deep perspective, and emphasis on flat surfaces and linear patterns. The drapery of the garments is stylized with folds that appear more decorative than realistic. Surrounding the central figure are rows of smaller figures, possibly saints or apostles, depicted in a similar stylized manner. The overall composition is symmetrical and organized, with a strong emphasis on verticality and a lack of naturalistic detail. The architectural elements, such as the arches and columns, are also simplified and integrated into the overall design. The text inscriptions at the bottom suggest a narrative or dedicatory purpose. This style is indicative of Romanesque art, which flourished in Europe from approximately the 10th to the 12th century."
