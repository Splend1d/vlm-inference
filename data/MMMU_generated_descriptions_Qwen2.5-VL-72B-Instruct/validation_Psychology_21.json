    "question": "Understanding the various causes of psychological disorders is a central focus of research in psychology. Further, clinical psychologists must consider factors that influence the incidence rate and characteristics of clinical populations that they treat. The following graphs depict data from a study by L. R. Snowden and F. K. Cheung, who examined demographic differences in the incidence rate of schizophrenia. The first figure shows the percentage rates for schizophrenia diagnosis among individuals admitted for psychiatric care who classified themselves as\"African American,\" White,\" \"Hispanic American,\" or \"Asian American and other.\" <image 1> The following graph shows the percentage rates for mood disorder diagnosis among individuals admitted for psychiatric care, by the same ethnicity classifications. <image 2> Based on psychological research investigating the causes of schizophrenia, which of the following is NOT true?",
    "options": "['Schizophrenia has a genetic component that can be inherited from biological parents, but genetic factors alone cannot account for the development of the disorder.', 'The production and activity of specific chemical substances in the brain have been found to be associated with schizophrenia.', 'Environmental factors contribute to the development of schizophrenia.', 'A person has a 100% chance of developing schizophrenia if both of his or her parents have schizophrenia.']",

    "description": "The provided images consist of two bar graphs depicting the rates of psychiatric diagnoses among different ethnic groups admitted for psychiatric care.\n\n**Image 1:**\n- Title: Rates of schizophrenia diagnosis for individuals admitted for psychiatric care by ethnicity.\n- The x-axis represents four ethnic categories: African American, White, Hispanic American, and Asian American and other.\n- The y-axis represents the percentage rates of schizophrenia diagnosis.\n- The bars indicate the following approximate percentages:\n  - African American: 16%\n  - White: 8%\n  - Hispanic American: 15%\n  - Asian American and other: 11%\n\n**Image 2:**\n- Title: Rates of mood disorder diagnosis for individuals admitted for psychiatric care by ethnicity.\n- The x-axis also represents the same four ethnic categories: African American, White, Hispanic American, and Asian American and other.\n- The y-axis represents the percentage rates of mood disorder diagnosis.\n- The bars indicate the following approximate percentages:\n  - African American: 8%\n  - White: 16%\n  - Hispanic American: 15%\n  - Asian American and other: 11%\n\nBoth graphs use blue bars to represent the respective diagnoses (schizophrenia in Image 1 and mood disorders in Image 2). The data suggests variations in the rates of these diagnoses across different ethnic groups. \n\nThe question asks about the causes of schizophrenia based on psychological research. The images provide data on the incidence rates of schizophrenia and mood disorders among different ethnic groups but do not directly address the causes of schizophrenia. However, the data imply that schizophrenia is influenced by factors beyond genetics since the rates vary significantly among different ethnic groups. This supports the idea that environmental and other non-genetic factors play a role in the development of schizophrenia. Therefore, option D, stating that a person has a 100% chance of developing schizophrenia if both parents have it, is **NOT true** based on the understanding that genetic factors alone do not fully determine the development of schizophrenia."
