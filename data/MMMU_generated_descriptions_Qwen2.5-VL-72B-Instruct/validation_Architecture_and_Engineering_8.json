    "description": "The image provides information about three observed angles along with their respective weights:\n\n1. **Angle \u03b1**:  \n   - Value: 20\u00b010\u203210\u2033  \n   - Weight: 6  \n\n2. **Angle \u03b2**:  \n   - Value: 30\u00b020\u203230\u2033  \n   - Weight: 4  \n\n3. **Sum of Angles (\u03b1 + \u03b2)**:  \n   - Value: 50\u00b030\u203250\u2033  \n   - Weight: 2  \n\nThe task involves determining the adjusted values of \u03b1 and \u03b2 using these observations and their weights. The options provided in the question list potential adjusted values for \u03b1 and \u03b2. The correct option should match the calculated adjusted values based on the given data."
