    "description": "The image presents a table with two columns: \"Year\" and \"Cash Flows ($).\" The table lists cash flows over five years:\n\n- Year 0: $9,400 (positive cash flow)\n- Year 1: -$4,500 (negative cash flow)\n- Year 2: -$3,100 (negative cash flow)\n- Year 3: -$2,400 (negative cash flow)\n- Year 4: -$1,800 (negative cash flow)\n\nThis table represents a financial scenario where an initial positive cash inflow of $9,400 occurs at Year 0, followed by negative cash outflows in subsequent years. The values indicate the amounts to be paid out each year from Year 1 to Year 4. The question asks whether one should accept an offer involving these cash flows given a discount rate of 10%."
