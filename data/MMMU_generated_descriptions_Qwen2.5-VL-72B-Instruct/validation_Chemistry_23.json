    "question": "To spectrophotometrically determine the mass percent of cobalt in an ore containing cobalt and some inert materials, solutions with known [$Co^{2+}$] are prepared and the absorbance of each of the solutions is measured at the wavelength of optimum absorbance. The data are used to create a calibration plot, shown below. <image 1> A 0.630 g sample of the ore is completely dissolved in concentrated $HNO_3$(aq). The mixture is diluted with water to a final volume of 50.00 mL. Assume that all the cobalt in the ore sample is converted to $Co^{2+}$(aq). Calculate the number of moles of $Co^{2+}$(aq) in the 50.00 mL solution. Only write the result number, in the unit of 10^-4 mol.",

    "description": "The image shows a calibration curve for determining the concentration of \\( Co^{2+} \\) ions using spectrophotometry. The graph plots **Absorbance** (on the y-axis) against **Concentration (\\( M \\))** (on the x-axis). \n\n### Key Features of the Graph:\n- **Axes:**\n  - The x-axis represents the concentration of \\( Co^{2+} \\) in molarity (\\( M \\)), ranging from 0 to approximately 0.015 M.\n  - The y-axis represents the absorbance values, ranging from 0.00 to 0.90.\n\n- **Data Points:**\n  - There are six data points plotted on the graph, which appear to lie along a straight line. These points correspond to different concentrations of \\( Co^{2+} \\) and their respective absorbance values.\n  - The coordinates of these points are approximately:\n    - (0.000, 0.00)\n    - (0.003, 0.20)\n    - (0.005, 0.30)\n    - (0.007, 0.50)\n    - (0.010, 0.70)\n    - (0.015, 0.85)\n\n- **Trend Line:**\n  - A straight line is drawn through these points, indicating a linear relationship between absorbance and concentration. This line passes through the origin (0,0), suggesting that the relationship follows Beer-Lambert's Law.\n\n### Calibration Equation:\nFrom the graph, it is clear that the slope of the line can be calculated using any two points. Using the points (0.005, 0.30) and (0.010, 0.70):\n\\[ \\text{slope} = \\frac{0.70 - 0.30}{0.010 - 0.005} = \\frac{0.40}{0.005} = 80 \\]\n\nThus, the equation of the line is:\n\\[ \\text{Absorbance} = 80 \\times \\text{Concentration} \\]\n\nThis calibration curve will be used to determine the concentration of \\( Co^{2+} \\) in the unknown sample based on its measured absorbance."
