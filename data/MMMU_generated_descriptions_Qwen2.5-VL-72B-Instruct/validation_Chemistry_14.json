    "options": "['4', '5', '6', 'More than 6']",

    "description": "The image shows the molecular structure of morphine, a complex organic compound with the chemical formula C\u2081\u2087H\u2081\u2089NO\u2083. The structure consists of several rings interconnected, with various functional groups attached. Here's a detailed breakdown:\n\n1. **Ring System**: Morphine has a tetracyclic ring system, which includes two benzene rings fused together and two additional rings forming a complex structure.\n   \n2. **Functional Groups**:\n   - There are three hydroxyl (-OH) groups: one at the top left corner of the molecule, one at the bottom left, and one within the central ring system.\n   - A methyl group (-CH\u2083) is attached to a nitrogen atom (N), which is part of an amine group (-NHCH\u2083).\n   - An ether linkage (O) is present between two carbon atoms in the central ring system.\n\n3. **Chiral Centers**:\n   - Chiral centers are carbon atoms bonded to four different substituents. In this structure, there are five such carbon atoms:\n     - One carbon in the upper left ring adjacent to the top hydroxyl group.\n     - Two carbons in the central ring system, one near the bottom hydroxyl group and another near the ether linkage.\n     - One carbon in the lower right ring adjacent to the nitrogen-containing amine group.\n     - One carbon in the lower left ring near the bottom hydroxyl group.\n\nThus, the molecule has five chiral centers excluding the nitrogen centers."
