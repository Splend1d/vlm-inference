    "question": "<image 1> Suppose the government decided that, since gasoline is a necessity, its price should be legally capped at $1.30 per gallon. What do you anticipate would be the outcome in the gasoline market?",
    "options": "['A price below that of 1.30 dollars would cause a situation of excess demand and hence a surplus.', 'A price below that of 1.30 dollars would cause a situation of excess demand and hence a shortage.', 'Not certain.']",

    "description": "The image is a supply and demand graph for gasoline. The x-axis represents the quantity of gasoline in millions of gallons, ranging from 300 to 900 million gallons. The y-axis represents the price per gallon in dollars, ranging from $0.60 to $2.20. \n\nThere are two curves on the graph: the demand curve (D) and the supply curve (S). The demand curve slopes downward from left to right, indicating that as the price decreases, the quantity demanded increases. The supply curve slopes upward from left to right, indicating that as the price increases, the quantity supplied increases.\n\nThe point where the demand and supply curves intersect is labeled \"E,\" which represents the equilibrium price and quantity. At this point, the equilibrium price is $1.40 per gallon, and the equilibrium quantity is 600 million gallons.\n\nThe graph also shows two other scenarios:\n\n1. **Above-equilibrium price ($1.80 per gallon):** At this price, the quantity supplied exceeds the quantity demanded, resulting in an excess supply or surplus. This is indicated by the horizontal dashed line at $1.80, showing that the quantity supplied is greater than the quantity demanded.\n\n2. **Below-equilibrium price ($1.20 per gallon):** At this price, the quantity demanded exceeds the quantity supplied, resulting in an excess demand or shortage. This is indicated by the horizontal dashed line at $1.20, showing that the quantity demanded is greater than the quantity supplied.\n\nIf the government caps the price of gasoline at $1.30 per gallon, which is below the equilibrium price of $1.40, it would create a situation similar to the one described for the below-equilibrium price. In this case, the quantity demanded would exceed the quantity supplied, leading to an excess demand or shortage. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is:\n\nB. A price below that of 1.30 dollars would cause a situation of excess demand and hence a shortage."
