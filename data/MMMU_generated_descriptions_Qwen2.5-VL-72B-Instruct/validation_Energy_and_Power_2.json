    "question": "Air flows into a heat engine at ambient conditions of 100 kPa, 300 K, as shown in <image 1>. Energy is supplied as 1200 kJ per kilogram of air from a 1500 K source, and in some part of the process a heat transfer loss of 300 kJ/kg air occurs at 750 K.The air leaves the engine at 100 kPa, 800 K. Find the first- and second-law efficiencies",

    "description": "The image depicts a schematic diagram of a heat engine with various energy transfers and states labeled. Here's a detailed description:\n\n1. **Heat Engine Diagram**:\n   - The central component is a rectangular box labeled \"Heat engine.\"\n   - There are two main flow paths entering and exiting the heat engine: one at the left side (labeled as state \u2460) and one at the right side (labeled as state \u2461).\n\n2. **State \u2460 (Inlet)**:\n   - Air enters the heat engine at ambient conditions.\n   - The pressure \\( P_0 \\) is given as 100 kPa.\n   - The temperature \\( T_0 \\) is given as 300 K.\n\n3. **State \u2461 (Outlet)**:\n   - Air exits the heat engine.\n   - The pressure \\( P_0 \\) remains 100 kPa.\n   - The temperature \\( T_2 \\) is given as 800 K.\n\n4. **Energy Transfers**:\n   - Heat \\( q_H \\) is supplied to the heat engine from a high-temperature source at \\( T_H = 1500 \\) K. The value of \\( q_H \\) is 1200 kJ per kilogram of air.\n   - A heat transfer loss \\( q_{\\text{loss}} \\) occurs within the system at an intermediate temperature \\( T_M = 750 \\) K. The value of \\( q_{\\text{loss}} \\) is 300 kJ per kilogram of air.\n   - Work \\( w \\) is produced by the heat engine, but its exact value is not provided in the diagram.\n\n5. **Additional Information**:\n   - The problem specifies that the air flows into the heat engine at ambient conditions of 100 kPa and 300 K.\n   - The air leaves the engine at 100 kPa and 800 K.\n   - The task is to find the first- and second-law efficiencies of the heat engine.\n\nWith this detailed description, you should be able to solve for the first- and second-law efficiencies using thermodynamic principles and the given data."
