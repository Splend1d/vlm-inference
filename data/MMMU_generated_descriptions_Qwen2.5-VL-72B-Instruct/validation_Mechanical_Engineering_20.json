    "question": "A machine frame is made of steel having Sy = 400 MPa and Ssy = 250 MPa. When loaded in a test fixture, the stresses were found to vary linearly with load. Two points on the surface were found to be most critical. With a 4-kN test load, stresses at these points were: point a, $\\sigma $1 = 200 MPa,$\\sigma $2 = 100 MPa; point b, $\\sigma $1 = 150 MPa, $\\sigma $2 = -100 MPa. Compute the test load at which the frame will experience initial yielding according to the maximum-normal-stress theory.<image 1>",

    "description": "The image shows two points labeled \"a\" and \"b,\" each representing a location on the surface of a machine frame where stress values are measured under a test load. The stresses at these points are depicted using principal stress notation (\u03c31 and \u03c32).\n\nFor point \"a\":\n- Principal stress \u03c31 is 200 MPa.\n- Principal stress \u03c32 is 100 MPa.\n- Both stresses are shown acting in tension (arrows pointing outward from the square representing the material element).\n\nFor point \"b\":\n- Principal stress \u03c31 is 150 MPa.\n- Principal stress \u03c32 is -100 MPa.\n- Stress \u03c31 acts in tension (arrow pointing outward), while stress \u03c32 acts in compression (arrow pointing inward toward the material element).\n\nThe question provides additional information about the material properties:\n- Yield strength (Sy) is 400 MPa.\n- Shear yield strength (Ssy) is 250 MPa.\n- The stresses vary linearly with the applied load.\n- At a 4-kN test load, the given stresses occur at points \"a\" and \"b.\"\n\nThe task is to determine the test load at which the frame will initially yield according to the maximum-normal-stress theory. This theory states that yielding occurs when the maximum principal stress reaches the material's yield strength. Therefore, you need to calculate the load at which either \u03c31 or \u03c32 at points \"a\" or \"b\" equals the yield strength (400 MPa)."
