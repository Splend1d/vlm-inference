    "description": "The image shows three different voltage waveforms labeled as (a), (b), and (c). The x-axis represents time (t) in seconds, ranging from -1 to 4, while the y-axis represents voltage (v) in volts, ranging from -1 to 1.\n\n- **Waveform (a):** This waveform is a square wave with a period of 2 seconds. It alternates between +1 volt and -1 volt. Specifically:\n  - From t = -1 to t = 0, the voltage is -1 V.\n  - From t = 0 to t = 1, the voltage is +1 V.\n  - From t = 1 to t = 2, the voltage is -1 V.\n  - From t = 2 to t = 3, the voltage is +1 V.\n  - From t = 3 to t = 4, the voltage is -1 V.\n\n- **Waveform (b):** This waveform is also a square wave but shifted by half a period compared to waveform (a). It has the same amplitude (+1 V and -1 V) and period (2 seconds).\n\n- **Waveform (c):** This waveform is a triangular wave with a period of 2 seconds. It linearly increases from -1 V to +1 V over one period and then decreases back to -1 V in the next period.\n\nThe question specifically asks about the Fourier series for the voltage waveform in (a). The Fourier series for a square wave with a period T and amplitude A can be represented as:\n\n\\[ v(t) = \\frac{4A}{\\pi} \\left( \\sin(\\omega t) + \\frac{1}{3}\\sin(3\\omega t) + \\frac{1}{5}\\sin(5\\omega t) + \\ldots \\right) \\]\n\nwhere \\( \\omega = \\frac{2\\pi}{T} \\). For this waveform, A = 1 V and T = 2 s, so \\( \\omega = \\pi \\) rad/s. Therefore, the Fourier series for the waveform in (a) is:\n\n\\[ v(t) = \\frac{4}{\\pi} \\left( \\sin(\\pi t) + \\frac{1}{3}\\sin(3\\pi t) + \\frac{1}{5}\\sin(5\\pi t) + \\ldots \\right) \\]\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nB. \\( \\frac{4}{\\pi} \\left( \\sin(\\pi t) + \\frac{1}{3}\\sin(3\\pi t) + \\frac{1}{5}\\sin(5\\pi t) + \\ldots \\right) \\)"
