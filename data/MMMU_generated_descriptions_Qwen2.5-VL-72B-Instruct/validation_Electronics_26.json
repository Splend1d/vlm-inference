    "description": "The image shows an electrical circuit diagram labeled \"Fig. 1.\" The circuit consists of resistors and capacitors connected in various configurations. \n\nOn the left side of the diagram, there are three resistors with values of 2\u03a9, 4\u03a9, and 6\u03a9. These resistors are connected in a combination of series and parallel arrangements. Specifically, the 2\u03a9 and 6\u03a9 resistors are connected in series, and this series combination is then connected in parallel with the 4\u03a9 resistor.\n\nTo the right of the resistors, there are three capacitors with values of 5\u03bcF, 2\u03bcF, and 4\u03bcF. These capacitors are also connected in a combination of series and parallel arrangements. The 2\u03bcF and 4\u03bcF capacitors are connected in parallel, and this parallel combination is then connected in series with the 5\u03bcF capacitor.\n\nThe entire circuit is simplified on the right side of the diagram to show an equivalent resistance \\( R \\) and an equivalent capacitance \\( C \\). The goal is to find the value of the equivalent capacitance \\( C \\).\n\nTo solve for \\( C \\), you need to calculate the equivalent capacitance of the three capacitors (5\u03bcF, 2\u03bcF, and 4\u03bcF) using the rules for combining capacitors in series and parallel. The resistors are not relevant to finding the equivalent capacitance \\( C \\)."
