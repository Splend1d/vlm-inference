    "question": "Consider the following plasmid, pET28a, a popular expression vector that is used for protein expression in bacteria: <image 1>. You freshly purified plasmid from overnight bacterial culture using extraction kit, also known as miniprep. You confirmed the quality of plasmids by checking DNA and protein ratio (A260/280) and running them on a DNA agarose gel. They looked pure as they should be. You would now like to digest this vector for gene manipulation (molecular cloning) to generate vectors suitable for molecular cloning. If you cut the above plasmid with restriction enzyme called HindIII, the form of DNA will be changed from _________",
    "options": "['Linear to supercoiled', 'Nicked to linear', 'Nicked to supercoiled', 'Supercoiled to nicked', 'Supercoiled to linear']",

    "description": "The image provided is a circular diagram representing the structure of the pET28a plasmid, which is a commonly used expression vector for protein production in bacteria. The plasmid has a total length of 5367 base pairs (bp). Various genetic elements and features are labeled around the circle:\n\n- **KanR**: A green arc indicating the kanamycin resistance gene.\n- **f1 ori**: A yellow arrow pointing clockwise, representing the origin of replication for filamentous phage f1.\n- **T7 terminator**: A yellow box near the f1 ori, indicating the transcription termination signal for T7 RNA polymerase.\n- **lac operator**: A series of purple and gray boxes, representing the binding site for the lac repressor protein.\n- **HindIII (173)**: A label at the top of the circle, indicating the presence of a HindIII restriction enzyme recognition site at position 173 bp.\n- **6xHis**: A label near the HindIII site, indicating a sequence encoding six histidine residues for protein purification.\n- **T7 tag (gene 10 leader)**: A label near the 6xHis tag, indicating an additional protein tag derived from the T7 bacteriophage.\n- **thrombin site**: A label near the T7 tag, indicating a protease cleavage site for removing tags post-expression.\n- **RBS**: A label indicating the ribosome binding site for translation initiation.\n- **T7 promoter**: A label near the RBS, indicating the promoter recognized by T7 RNA polymerase for gene expression.\n- **lacI promoter**: A purple arrow pointing counterclockwise, representing the promoter for the lac repressor gene.\n- **lacI**: A purple arc indicating the lac repressor gene.\n- **ori**: A yellow arrow pointing clockwise, representing the origin of replication for the plasmid.\n- **bom**: A gray box, likely indicating a binding site for the Bom protein involved in plasmid partitioning.\n- **rop**: A purple arrow, indicating a gene involved in controlling plasmid copy number.\n\nThe HindIII restriction enzyme recognition site is clearly marked at position 173 bp on the plasmid. When this site is cut by the HindIII enzyme, it will create a single break in the circular DNA molecule. This action will change the form of the DNA from a supercoiled circular form to a linear form. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is:\n\n**E. Supercoiled to linear**."
