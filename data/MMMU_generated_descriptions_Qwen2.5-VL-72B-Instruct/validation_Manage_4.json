    "question": "Room registrations in the Toronto Towers Plaza Hotel have been recorded for the past 9 years. To project future occupancy, management would like to determine the mathematical trend of guest registration. This estimate will help the hotel determine whether future expansion will be needed. Given the following time-series data, develop a regression equation relating registrations to time (e.g., a trend equation). Then forecast year 11 registrations. Room registrations are in the thousands: <image 1>",
    "options": "['27010', '27020', '27030', '27040']",

    "description": "The image presents a table of room registrations at the Toronto Towers Plaza Hotel over nine years. The data is organized into two rows, with each column representing a specific year and its corresponding number of registrations in thousands:\n\n- Year 1: 17 thousand registrations\n- Year 2: 16 thousand registrations\n- Year 3: 16 thousand registrations\n- Year 4: 21 thousand registrations\n- Year 5: 20 thousand registrations\n- Year 6: 20 thousand registrations\n- Year 7: 23 thousand registrations\n- Year 8: 25 thousand registrations\n- Year 9: 24 thousand registrations\n\nThis information represents the historical trend of room registrations over the past nine years. The goal is to use this data to develop a regression equation that relates registrations to time, enabling a forecast for Year 11's registrations. The options provided for the forecasted Year 11 registrations are:\nA. 27010  \nB. 27020  \nC. 27030  \nD. 27040  \n\nThese values are in units of thousands."
