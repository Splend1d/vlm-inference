A woman, likely a teacher or instructor, is sitting with them and holding a large book titled \"Three Ninja Pigs.\" The book appears to be a storybook, and it is being read aloud to the children. The children are attentively looking at the book, suggesting they are engaged in the reading activity. The classroom environment includes pink cabinets, various educational materials, and a cozy atmosphere conducive to learning. The use of a large book, often referred to as a \"Big Book,\" is a common practice in early literacy education to facilitate shared reading experiences among young learners. This method allows for better visibility of the text and illustrations, promoting interaction and discussion among the group. The scene captures a moment of shared learning and reading, aligning with educational strategies designed to enhance literacy skills in a collaborative manner."
