    "question": "Suppose within your Web browser you click on a link to obtain a Web page. The IP address for the associated URL is not cached in your local host, so a DNS lookup is necessary to obtain the IP address. Suppose that four DNS servers are visited before your host receives the IP address from DNS. The first DNS server visited is the local DNS cache, with an RTT delay of RTT0 = 4 msecs. The second, third and fourth DNS servers contacted have RTTs of 14, 9, and 34 msecs, respectively. Initially, let's suppose that the Web page associated with the link contains exactly one object, consisting of a small amount of HTML text. Suppose the RTT between the local host and the Web server containing the object is RTTHTTP = 95 msecs. <image 1> Assuming zero transmission time for the HTML object, how much time (in msec) elapses from when the client clicks on the link until the client receives the object?Only write the number.",

    "description": "The image illustrates a network diagram involving multiple components related to DNS resolution and HTTP request processes. At the center is a router or switch depicted with a blue cross symbol. This central device connects various elements through red arrows labeled with different Round-Trip Time (RTT) values.\n\n- **Local DNS Cache**: Located at the bottom left, connected to the central device with an arrow labeled \"RTT\u2080\".\n- **Client**: Positioned at the bottom right, also connected to the central device with an arrow labeled \"RTT_HTTP\".\n- **DNS Servers**: There are three DNS servers shown, each connected to the central device with arrows labeled \"RTT\u2081\", \"RTT\u2082\", and \"RTT\u2083\" respectively.\n- **HTTP Server**: Located at the top right, connected to the central device with an arrow labeled \"RTT_HTTP\".\n\nThe RTT values represent the time it takes for a signal to travel from one point to another and back. The labels indicate the specific RTT for each connection:\n- RTT\u2080: Between the local DNS cache and the central device.\n- RTT\u2081: Between the first DNS server and the central device.\n- RTT\u2082: Between the second DNS server and the central device.\n- RTT\u2083: Between the third DNS server and the central device.\n- RTT_HTTP: Between the HTTP server and the central device.\n\nThe client initiates a request which goes through the local DNS cache, then potentially through multiple DNS servers to resolve the IP address, and finally reaches the HTTP server to retrieve the requested web page. The total time taken includes the sum of all relevant RTT delays involved in this process."
