    "description": "The image is a table listing various European countries alongside their respective dates of joining the European Union (EU). The table is divided into two columns: \"Country\" and \"Date Joined.\" Here's a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Left Column:\n- **Austria**: Joined in 1995.\n- **Belgium**: Joined in 1957.\n- **Bulgaria**: Joined in 2007.\n- **Croatia**: Joined in 2013.\n- **Cyprus**: Joined in 2004.\n- **Czech Republic**: Joined in 2004.\n- **Denmark**: Joined in 1973.\n- **Estonia**: Joined in 2004.\n- **Finland**: Joined in 1995.\n- **France**: Joined in 1957.\n- **Germany**: Joined in 1957.\n- **Greece**: Joined in 1981.\n- **Hungary**: Joined in 2004.\n- **Ireland**: Joined in 1973.\n\n### Right Column:\n- **Italy**: Joined in 1957.\n- **Latvia**: Joined in 2004.\n- **Lithuania**: Joined in 2004.\n- **Luxembourg**: Joined in 1957.\n- **Malta**: Joined in 2004.\n- **Netherlands**: Joined in 1957.\n- **Poland**: Joined in 2004.\n- **Portugal**: Joined in 1986.\n- **Romania**: Joined in 2007.\n- **Slovakia**: Joined in 2004.\n- **Slovenia**: Joined in 2004.\n- **Spain**: Joined in 1986.\n- **Sweden**: Joined in 1995.\n- **United Kingdom**: Joined in 1973.\n\n### Observations:\n- Countries like Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands joined very early, in 1957.\n- Greece, Portugal, Spain, and the United Kingdom joined later, between 1973 and 1986.\n- Several Eastern European countries, including Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia, joined significantly later, mostly in 2004 or 2007.\n\nThis data suggests that Eastern European countries were admitted much later compared to Western European countries. This delay aligns with historical events, particularly the control of Eastern Europe by the Soviet Union during the Cold War era, which ended around 1991."
