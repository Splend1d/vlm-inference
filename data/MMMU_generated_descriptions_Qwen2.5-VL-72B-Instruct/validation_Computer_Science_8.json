    "description": "The image depicts a directed graph with six vertices labeled V1 through V6. The edges between these vertices have associated capacities, which represent the maximum flow that can pass through each edge. Here's a detailed description of the connections and their capacities:\n\n- **V1** has two outgoing edges:\n  - An edge to **V2** with a capacity of 6.\n  - An edge to **V4** with a capacity of 7.\n\n- **V2** has two outgoing edges:\n  - An edge to **V3** with a capacity of 2.\n  - An edge to **V5** with a capacity of 2.\n\n- **V3** has two outgoing edges:\n  - An edge to **V4** with a capacity of 3.\n  - An edge to **V6** with a capacity of 5.\n\n- **V4** has one outgoing edge:\n  - An edge to **V6** with a capacity of 4.\n\n- **V5** has one outgoing edge:\n  - An edge to **V6** with a capacity of 4.\n\nTo find the maximum flow from V1 to V6, we need to consider all possible paths from V1 to V6 and their respective capacities. The paths and their capacities are as follows:\n\n1. **V1 -> V2 -> V5 -> V6**: The minimum capacity along this path is 2 (the smallest capacity among the edges in the path).\n2. **V1 -> V2 -> V3 -> V6**: The minimum capacity along this path is 2.\n3. **V1 -> V4 -> V6**: The capacity of this direct path is 7.\n4. **V1 -> V2 -> V3 -> V4 -> V6**: The minimum capacity along this path is 2.\n\nAdding up the capacities of the non-overlapping paths gives us the maximum flow:\n\n- Path **V1 -> V2 -> V5 -> V6**: 2 units.\n- Path **V1 -> V2 -> V3 -> V6**: 2 units.\n- Path **V1 -> V4 -> V6**: 7 units.\n\nThe total maximum flow is 2 + 2 + 7 = 11 units.\n\nTherefore, the maximum flow from V1 to V6 is **11**."
