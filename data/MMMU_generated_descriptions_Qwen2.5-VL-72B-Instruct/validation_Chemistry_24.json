    "description": "The image presents a table with two columns: temperature (T) in degrees Celsius (\u00b0C) and pressure (P) in Torr. The data points provided are as follows:\n\n- At -46.97\u00b0C, the pressure is 29.06 Torr.\n- At -41.51\u00b0C, the pressure is 42.81 Torr.\n- At -35.59\u00b0C, the pressure is 63.59 Torr.\n- At -33.14\u00b0C, the pressure is 74.31 Torr.\n- At -30.75\u00b0C, the pressure is 86.43 Torr.\n- At -27.17\u00b0C, the pressure is 107.66 Torr.\n\nThese values represent the vapor pressures of ClF\u2083 at various temperatures. To calculate the enthalpy of vaporization, one would typically use these data points in conjunction with the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, which relates the natural logarithm of the vapor pressure to the reciprocal of the absolute temperature. This relationship can be linearized and analyzed graphically or through a least squares fitting routine to determine the enthalpy of vaporization. The options for the enthalpy of vaporization provided are:\nA. 25.28 kJ/mol\nB. 20.32 kJ/mol\nC. 22.88 kJ/mol\nD. 30.58 kJ/mol."
