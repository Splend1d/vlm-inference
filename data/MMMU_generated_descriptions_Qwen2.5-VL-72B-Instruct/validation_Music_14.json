The notes are separated by a distance that spans more than an octave. Below the staff, there are four labeled options with corresponding empty boxes:\n\n1. \"compound minor 3rd\" - Box 1\n2. \"compound major 3rd\" - Box 2\n3. \"compound minor 6th\" - Box 3\n4. \"compound major 6th\" - Box 4\n\nThe task is to select the correct box that names the interval between the two notes shown on the staff."
