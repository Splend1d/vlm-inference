    "question": "In the Posterior abdominal structures, identify the 112 structure. <image 1>",
    "options": "['Oesophagus', 'Suprarenal gland', 'Hepatic flexure of colon', 'Duodenum']",

    "description": "The image is a detailed anatomical illustration of the posterior abdominal structures. Various parts of the anatomy are labeled with numbers. The focus is on the retroperitoneal space and surrounding organs. \n\n- Label **107** points to a structure that appears to be part of the vertebral column.\n- Label **108** indicates a structure that looks like the right kidney.\n- Label **109** points to what seems to be the left kidney.\n- Label **110** identifies a structure that resembles the psoas muscle.\n- Label **111** points to a structure that appears to be the inferior vena cava.\n- Label **112** is directed at a structure that is located superiorly and laterally to the inferior vena cava (111). This structure has a rounded shape and is situated near the vertebral column and the right kidney (108).\n- Label **113** points to a structure that looks like the abdominal aorta.\n\nGiven these observations, label **112** corresponds to a structure that is consistent in location and appearance with the **suprarenal gland**, which is typically found superior to the kidney and adjacent to the vertebral column. Therefore, the correct answer for the structure labeled as **112** is:\n\n**B. Suprarenal gland**."
