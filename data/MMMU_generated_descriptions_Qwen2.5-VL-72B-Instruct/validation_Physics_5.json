    "description": "The image illustrates the motion of a ball over time, with its position marked at one-second intervals. Here's a detailed breakdown:\n\n- At **0 seconds**, the ball is at **0 cm**.\n- At **1 second**, the ball is at **1 cm**.\n- At **2 seconds**, the ball is at **4 cm**.\n- At **3 seconds**, the ball is at **9 cm**.\n- At **4 seconds**, the ball is at **16 cm**.\n- At **5 seconds**, the ball is at **25 cm**.\n\nEach position is marked by a small circle, and the distances are measured in centimeters (cm). The time intervals are labeled in seconds (s).\n\nTo find the average speed of the ball between 3 and 4 seconds:\n- The position at **3 seconds** is **9 cm**.\n- The position at **4 seconds** is **16 cm**.\n- The distance traveled between 3 and 4 seconds is \\( 16 \\, \\text{cm} - 9 \\, \\text{cm} = 7 \\, \\text{cm} \\).\n- The time interval is **1 second**.\n\nThe average speed is calculated as:\n\\[ \\text{Average speed} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Time}} = \\frac{7 \\, \\text{cm}}{1 \\, \\text{s}} = 7.0 \\, \\text{cm/s} \\]\n\nThus, the correct answer is **B. 7.0 cm/s**."
