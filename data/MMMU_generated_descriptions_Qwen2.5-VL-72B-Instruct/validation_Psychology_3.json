    "description": "The image is a line graph with a shaded rectangular area in the middle. The x-axis represents three categories: \"Primacy,\" \"Intermediate,\" and \"Recency.\" The y-axis measures \"Words recalled (%)\" ranging from 0 to 100. \n\n- At the \"Primacy\" position, the percentage of words recalled starts at approximately 80%.\n- As it moves towards the \"Intermediate\" position, there is a decline in the percentage of words recalled, reaching its lowest point around 40% within the shaded area labeled \"Intermediate.\"\n- After the \"Intermediate\" section, the graph shows an increase in the percentage of words recalled as it approaches the \"Recency\" position, ending at about 75%.\n\nThe shaded rectangle highlights the \"Intermediate\" section, emphasizing the lower recall rate compared to both \"Primacy\" and \"Recency.\" This pattern suggests a higher recall for items at the beginning (\"Primacy\") and end (\"Recency\") of a list, with poorer recall for items in the middle (\"Intermediate\")."
