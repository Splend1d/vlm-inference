    "description": "The image depicts an ancient Roman portrait painted on a mummy mask, likely dating back to the 1st century AD. The portrait features a woman with a serene expression, dark hair pulled back, and large, expressive eyes. She wears a white garment draped over her head and shoulders. The painting style is characteristic of Fayum mummy portraits, which were common in Egypt during the Roman period. \n\nInscribed on the lower left side of the portrait are the words \"HERMIONE\" and \"PANMACHIA,\" written in Greek letters. These inscriptions suggest that the woman depicted is named Hermione. The portrait has a weathered appearance, with visible cracks and discoloration, indicating its age and historical significance. The artifact is part of the collection at Girton College, University of Cambridge, and was discovered in Cairo, Egypt.\n\nGiven the name \"Hermione\" inscribed on the portrait, the well-known fictional character who shares this name is Hermione Granger from the Harry Potter series. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is:\n\nC. Hermione"
