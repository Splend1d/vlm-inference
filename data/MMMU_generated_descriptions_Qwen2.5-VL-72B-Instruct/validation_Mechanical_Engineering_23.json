    "question": "Two steel plates with Sy = 50 ksi are attached by 3/8-in. parallel-loaded fillet welds, as shown in Figure. E60 series welding rods are used, and good welding practice is followed. Each of the welds is 3 in. long. With a safety factor of 3, what maximum tensile load can be applied?<image 1>",

    "description": "The image depicts two steel plates joined together using parallel-loaded fillet welds. The following details are provided:\n\n- **Material Properties**: The steel plates have a yield strength \\( S_y \\) of 50 ksi.\n- **Weld Characteristics**:\n  - **Weld Type**: Fillet welds made using E60 series welding rods.\n  - **Weld Size (Leg Length)**: \\( h = 0.375 \\) inches.\n  - **Weld Length**: Each weld is 3 inches long.\n  - **Number of Welds**: There are two separate 3-inch welds.\n- **Safety Factor**: A safety factor (SF) of 3 is specified for the design.\n- **Load Application**: The diagram shows a tensile force \\( F \\) applied to the top plate, pulling it away from the bottom plate. The distance between the plates where the force is applied is 3.0 inches.\n\nThe goal is to determine the maximum tensile load \\( F \\) that can be applied while ensuring the welds do not fail, considering the given safety factor. The options for the maximum tensile load are:\nA. 11456 lb  \nB. 14700 lb  \nC. 12457 lb  \nD. 13000 lb  \n\nTo solve this problem, one would need to calculate the allowable shear stress for the welds, taking into account the weld size, length, material properties, and the safety factor. Then, use this information to find the maximum tensile load \\( F \\) that can be applied without exceeding the allowable stress."
