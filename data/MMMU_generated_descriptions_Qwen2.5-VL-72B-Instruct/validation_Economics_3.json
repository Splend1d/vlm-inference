    "description": "The image presents a table labeled \"Table 10.7 Macroeconomic Accounts,\" which includes data for three countries denoted as A, B, and C. The table consists of four rows representing different economic variables: SH (private household saving), T (tax revenue), G (government spending), and I (investment spending). Each variable has corresponding values for countries A, B, and C, all measured in billions of currency units. \n\nHere are the specific values:\n\n- **Country A**:\n  - SH: 700\n  - T: 00 (interpreted as 0)\n  - G: 600\n  - I: 800\n\n- **Country B**:\n  - SH: 500\n  - T: 500\n  - G: 350\n  - I: 400\n\n- **Country C**:\n  - SH: 600\n  - T: 500\n  - G: 650\n  - I: 450\n\nThe task involves calculating the trade balance and the net inflow of foreign saving for each country using these provided values."
