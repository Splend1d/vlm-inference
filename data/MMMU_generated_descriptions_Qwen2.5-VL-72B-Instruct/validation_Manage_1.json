    "description": "The image illustrates the concept of bi-sociation as proposed by Arthur Koestler in 1964. It depicts a side profile of a human head with the brain sectioned into two distinct halves. On the left side of the brain, there is an image of a person sitting on a chair, while on the right side, there is a small chair depicted alongside a flower-like symbol with arrows pointing in various directions. A lightning bolt symbolizes the connection or clash between these two unrelated concepts within the brain. \n\nAdditionally, there is a small pear-shaped object near the dividing line between the two brain sections, suggesting the merging or interaction of ideas. The image visually represents the process of bringing together two separate and seemingly unrelated ideas to create something new or innovative. This visual metaphor emphasizes the importance of combining different attributes and evaluating their interactions to foster creativity. \n\nThe image does not explicitly mention defining criteria for creativity, listing attributes of unrelated concepts, evaluating combinations of properties, or looking for areas that force-fit attributes. However, it visually supports the idea of combining and interacting with unrelated concepts, which aligns with options B, C, and D from the question. Therefore, option A, \"Defining the criteria for creativity,\" is not directly represented in the image and may not be part of the concept of dual association suggested by Berk (2013)."
