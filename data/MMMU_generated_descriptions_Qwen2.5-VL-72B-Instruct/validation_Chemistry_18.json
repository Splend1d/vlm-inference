    "question": "An experiment is performed to measure the mass percent of $CaCO_3$(s) in eggshells. Five different samples of $CaCO_3$(s) of known mass react with an excess of 2.0 M $HCl$(aq) in identical sealed, rigid reaction vessels. The pressure of the gas produced is measured with a pressure gauge attached to the reaction vessel. Since the reaction is exothermic, the reaction system is cooled to its original temperature before the pressure is recorded. The experimental data are used to create the calibration line below. <image 1> The experiment is repeated with an eggshell sample, and the experimental data are recorded in the table below. <image 2> Which of the following modifications will increase the rate of the reaction the most? ",
    "options": "['Using 2.0 M $CH_3COOH$(aq) instead of 2.0 M $HCl$(aq) ', 'Cooling the $HCl$(aq) to a lower temperature than it was in the original experiment', 'Reducing the volume of the reaction vessel', 'Using eggshells that are more finely powdered than those used in the original experiment ']",

    "description": "The first image is a graph titled \"Pressure of Gas Produced (atm)\" versus \"Mass of CaCO\u2083(s) (grams).\" The x-axis represents the mass of calcium carbonate (CaCO\u2083) in grams, ranging from 0.05 to 0.20 grams. The y-axis represents the pressure of the gas produced in atmospheres (atm), ranging from 0.02 atm to 0.10 atm. The graph shows a linear relationship between the mass of CaCO\u2083 and the pressure of the gas produced. Data points are plotted at various masses of CaCO\u2083: approximately 0.06 g, 0.10 g, 0.14 g, 0.18 g, and 0.20 g, with corresponding pressures around 0.03 atm, 0.05 atm, 0.07 atm, 0.09 atm, and 0.10 atm respectively. A straight line connects these points, indicating a direct proportionality between the mass of CaCO\u2083 and the pressure of the gas produced.\n\nThe second image is a table containing experimental data for an eggshell sample. The table includes three rows:\n1. Mass of eggshell sample: 0.200 grams.\n2. Pressure prior to reaction: 0.800 atm.\n3. Pressure at completion of reaction: 0.870 atm.\n\nThis information indicates that when the eggshell sample reacts, the pressure increases by 0.070 atm (from 0.800 atm to 0.870 atm). This change in pressure can be used in conjunction with the calibration line from the first image to determine the mass of CaCO\u2083 in the eggshell sample. \n\nTo address the question about increasing the reaction rate, the provided images do not directly provide information about reaction rates or conditions affecting them. However, the context suggests that modifying factors like concentration, temperature, surface area, or volume could influence the reaction rate. The options given involve changing the acid type, cooling the acid, reducing the reaction vessel volume, or using more finely powdered eggshells."
