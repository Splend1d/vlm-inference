    "description": "The image depicts a schematic representation of a thin film interference setup. The diagram shows a monochromatic beam of light incident normally (perpendicularly) onto a thin film. The thin film has an index of refraction denoted as \\( n_f \\). Above the thin film, there is a medium with an index of refraction \\( n_1 \\), and below the thin film, there is another medium with an index of refraction \\( n_2 \\). The relationships between these indices of refraction are given as \\( n_1 < n_f \\) and \\( n_2 < n_f \\).\n\nThe light beam travels through the thin film and reflects off both the top and bottom interfaces of the film. The question asks about the condition for maximum constructive interference between the incident beam and the reflected beam, given that the wavelength of the light within the film is \\( \\lambda \\). The options provided for the film thickness are:\n\nA. \\( 2\\lambda \\)\nB. \\( \\lambda \\)\nC. \\( \\lambda / 2 \\)\nD. \\( \\lambda / 4 \\)\n\nTo determine the correct film thickness for maximum constructive interference, one would consider the phase changes upon reflection at the interfaces and the path difference traveled by the light within the film. Since \\( n_1 < n_f \\) and \\( n_2 < n_f \\), there will be a phase change of \\( \\pi \\) (or half a wavelength) upon reflection at both interfaces. This phase change must be accounted for in determining the conditions for constructive interference."
