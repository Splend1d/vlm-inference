    "description": "The image shows a modernist chair with a distinct geometric design. The chair features a rectangular backrest in bright red, a seat in deep blue, and armrests in dark brown with yellow accents at the ends. The frame of the chair is constructed from dark wood or metal, with a grid-like structure that includes horizontal and vertical elements. The joints between the wooden or metallic pieces are highlighted with small yellow blocks. The overall aesthetic is minimalist and abstract, with a strong emphasis on primary colors and straight lines. This style is characteristic of the De Stijl art movement, which originated in the Netherlands. The chair is known as the \"Red and Blue Chair,\" designed by Gerrit Rietveld, a Dutch architect and furniture designer. The design reflects the principles of the De Stijl movement, which was founded by Dutch artists and architects. Therefore, the designer of the chair is Dutch."
