    "question": "The <image 1> shows a typical innovation model. As innovation adds more functions, which of the following options is not a result of it?",
    "options": "['Achieve performance levels required by the market', 'This product has ongoing sales value', 'Customers are overserved', 'Customers receive additional value']",
    "id": "validation_Manage_7",
    "description": "The image is a graph titled \"Figure 2.24 Sustaining versus disruptive innovation.\" The x-axis represents \"TIME,\" while the y-axis represents \"PRODUCT PERFORMANCE.\" There are two main lines in the graph:\n\n1. **Progress due to sustaining technologies:** This line starts at a lower performance level and gradually increases over time. It is labeled as \"Performance demanded at the low end of the market\" at its starting point and continues upward, indicating an improvement in performance over time. This line represents innovations that enhance existing products and meet the needs of current customers.\n\n2. **Disruptive technological innovation:** This line starts below the \"progress due to sustaining technologies\" line but at a later point in time. It then rises steeply, surpassing the performance level of the sustaining technologies line. This line is labeled as \"Performance demanded at the high end of the market\" at its endpoint, suggesting that disruptive innovations initially serve simpler, less demanding markets but eventually outperform established offerings.\n\nThe graph illustrates how sustaining technologies improve over time to meet the demands of the market, while disruptive innovations start with lower performance but rapidly improve and eventually exceed the performance of sustaining technologies. The graph also highlights that as sustaining technologies continue to improve, they may overshoot the performance demanded by the market, leading to a situation where customers are \"overserved.\"\n\nBased on this description, the option that is not a result of innovation adding more functions is:\n\n**B. This product has ongoing sales value**\n\nThis is because the graph suggests that as sustaining technologies continue to improve, they may overshoot the performance demanded by the market, potentially leading to a decline in sales value if the added functions do not provide additional value to the customers."
