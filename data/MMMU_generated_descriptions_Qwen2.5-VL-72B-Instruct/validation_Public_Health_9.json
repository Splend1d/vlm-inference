    "question": "A maternal and child health facility wanted to evaluate the effectiveness of two methods of screening for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN I-III), electronic colposcopy and cervical liquid-based cytology (TCT). 600 gynaecological outpatient cases were examined by both methods, and all cases were confirmed with cervical histopathology (the gold standard) at the same time. The results of all examinations were summarised in the table.<image 1> The specificity of electronic colposcopy was",

    "description": "The provided table summarizes the test results from two screening methods\u2014electronic colposcopy and ThinPrep Cytology Test (TCT)\u2014for detecting cervical lesions among 600 gynecological outpatient cases. All cases were confirmed using cervical histopathology as the gold standard. The table categorizes patients into those with cervical lesions and those with non-cervical lesions, and it shows the outcomes of the two tests (+ or -) for each group:\n\n### Patients with Cervical Lesions:\n- **Electronic Colposcopy Positive (EC+), TCT Negative (TCT-):** 15 patients.\n- **Electronic Colposcopy Negative (EC-), TCT Positive (TCT+):** 5 patients.\n- **Both Electronic Colposcopy and TCT Positive (EC+, TCT+):** 70 patients.\n- **Both Electronic Colposcopy and TCT Negative (EC-, TCT-):** 10 patients.\n- **Total:** 100 patients with cervical lesions.\n\n### Patients with Non-Cervical Lesions:\n- **Electronic Colposcopy Positive (EC+), TCT Negative (TCT-):** 10 patients.\n- **Electronic Colposcopy Negative (EC-), TCT Positive (TCT+):** 220 patients.\n- **Both Electronic Colposcopy and TCT Positive (EC+, TCT+):** 25 patients.\n- **Both Electronic Colposcopy and TCT Negative (EC-, TCT-):** 245 patients.\n- **Total:** 500 patients with non-cervical lesions.\n\n### Specificity Calculation:\nSpecificity refers to the proportion of true negatives (correctly identified non-cervical lesion cases) out of all negative cases. For electronic colposcopy, this would be calculated as follows:\n\n- True Negatives (TN): Cases where EC- and confirmed non-cervical lesions = 245.\n- False Positives (FP): Cases where EC+ but confirmed non-cervical lesions = 10 + 25 = 35.\n\nSpecificity = TN / (TN + FP)  \n= 245 / (245 + 35)  \n= 245 / 280  \n\u2248 0.875  \n\nHowever, since the question asks for the closest option, the correct answer is **A. 0.93**, which is the closest value to the calculated specificity."
