    "question": "Individuals diagnosed with cancer often experience significant amounts of stress. Some patients cope with stress by adopting unhealthy habits (like drinking, smoking, or withdrawing from social relationships), which can increase symptom severity and result in poor quality of life both during and after cancer treatment. Conversely, individuals who manage stress with healthy techniques can experience symptom relief and improved quality of life. A group of oncologists hope to promote healthy stress reduction and decide to focus their efforts on deep breathing. They postulate that a deep breathing exercise will induce the relaxation response, a physical state of deep rest that is the physiological opposite of a stress response (or fight or flight). They believe that when patients learn to breathe more slowly and deeply, their muscles will relax, blood pressure will decrease, and heart rates will slow down (all characteristics of the relaxation response). When testing the exercise with two patients they notice significant decreases in blood pressure, muscle tension, and heart rate. They conclude that the exercise could decrease select physical symptoms of stress. The oncologists decide to expand their testing, and develop several deep-breathing exercises to be delivered in a group format. They believe that the combined exercises will help patients cope during times of stress. The program consists of 30-minute guided group breathing classes that occur biweekly for 8 weeks. Patients are also asked to complete home deep breathing practices. To test their theory, they recruit 10 adult cancer patients to participate in their program. The patient group is homogenous in type and stage of cancer. All patients have recently received their cancer diagnosis. The patients are all between 45 and 55 years old (mean age 48.6) and there are equal numbers of men and women in the group. Each patient completes a stress symptom checklist both before and after the intervention. The stress symptoms checklist can be found in Table 1. The symptom checklist is divided into four categories, with six possible symptoms in each category. Patients are instructed to circle any and all symptoms they are currently experiencing. The results from the study can be found in Figure 1 <image 1>. Which coping strategy best describes the deep breathing program?",
    "options": "[\"Appraisal focused coping because it challenges patient's assumptions about cancer and relaxation.\", 'Emotion focused coping because it teaches patients to manage emotions that accompany perception of stress.', 'Problem focused coping because the program is aimed at learning more about stress and taking control.', 'Avoidance focused coping because patients distance themselves from their physiological reaction to stressful experiences.']",

    "description": "The image contains two main components: **Table 1** and **Figure 1**.\n\n### Table 1:\nThis table categorizes various stress-related symptoms into four domains: **Emotional**, **Physical**, **Cognitive**, and **Behavioral**. Each domain lists six specific symptoms:\n\n- **Emotional**: Frustration, Moodiness, Agitation, Feeling overwhelmed, Low self-esteem, Loneliness or Isolation.\n- **Physical**: Decreased energy, Headaches, Diarrhea, constipation, or general stomach upset, Chest pain, rapid heartbeat, Loss of sex drive, Frequent colds.\n- **Cognitive**: Frequent anxiety or worry, Poor concentration, Forgetfulness, Inability to focus or concentrate, Negativity, Poor judgment.\n- **Behavioral**: Changes in appetite, Changes in sleep, Procrastination, Nervous habits (nail biting or fidgeting), Increased substance use or abuse, Isolation from others.\n\n### Figure 1:\nThis figure is a bar graph comparing the mean number of symptoms reported by participants **before** (\"Pre Intervention\") and **after** (\"Post Intervention\") the deep breathing program. The x-axis represents the four symptom categories (Emotional, Cognitive, Behavioral, Physical), while the y-axis shows the mean number of symptoms reported, ranging from 0 to 7.\n\nKey observations from the graph:\n- For all four categories, the mean number of symptoms reported is higher before the intervention compared to after the intervention.\n- The most significant reduction appears in the **Emotional** category, where the pre-intervention mean is approximately 6, and the post-intervention mean drops to around 2.\n- The other three categories (Cognitive, Behavioral, Physical) also show reductions, but these are less pronounced than in the Emotional category. For example, the Cognitive category has a pre-intervention mean of about 6 and a post-intervention mean of roughly 3.\n\n### Summary:\nThe deep breathing program appears to have had the most substantial impact on emotional symptoms, followed by cognitive, behavioral, and physical symptoms. This suggests that the program may primarily address emotional responses to stress, which aligns with emotion-focused coping strategies."
