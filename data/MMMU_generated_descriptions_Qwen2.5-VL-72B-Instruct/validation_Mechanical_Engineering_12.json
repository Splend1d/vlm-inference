    "description": "The image shows an object with two views: a front view and a top view. The front view depicts a cylindrical shape with a flat rectangular section extending from its right side. The top view shows a circular cross-section aligned with the rectangular extension.\n\nBelow these views, there are four options labeled a), b), c), and d), each showing a different left-side view of the object:\n\n- **a)** Shows a rectangular shape with a small protrusion on the left side.\n- **b)** Displays a T-shaped figure where the horizontal line is longer than the vertical one.\n- **c)** Illustrates a U-shaped figure with a vertical line on the left and a horizontal line at the bottom.\n- **d)** Depicts a similar T-shape to option b) but with a smaller horizontal line compared to the vertical one.\n\nThe correct left view should match the dimensions and proportions seen in the front and top views. Based on this, the correct answer is **D**."
