    "description": "The image illustrates an \"Information Orientation\" framework, which is divided into three main categories, each representing a distinct information function. These categories are:\n\n1. **Information Technology (IT) Practices Capability**: This category includes four specific capabilities:\n   - IT for Management Support\n   - IT for Innovation Support\n   - IT for Business Process Support\n   - IT for Operational Support\n\n2. **Information Management Practices Capability**: This category encompasses five capabilities:\n   - Sensing\n   - Processing\n   - Maintaining\n   - Organizing\n   - Collecting\n\n3. **Information Behaviors and Values Capability**: This category lists six capabilities:\n   - Proactiveness\n   - Sharing\n   - Transparency\n   - Control\n   - Formality\n   - Integrity\n\nEach of these categories contributes to the overall concept of Information Orientation, with a total of 15 capabilities across the three functions. The image does not explicitly mention \"Information collection and integration\" as a standalone capability but rather includes \"Collecting\" under the Information Management Practices Capability. Therefore, the option \"Information collection and integration\" is not directly listed as one of the 15 capabilities in the image."
