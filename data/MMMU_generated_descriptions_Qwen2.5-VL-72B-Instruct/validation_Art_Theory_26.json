    "description": "The image shows a modernist chair with a geometric design. The chair features a frame constructed from dark-colored rectangular wooden beams. These beams form the legs, armrests, and back support of the chair. The seat and backrest panels are flat and appear to be made of solid sheets in primary colors: the seat is blue, the backrest is red, and there are yellow accents at the joints where the wooden beams meet. The overall structure suggests a sturdy build typical of furniture made from wood or a wood-like material. The chair is placed on a wooden floor against a plain wall, which further emphasizes its clean lines and bold color contrasts. \n\nBased on this description, the chair is most likely made of **D. plywood**, as it combines the structural integrity needed for the frame with the ability to create smooth, flat panels for the seat and backrest. Plywood is a common material used in modernist furniture designs like this one."
