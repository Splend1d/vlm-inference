    "description": "The image depicts a vast landscape dominated by a mountainous region with significant snow cover. The mountains have rugged, rocky surfaces with patches of snow clinging to their slopes, indicating cold temperatures. The foreground consists of flat, open terrain with sparse vegetation, primarily low-lying grasses and shrubs. There are no tall trees or dense forests visible; instead, the area appears barren and desolate, typical of regions with harsh climates. The sky is clear and blue, suggesting a dry atmosphere. The overall scene lacks the lush greenery associated with rainforests and the dense coniferous trees characteristic of taigas. The environment does not exhibit the arid conditions typically found in deserts. \n\nBased on this description, the biome shown in the image is most consistent with:\n\nB. tundra"
