    "question": "A W 8 X 28 beam of a length 10 ft is held between immoveable supports. The beam has a modulus of elasticity E = 29,000 ksi and coefficient of thermal expansion $\\alpha=6.5\\times10^{-6}/^\\circF$ . If the temperature of the beam is raised uniformly by an amount $\\Delta T=20^\\circF$ , calculate the thermal stress $\\sigma_{T}$ in the beam.<image 1>",

    "description": "The image depicts a beam labeled \"A\" at one end and \"B\" at the other, with a length denoted as \\( L \\). The beam is subjected to a uniform temperature change \\( \\Delta T \\), which is indicated between points A and B. The beam is restrained by immovable supports at both ends, represented by symbols \\( R_A \\) and \\( R_B \\), suggesting that the beam cannot expand or contract freely due to the temperature change.\n\nThe beam's cross-section is shown as a rectangular shape, and it is shaded light blue for clarity. The red arrows pointing towards each other from \\( R_A \\) and \\( R_B \\) indicate the restraining forces applied by the supports, preventing the beam from expanding due to the temperature increase.\n\nThe given parameters for the beam include:\n- Length \\( L = 10 \\) ft.\n- Modulus of elasticity \\( E = 29,000 \\) ksi.\n- Coefficient of thermal expansion \\( \\alpha = 6.5 \\times 10^{-6} / ^\\circ F \\).\n- Temperature change \\( \\Delta T = 20^\\circ F \\).\n\nThe question asks for the calculation of the thermal stress \\( \\sigma_T \\) in the beam under these conditions. The options provided for the thermal stress are:\nA. -2.77 ksi\nB. -3.77 ksi\nC. -4.77 ksi\n\nThe negative sign indicates compressive stress, which is expected since the beam is restrained from expanding."
