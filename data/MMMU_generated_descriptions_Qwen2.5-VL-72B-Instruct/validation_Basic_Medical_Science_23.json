    "description": "The image shows a blood smear under a microscope. The central focus is a large cell with a kidney-shaped or horseshoe-shaped nucleus that appears to be slightly indented but not segmented. The cytoplasm surrounding the nucleus is abundant and has a light blue color with some visible granules. There are also several smaller cells around it, which appear to be red blood cells, identifiable by their round shape and lack of nuclei. The overall appearance of the central cell suggests it is a type of white blood cell with specific characteristics."
