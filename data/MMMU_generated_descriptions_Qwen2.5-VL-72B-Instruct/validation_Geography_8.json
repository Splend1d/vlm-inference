    "question": "The storage height of a small homogeneous earth dam is 16m, and the flow network is shown in Figure 1-5. The interval of the water head gradient equipotential lines in the flow network is evenly divided into m=22 (the number of equipotential lines calculated from downstream is shown in the figure). The G point in the earth dam is located on the 20th equipotential line, 11.5m above the ground level. May I ask which of the following options is the closest to the pore water pressure at point G?

    "description": "The image depicts a cross-sectional view of a small homogeneous earth dam with a storage height of 16 meters. A flow net diagram is overlaid on this cross-section, illustrating the distribution of equipotential lines and streamlines within the dam structure. The equipotential lines represent constant hydraulic potential, while the streamlines indicate the paths of water flow through the dam.\n\nKey details from the image:\n\n1. **Storage Height**: The total storage height of the dam is 16 meters.\n2. **Flow Net**: The flow net is evenly divided into 22 equipotential lines, starting from the downstream side. These lines are numbered sequentially from 1 to 22, with the first line being closest to the downstream end.\n3. **Point G**: Point G is specifically marked on the 20th equipotential line. This means it is located near the upstream side of the dam but still within the flow net area.\n4. **Elevation of Point G**: Point G is situated 11.5 meters above the ground level.\n5. **Hydraulic Head Distribution**: The hydraulic head decreases linearly from the upstream to the downstream side. The topmost equipotential line represents the highest hydraulic head, equal to the storage height (16 meters), while the bottommost line represents zero hydraulic head at the downstream end.\n\nTo determine the pore water pressure at point G:\n- The hydraulic head at point G can be calculated by considering its position on the 20th equipotential line out of 22. Since the head is evenly distributed, each equipotential line represents a decrease in head by \\( \\frac{16}{22} \\) meters.\n- Therefore, the hydraulic head at point G is \\( 16 - \\left( \\frac{16}{22} \\times 19 \\right) \\approx 1.45 \\) meters.\n- The pore water pressure at point G is given by \\( \\gamma_w \\times h \\), where \\( \\gamma_w \\) is the unit weight of water (approximately 9.81 kN/m\u00b3) and \\( h \\) is the hydraulic head at point G.\n- Thus, the pore water pressure at point G is approximately \\( 9.81 \\times 1.45 \\approx 14.2 \\) kPa.\n\nGiven the options provided, the closest value to the calculated pore water pressure is:\n\n**A. 30 kPa**  \n**B. 45 kPa**  \n**C. 115 kPa**  \n**D. 145 kPa**\n\nThe correct answer is **D. 145 kPa**."
