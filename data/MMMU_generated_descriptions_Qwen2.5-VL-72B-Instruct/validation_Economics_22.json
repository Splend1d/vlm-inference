    "description": "The image consists of two graphs connected by an arrow indicating a sequence of events.\n\n**Graph 1 (Left):**\n- **Axes:** The vertical axis represents \"Interest rates (r),\" and the horizontal axis represents \"Money.\"\n- **Curves:**\n  - A downward-sloping line labeled \"Demand,\" which shows the relationship between interest rates and the demand for money. As interest rates decrease, the demand for money increases.\n  - A vertical line labeled \"Supply,\" which indicates that the supply of money is fixed at a certain level regardless of the interest rate.\n- **Arrow:** An arrow points from this graph to the next one, suggesting a transition or consequence of the depicted scenario.\n\n**Graph 2 (Right):**\n- **Axes:** The vertical axis represents \"Price level (PL),\" and the horizontal axis represents \"GDP.\"\n- **Curves:**\n  - An upward-sloping line labeled \"Aggregate supply,\" which shows that as the price level increases, the quantity of goods and services supplied also increases.\n  - A downward-sloping line labeled \"Aggregate demand,\" which shows that as the price level increases, the quantity of goods and services demanded decreases.\n- **Intersection:** The two lines intersect at a point, indicating equilibrium in the economy where aggregate supply equals aggregate demand.\n\n**Connection Between Graphs:**\n- The arrow connecting the two graphs suggests that an increase in the money supply (a shift in the supply curve to the right in Graph 1) leads to a change in the economy depicted in Graph 2. Specifically, it implies that an increase in the money supply will lower interest rates, stimulating borrowing and spending, which in turn shifts the aggregate demand curve to the right in Graph 2. This results in both a higher GDP and a higher price level at the new equilibrium point. \n\nThus, the correct answer to the question is:\nB. GDP and the price level rise."
