    "question": "Among the following binary trees, which one may become a binary search decision tree (excluding external nodes)",
    "options": "['<image 1>', '<image 2>', '<image 3>', '<image 4>']",
    "id": "validation_Computer_Science_11",
    "description": "The provided images depict four different binary trees, each consisting of internal nodes connected by edges. Here's a detailed description of each tree:\n\n**Tree A:**\n- The root node has two children.\n- The left child of the root has two children.\n- The right child of the root has two children.\n- The left child of the left child of the root has two children.\n- The right child of the left child of the root has no children.\n- Both children of the right child of the root have no children.\n\n**Tree B:**\n- The root node has two children.\n- The left child of the root has two children.\n- The right child of the root has two children.\n- The left child of the left child of the root has two children.\n- The right child of the left child of the root has two children.\n- Both children of the right child of the root have no children.\n\n**Tree C:**\n- The root node has two children.\n- The left child of the root has two children.\n- The right child of the root has two children.\n- The left child of the left child of the root has two children.\n- The right child of the left child of the root has no children.\n- The left child of the right child of the root has no children.\n- The right child of the right child of the root has no children.\n\n**Tree D:**\n- The root node has two children.\n- The left child of the root has two children.\n- The right child of the root has two children.\n- The left child of the left child of the root has two children.\n- The right child of the left child of the root has no children.\n- The left child of the right child of the root has no children.\n- The right child of the right child of the root has no children.\n\nEach tree is structured with internal nodes and does not include external nodes in the depiction. The structure of these trees will determine their suitability for becoming a binary search decision tree."
