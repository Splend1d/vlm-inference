    "description": "The image presents a probability distribution for a discrete random variable \\( q \\). The table lists the values of \\( q \\) along with their corresponding probabilities:\n\n- When \\( q = 0 \\), the probability is \\( 0.25 \\).\n- When \\( q = 1 \\), the probability is \\( 0.25 \\).\n- When \\( q = 2 \\), the probability is \\( 0.50 \\).\n\nThis information is sufficient to calculate the standard deviation of the random variable \\( q \\)."
