    "options": "['<image 1>', '<image 2>', '<image 3>', '<image 4>']",
    "id": "validation_Music_16",
    "description": "The images depict various musical rest symbols with different durations:\n\n- **Image A**: Shows a series of rests, each followed by a single dot. These represent dotted rests, where the duration of each rest is increased by half its original value.\n  \n- **Image B**: Displays a rest symbol followed by two dots. This represents a double-dotted rest, where the duration of the rest is increased by half its original value plus a quarter of its original value, making it a compound dotted duration.\n  \n- **Image C**: Contains a rest symbol followed by a single dot, similar to those in Image A. This also represents a dotted rest with an increased duration by half its original value.\n  \n- **Image D**: Shows a rest symbol without any dots. This is a standard rest with no additional increase in duration.\n\nBased on these descriptions, the rest that does not have a compound dotted duration is the one in **Image D**, as it has no dots at all. Images A, B, and C all have dotted or double-dotted durations."
