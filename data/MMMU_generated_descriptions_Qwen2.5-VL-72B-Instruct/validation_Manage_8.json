    "description": "The image is a line graph titled \"Number Unemployed, by Level of Education.\" The x-axis represents months from June to October, while the y-axis represents the number of unemployed workers in thousands. There are four lines on the graph, each representing a different level of education:\n\n1. **Less than a high school diploma**: This line starts at approximately 12.5 thousand in June, dips slightly to around 12 thousand in July, then decreases further to about 11.5 thousand in August, rises slightly to around 11.8 thousand in September, and ends at roughly 12 thousand in October.\n   \n2. **High school diploma, no college**: This line begins at approximately 8.5 thousand in June, increases slightly to around 9 thousand in July, remains relatively stable at about 9 thousand in August, dips slightly to around 8.8 thousand in September, and ends at approximately 8.7 thousand in October.\n   \n3. **Some college**: This line starts at approximately 7.5 thousand in June, decreases to around 7 thousand in July, continues to decline to about 6.5 thousand in August, remains steady at around 6.5 thousand in September, and rises slightly to approximately 6.8 thousand in October.\n   \n4. **Bachelor's degree and higher**: This line begins at approximately 4 thousand in June, remains stable at around 4 thousand through July and August, dips slightly to about 3.8 thousand in September, and ends at approximately 3.7 thousand in October.\n\nTo determine when the difference between the number of unemployed high school graduates and those without a high school diploma was smallest, we need to compare the values for these two groups across the months. \n\n- In June: The difference is approximately 12.5 - 8.5 = 4 thousand.\n- In July: The difference is approximately 12 - 9 = 3 thousand.\n- In August: The difference is approximately 11.5 - 9 = 2.5 thousand.\n- In September: The difference is approximately 11.8 - 8.8 = 3 thousand.\n- In October: The difference is approximately 12 - 8.7 = 3.3 thousand.\n\nThe smallest difference occurs in August, with a difference of 2.5 thousand. Therefore, the correct answer is C. August."
