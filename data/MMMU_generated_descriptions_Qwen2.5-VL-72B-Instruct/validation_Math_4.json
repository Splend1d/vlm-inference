    "description": "The image shows a graph of a trigonometric function plotted on a Cartesian coordinate system with labeled axes. The x-axis ranges from -4 to 4, and the y-axis ranges from -5 to 5. The graph appears to be a sine wave, oscillating between -1 and 1 on the y-axis. \n\nKey observations:\n- The amplitude of the wave is 1.\n- The wave completes one full cycle (from peak to peak or trough to trough) over an interval of 1 unit on the x-axis.\n- The wave starts at the origin (0,0), which is characteristic of the sine function.\n- There are no phase shifts or vertical shifts; the wave is centered around the x-axis.\n\nGiven these characteristics, the equation of the graph is likely to be in the form \\( y = \\sin(bx) \\), where \\( b \\) determines the period of the sine wave. Since the wave completes one full cycle over an interval of 1 unit on the x-axis, the period \\( T \\) is 1. The relationship between the period and the coefficient \\( b \\) in the sine function is given by \\( T = \\frac{2\\pi}{b} \\). Therefore, \\( b = 2\\pi \\).\n\nThus, the equation of the graph is \\( y = \\sin(2\\pi x) \\).\n\nSo, the correct option is B. \\( y = \\sin(2\\pi x) \\)."
