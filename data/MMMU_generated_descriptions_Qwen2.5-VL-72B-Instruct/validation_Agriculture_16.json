    "description": "The image shows a close-up view of a leaf with visible signs of disease or damage. The leaf is predominantly green but has distinct areas where the tissue appears discolored. There are two prominent brown spots on the leaf, which seem to be sites of infection or damage. Surrounding these brown spots, there is a noticeable yellowish area. This yellow area is not uniformly spread across the leaf but is specifically located around the brown spots, creating a clear boundary between the healthy green tissue and the infected brown areas. The yellow area appears to be a response to the infection, possibly indicating a defensive reaction by the plant. The soil and other leaves in the background are also visible, but they are not the focus of the image. The yellow area surrounding the infection sites is distinct and separate from the rest of the leaf's coloration."
