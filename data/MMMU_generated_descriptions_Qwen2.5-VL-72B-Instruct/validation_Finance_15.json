    "description": "The image presents a table comparing the cash flows for two projects, labeled \"Project A\" and \"Project B.\" The table includes five rows representing different time periods (C\u2080 through C\u2084) and their corresponding cash flow values for each project:\n\n- **C\u2080**: Both projects have an initial outlay of -\\$200.\n- **C\u2081**: Project A has a cash inflow of \\$80, while Project B has a cash inflow of \\$100.\n- **C\u2082**: Project A again has a cash inflow of \\$80, and Project B has a cash inflow of \\$100.\n- **C\u2083**: Project A has a cash inflow of \\$80, and Project B has a cash inflow of \\$100.\n- **C\u2084**: Project A has a cash inflow of \\$80, whereas Project B does not have any cash inflow in this period.\n\nThis information is sufficient to calculate the internal rate of return (IRR) for both projects using financial formulas or tools designed for IRR calculations."
