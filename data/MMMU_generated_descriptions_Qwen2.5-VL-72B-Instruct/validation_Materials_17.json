    "question": "When the hand is holding the 5-lb stone, the humerus H, assumed to be smooth, exerts normal forces F_C and F_A on the radius C and ulna A, respectively, as shown. If the smallest crosssectional area of the ligament at B is 0.30 in^2, determine the greatest average tensile stress to which it is subjected. <image 1>",

    "description": "The image depicts a biomechanical diagram of a human forearm holding a weight (a 5-lb stone). The arm is shown in a side view with the elbow bent at approximately 75 degrees. Key anatomical structures and forces acting on them are labeled:\n\n- **H**: Represents the humerus bone.\n- **C**: Represents the radius bone.\n- **A**: Represents the ulna bone.\n- **G**: Represents the 5-lb stone held in the hand.\n- **F_B**: Represents the force exerted by the biceps muscle, which acts at an angle of 75 degrees relative to the horizontal.\n- **F_C**: Represents the normal force exerted by the humerus on the radius.\n- **F_A**: Represents the normal force exerted by the humerus on the ulna.\n\nThe distances between key points are also provided:\n- The distance from the elbow joint to the point where the biceps force \\( F_B \\) acts is 2 inches.\n- The distance from the elbow joint to the point where the weight \\( G \\) is applied is 14 inches.\n- The distance from the elbow joint to the point where \\( F_C \\) acts is 0.8 inches.\n\nAdditionally, the smallest cross-sectional area of the ligament at point \\( B \\) is given as 0.30 square inches.\n\nTo solve for the greatest average tensile stress in the ligament at \\( B \\), you need to calculate the force \\( F_B \\) using the principle of moments about the elbow joint. Then, use the formula for stress (\\( \\sigma = \\frac{F}{A} \\)), where \\( F \\) is the force and \\( A \\) is the cross-sectional area of the ligament. \n\nGiven the provided dimensions and the weight of the stone, you can determine the required force \\( F_B \\) and subsequently the stress in the ligament. The correct answer among the options provided is 121 psi."
