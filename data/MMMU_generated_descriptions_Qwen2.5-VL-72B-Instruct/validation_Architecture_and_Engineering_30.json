    "description": "The image depicts a composite geometric shape labeled as \"Fig. 1.\" The shape consists of two distinct sections:\n\n1. **Rectangular Section:**\n   - The left portion of the figure is a rectangle.\n   - The width of the rectangle is denoted by \\( b \\).\n   - The height of the rectangle is denoted by \\( a \\).\n\n2. **Triangular Section:**\n   - The right portion of the figure is a right triangle.\n   - The base of the triangle is also \\( a \\), matching the height of the rectangle.\n   - The height of the triangle is the same as the height of the rectangle, which is \\( a \\).\n\n3. **Circular Hole:**\n   - Inside the rectangular section, there is a circular hole.\n   - The radius of the hole is denoted by \\( r \\).\n\nThe dimensions provided in the question are:\n- \\( a = 50.30 \\pm 0.01 \\) meters,\n- \\( b = 82.65 \\pm 0.03 \\) meters,\n- \\( r = 9.50 \\pm 0.02 \\) meters.\n\nAdditionally, it is mentioned that the measurements were taken using a 30-meter tape standardized at 30\u00b0C, while the field temperature during measurement was 50\u00b0C. The coefficient of linear expansion is given as \\( 1.15 \\times 10^{-5} \\) per \u00b0C.\n\nTo compute the area of the composite shape, you need to calculate the area of the rectangle, the area of the triangle, subtract the area of the circular hole, and then account for the thermal expansion correction due to the temperature difference. The error in the area and the standard error of the area must also be calculated based on the uncertainties in \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( r \\)."
