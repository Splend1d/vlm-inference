    "description": "The image is a political cartoon titled \"Forty-Millionaire Carnegie in his Great Double Role,\" published in The Saturday Globe on July 9, 1892. The cartoon depicts Andrew Carnegie in two contrasting roles. On one side, he is shown as a tight-fisted employer, reducing wages by 20 percent, as indicated by a sign he holds. On the other side, he is depicted as a philanthropist, giving away $5,000 from a chest labeled with a dollar sign. The cartoon suggests that Carnegie reduces wages so that he can play the role of a philanthropist and give away libraries, etc. The scene includes workers reacting to both sides of Carnegie's actions, with some appearing distressed over the wage reduction and others reaching out for the charitable donation. The overall message of the cartoon criticizes Carnegie for his dual nature as both a harsh employer and a generous philanthropist."
