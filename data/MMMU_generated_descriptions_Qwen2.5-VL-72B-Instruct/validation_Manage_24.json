    "description": "The image is a scatter plot titled \"3-Year and 5-Year Annualized Returns for 15 Mutual Funds.\" The x-axis represents the 3-year annualized return (%), ranging from 0 to 20%, while the y-axis represents the 5-year annualized return (%), also ranging from 0 to 25%. There are 15 data points plotted on the graph, each representing a mutual fund's performance over both time periods.\n\nTwo reference lines are included in the graph:\n- A dashed line labeled \"y = 2x,\" which has a steeper slope.\n- A solid line labeled \"y = x,\" which has a slope of 1, indicating where the 3-year and 5-year returns would be equal.\n\nThe data points are scattered around these lines, with some points lying close to the \"y = x\" line. Upon careful observation, **three** data points appear to lie exactly or very close to the \"y = x\" line, suggesting that for those three mutual funds, the 3-year and 5-year annualized returns are approximately equal.\n\nThis information allows us to conclude that the number of funds with equal 3-year and 5-year returns is **three**. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is C. 3."
