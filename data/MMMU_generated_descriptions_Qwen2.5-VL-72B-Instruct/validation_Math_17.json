    "question": "A man at a point P on the shore of a circular lake of radius 1 mile wants to reach the point Q on the shore diametrically opposite P (Fig. 16-5). He can row 1.5 miles per hour and walk 3 miles per hour. At what angle $\\theta $ ($0<\\theta < \\pi /2$) to the diameter PQ should he row in order to minimize the time required to reach Q? <image 1>",

    "description": "The image depicts a circle with center \\( O \\), representing a circular lake with a radius of 1 mile. Points \\( P \\) and \\( Q \\) lie on the circumference of the circle and are diametrically opposite each other, meaning the line segment \\( PQ \\) passes through the center \\( O \\) and forms the diameter of the circle. The length of \\( PQ \\) is therefore 2 miles.\n\nA point \\( R \\) is also marked on the circumference of the circle. The angle \\( \\angle POR \\) is labeled as \\( \\theta \\), and the angle \\( \\angle ROQ \\) is labeled as \\( 2\\theta \\). This implies that the total angle \\( \\angle POQ \\) is \\( \\pi \\) radians (or 180 degrees).\n\nThe problem involves determining the optimal angle \\( \\theta \\) for a man starting at point \\( P \\) to row to point \\( R \\) and then walk along the shore from \\( R \\) to \\( Q \\) in order to minimize the total travel time. The man rows at a speed of 1.5 miles per hour and walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour.\n\nTo solve this, we need to calculate the distances involved:\n1. The distance \\( PR \\) (the arc length subtended by angle \\( \\theta \\)) can be calculated using the formula for arc length: \\( PR = r \\cdot \\theta = 1 \\cdot \\theta = \\theta \\) miles.\n2. The distance \\( RQ \\) (the arc length subtended by angle \\( 2\\theta \\)) can be calculated similarly: \\( RQ = r \\cdot 2\\theta = 1 \\cdot 2\\theta = 2\\theta \\) miles.\n\nThe time taken to row from \\( P \\) to \\( R \\) is \\( \\frac{\\theta}{1.5} \\) hours, and the time taken to walk from \\( R \\) to \\( Q \\) is \\( \\frac{2\\theta}{3} \\) hours. The total time \\( T \\) is given by:\n\\[ T = \\frac{\\theta}{1.5} + \\frac{2\\theta}{3} = \\frac{2\\theta}{3} + \\frac{2\\theta}{3} = \\frac{4\\theta}{3} \\]\n\nTo minimize \\( T \\), we need to find the value of \\( \\theta \\) that minimizes \\( \\frac{4\\theta}{3} \\). Since \\( \\theta \\) must be between 0 and \\( \\pi/2 \\), the minimum value of \\( \\theta \\) within this range is \\( \\theta = \\pi/3 \\).\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{\\theta = \\pi/3} \\]"
