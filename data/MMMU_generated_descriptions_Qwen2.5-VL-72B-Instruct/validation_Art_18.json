    "description": "The image is a 15th-century tempera on panel painting housed in Museums Sheffield. It portrays a female saint with long, flowing brown hair adorned with a golden halo decorated with floral motifs. She wears a green garment with a red cloak draped over her shoulders. The saint holds a small, detailed model of a tower or fortress in her hands, which features multiple levels with arched windows and battlements. Additionally, she holds a palm frond in her other hand, a symbol often associated with martyrdom. The background consists of soft, muted colors depicting a landscape with hills and a blue sky. The combination of the tower and the palm frond are key attributes traditionally linked to Saint Barbara."
