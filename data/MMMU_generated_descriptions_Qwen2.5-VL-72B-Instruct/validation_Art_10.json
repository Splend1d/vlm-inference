    "description": "The image is a painting depicting an outdoor caf\u00e9 scene at night. The caf\u00e9 is brightly lit with warm yellow light, contrasting sharply with the deep blue and black hues of the night sky, which is filled with swirling stars. The tables and chairs outside the caf\u00e9 are arranged neatly, some occupied by figures who appear to be engaged in conversation. The building housing the caf\u00e9 has a distinct yellow facade with visible windows and doors. The street is cobblestone, and there are a few pedestrians walking along it. The overall style of the painting is characterized by bold, expressive brushstrokes and vibrant colors, creating a dynamic and somewhat dreamlike atmosphere. This particular style and technique are highly indicative of the work of Vincent van Gogh."
