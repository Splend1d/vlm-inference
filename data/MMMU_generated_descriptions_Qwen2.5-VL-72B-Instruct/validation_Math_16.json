    "description": "The image illustrates a geometric solution for a nonlinear optimization problem. The figure shows a two-dimensional coordinate system with axes labeled \\( g_1 \\), \\( g_2 \\), and \\( g_3 \\). These axes represent constraints in the problem.\n\n- The feasible region is shaded and bounded by three curves corresponding to the constraints:\n  - \\( g_1 \\): A parabolic curve representing \\( x_1^2 - x_2 - 3 \\leq 0 \\).\n  - \\( g_2 \\): A horizontal line at \\( x_2 = 1 \\) representing \\( x_2 - 1 \\leq 0 \\).\n  - \\( g_3 \\): A vertical line at \\( x_1 = 0 \\) representing \\( -x_1 \\leq 0 \\).\n\n- The contours of the objective function \\( (x_1 - 3)^2 + (x_2 - 2)^2 \\) are shown as concentric circles centered at the point \\( (3, 2) \\).\n\n- The optimal point, where the objective function is minimized within the feasible region, is marked as \\( (2, 1) \\). This point lies on the boundary formed by the intersection of the constraints \\( g_2 \\) and \\( g_3 \\).\n\nThus, the solution to the minimization problem is the point \\( (2, 1) \\)."
