    "description": "The image is a graph labeled \"Graph 1,\" which illustrates the relationship between aggregate demand (consumption = C) and output/income (Y). The x-axis represents output/income (Y), ranging from 0 to 50, while the y-axis represents aggregate demand (consumption = C), ranging from 0 to 40. \n\nA straight line labeled \"C\" is plotted on the graph, starting at the point (0, 10) and ending at the point (50, 40). This line has a positive slope, indicating that as output/income increases, aggregate demand (consumption) also increases. The slope of the line suggests a linear relationship between income and consumption.\n\nThe consumption function can be represented by the equation \\( C = a + bY \\), where:\n- \\( a \\) is the autonomous consumption (the intercept on the y-axis),\n- \\( b \\) is the marginal propensity to consume (the slope of the line).\n\nFrom the graph, we can see that:\n- The value of \\( a \\) is 10, as the line intersects the y-axis at 10.\n- The value of \\( b \\) can be calculated as the change in consumption divided by the change in income. For example, from the points (0, 10) to (50, 40), the change in consumption is 30 and the change in income is 50, so \\( b = \\frac{30}{50} = 0.6 \\).\n\nNow, considering the changes in \\( a \\) and \\( b \\):\n1. If \\( a \\) rises, the intercept on the y-axis will increase, causing the entire consumption line \\( C \\) to shift upwards.\n2. If \\( b \\) rises, the slope of the line will increase, making the line steeper.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nA. C shifts upwards.\nD. (1) C shifts upwards. (2) C gets steeper."
