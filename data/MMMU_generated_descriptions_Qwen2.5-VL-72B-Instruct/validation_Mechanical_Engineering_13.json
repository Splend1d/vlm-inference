    "description": "The image consists of two parts: a top view and four options labeled (a), (b), (c), and (d) for the left view.\n\n### Top View:\n- The top view shows a rectangular shape with a smaller rectangle on top.\n- There are two circular holes near the bottom corners of the larger rectangle.\n- There is a central circular hole in the middle of the larger rectangle.\n- The smaller rectangle on top has a central circular hole.\n\n### Options for Left View:\n- **Option (a):** Shows a circular shape with a smaller circle inside it. There are two smaller circles on either side of the central circle, representing the holes at the bottom corners of the top view. The smaller rectangle on top is represented by a horizontal line across the top of the circle.\n- **Option (b):** Similar to option (a), but the horizontal line representing the smaller rectangle on top is missing.\n- **Option (c):** Similar to option (a), but the two smaller circles on either side of the central circle are missing.\n- **Option (d):** Similar to option (a), but the central circle is missing.\n\nBased on the top view, the correct left view should include all the features present in the top view: the central circle, the two smaller circles on either side, and the horizontal line representing the smaller rectangle on top. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. A"
