    "description": "The image shows a close-up view of an adult white pine weevil (Pissodes strobi). The insect has a robust, cylindrical body covered with fine scales and small hairs, giving it a textured appearance. Its coloration is predominantly brown with patches of white and black, creating a mottled pattern. The weevil's head is slightly darker than its body, and it has a short, curved snout typical of weevils. The antennae are visible and appear segmented. The background consists of what looks like a piece of wood or bark, suggesting the weevil is in its natural habitat.\n\nThe image does not depict the juvenile stage of the white pine weevil but rather the adult form. However, based on entomological knowledge, the juvenile stage of the white pine weevil, which would be found on a spruce branch, is known as a grub. Grubs are the larval stage of weevils and other beetles, characterized by their soft, C-shaped bodies. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is:\n\nE. Grub"
