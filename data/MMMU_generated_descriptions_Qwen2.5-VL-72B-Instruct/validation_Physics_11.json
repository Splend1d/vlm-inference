    "description": "The image depicts a schematic diagram illustrating the passage of a light ray through different media. The light ray is shown entering from the top and traveling vertically downward. The diagram includes three distinct layers labeled with their respective refractive indices (n):\n\n1. **Air**: The topmost layer has a refractive index \\( n = 1.00 \\).\n2. **Glass**: The middle layer has a refractive index \\( n = 1.50 \\). This layer represents a thin film of glass.\n3. **Water**: The bottom layer has a refractive index \\( n = 1.33 \\).\n\nThe thickness of the glass layer is denoted by \\( t \\), which is the variable we need to determine for the question. The light ray travels normally (perpendicularly) through these layers, meaning it strikes each interface at a 90-degree angle.\n\nThe question asks for the minimum thickness \\( t \\) of the glass layer that would result in the reflected light appearing orange, given that the wavelength of orange light in air (\\( \\lambda_{\\text{air}} \\)) is 600 nm. \n\nTo solve this, one must consider the interference conditions for constructive interference of the reflected light, which depends on the optical path length within the glass layer. The formula for the minimum thickness \\( t \\) for constructive interference is:\n\n\\[ 2nt = m\\lambda_{\\text{glass}} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( n \\) is the refractive index of the glass,\n- \\( t \\) is the thickness of the glass layer,\n- \\( m \\) is an integer (for the first minimum, \\( m = 1 \\)),\n- \\( \\lambda_{\\text{glass}} \\) is the wavelength of the light in the glass, calculated as \\( \\lambda_{\\text{glass}} = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{air}}}{n} \\).\n\nGiven \\( \\lambda_{\\text{air}} = 600 \\) nm and \\( n = 1.50 \\), you can calculate \\( \\lambda_{\\text{glass}} \\) and then find \\( t \\)."
