    "description": "The image presents a table with data about three isotopes of magnesium (Mg). The table has three columns: \"Isotope,\" \"Mass (amu),\" and \"Percent Abundance.\" Here's the detailed breakdown:\n\n- **Isotope**: Lists the three isotopes of magnesium:\n  - Mg-24\n  - Mg-25\n  - Mg-26\n\n- **Mass (amu)**: Indicates the atomic mass units for each isotope:\n  - Mg-24 has a mass of 24.0 amu\n  - Mg-25 has a mass of 25.0 amu\n  - Mg-26 has a mass of 26.0 amu\n\n- **Percent Abundance**: Shows the relative abundance of each isotope in nature:\n  - Mg-24 makes up 79.0% of naturally occurring magnesium\n  - Mg-25 makes up 10.0% of naturally occurring magnesium\n  - Mg-26 makes up 11.0% of naturally occurring magnesium\n\nThis table provides all the necessary information to calculate the average atomic mass of magnesium using the given masses and their respective abundances."
