    "description": "The image depicts a fluid mechanics problem involving a pressurized tank connected to an open jet via a smooth pipe. Here's a detailed description:\n\n- **Tank Details**: There is a pressurized tank with a height of 10 meters filled with water. The top of the tank is pressurized at \\( p_1 \\), which is the unknown gauge pressure we need to determine.\n  \n- **Pipe Details**: A smooth pipe with a diameter \\( d = 5 \\) cm (or 0.05 meters) connects the bottom of the tank to an open jet. The pipe has a total length of 30 meters horizontally and then rises vertically for 80 meters before discharging into the open atmosphere as a free jet.\n\n- **Dimensions and Layout**:\n  - The horizontal section of the pipe extends 30 meters from the tank outlet.\n  - The vertical section of the pipe rises 80 meters above the tank outlet.\n  - The total horizontal distance from the tank to the point where the pipe turns upward is 60 meters.\n\n- **Flow Rate**: The desired flow rate \\( Q \\) through the pipe is given as 60 cubic meters per hour (m\u00b3/h).\n\n- **Water Temperature**: The temperature of the water is specified as 20\u00b0C, which may be relevant for determining properties like density or viscosity if needed.\n\n- **Objective**: Determine the gauge pressure \\( p_1 \\) required at the top of the tank to achieve the specified flow rate \\( Q \\). The options provided for \\( p_1 \\) are:\n  - A. 2.38E6 Pa\n  - B. 2.61E5 Pa\n  - C. 1.56E6 Pa\n\nThis setup involves applying principles of fluid dynamics, including Bernoulli's equation and possibly the Darcy-Weisbach equation for head loss due to friction in the pipe. The specific values and layout details are crucial for solving the problem."
