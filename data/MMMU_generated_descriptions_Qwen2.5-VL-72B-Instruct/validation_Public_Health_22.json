    "description": "The provided table details the life expectancy and the number of deaths from cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases and malignant neoplasms across various age groups (20-59 years) within a specific city's working population in 2010. Here's a breakdown:\n\n### Age Groups and Corresponding Data:\n1. **Age Group 20-:**\n   - Life Expectancy: 61.76 years\n   - Deaths from Cardiovascular and Cerebrovascular Diseases: 17\n   - Deaths from Malignant Neoplasms: 8\n\n2. **Age Group 25-:**\n   - Life Expectancy: 56.82 years\n   - Deaths from Cardiovascular and Cerebrovascular Diseases: 32\n   - Deaths from Malignant Neoplasms: 11\n\n3. **Age Group 30-:**\n   - Life Expectancy: 51.89 years\n   - Deaths from Cardiovascular and Cerebrovascular Diseases: 32\n   - Deaths from Malignant Neoplasms: 22\n\n4. **Age Group 35-:**\n   - Life Expectancy: 46.98 years\n   - Deaths from Cardiovascular and Cerebrovascular Diseases: 86\n   - Deaths from Malignant Neoplasms: 28\n\n5. **Age Group 40-:**\n   - Life Expectancy: 42.09 years\n   - Deaths from Cardiovascular and Cerebrovascular Diseases: 186\n   - Deaths from Malignant Neoplasms: 79\n\n6. **Age Group 45-:**\n   - Life Expectancy: 37.25 years\n   - Deaths from Cardiovascular and Cerebrovascular Diseases: 208\n   - Deaths from Malignant Neoplasms: 86\n\n7. **Age Group 50-:**\n   - Life Expectancy: 32.49 years\n   - Deaths from Cardiovascular and Cerebrovascular Diseases: 326\n   - Deaths from Malignant Neoplasms: 168\n\n8. **Age Group 55-59:**\n   - Life Expectancy: 27.85 years\n   - Deaths from Cardiovascular and Cerebrovascular Diseases: 363\n   - Deaths from Malignant Neoplasms: 195\n\n### Totals Across All Age Groups:\n- Total Deaths from Cardiovascular and Cerebrovascular Diseases: 1250\n- Total Deaths from Malignant Neoplasms: 597\n\n### Analysis:\nThe total number of deaths from cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases (1250) significantly exceeds the total number of deaths from malignant neoplasms (597). This indicates that cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases pose a greater health threat compared to malignant neoplasms among the city's working population aged 20-59 in 2010. \n\nThus, the correct answer is A. cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases."
