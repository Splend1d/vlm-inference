    "options": "['57.4%', '74.5%', '67.4%', '54.7%']",

    "description": "The image presents a table with two columns and three rows. The first row serves as the header, indicating the parameters measured:\n\n- The first column header reads \"\u03c1 (g/cm\u00b3)\", which stands for density in grams per cubic centimeter.\n- The second column header reads \"crystallinity (%)\", which indicates the percentage of crystallinity.\n\nBelow the headers, there are two data entries:\n\n1. For the first entry:\n   - The density (\u03c1) is 1.408 g/cm\u00b3.\n   - The corresponding crystallinity is 74.3%.\n\n2. For the second entry:\n   - The density (\u03c1) is 1.343 g/cm\u00b3.\n   - The corresponding crystallinity is 31.2%.\n\nThis table provides a relationship between the density and crystallinity of poly(ethylene terephthalate) materials. The data suggests that as the density decreases, so does the crystallinity."
