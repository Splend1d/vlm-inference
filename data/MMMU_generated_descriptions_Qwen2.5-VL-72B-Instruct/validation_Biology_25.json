    "question": "Consider the diagram in <image 1> regarding a mountainous region. The diagram shows the average winter temperature (left-hand y-axis) at different altitudes (x-axis) and the abundance of three tree species (right-hand y-axis) at different altitudes (x-axis). Which species is/are found below an altitude of 500m?",
    "options": "['Species 1 only', 'Species 2 only', 'Species 3 only', 'Species 1 and 2 only', 'Species 2 and 3 only']",

    "description": "The image is a graph with two y-axes and one x-axis. The left y-axis represents \"Average temperature\" in degrees Celsius, ranging from -5\u00b0C to 20\u00b0C. The right y-axis represents \"Abundance (Number per km\u00b2)\" for three tree species, ranging from 0 to 250. The x-axis represents \"Altitude (m)\" ranging from 0 to 2000 meters.\n\nThere are four lines on the graph:\n\n1. A blue line labeled \"Average temperature,\" which starts at approximately 17\u00b0C at sea level (0 meters altitude), peaks around 18\u00b0C at about 400 meters altitude, and then gradually decreases to around -5\u00b0C at 2000 meters altitude.\n   \n2. A black line labeled \"Species 1,\" which starts at an abundance of approximately 200 per km\u00b2 at sea level, increases slightly to its peak abundance just above 200 per km\u00b2 near 500 meters altitude, and then sharply declines to zero abundance at around 1000 meters altitude.\n\n3. Another black line labeled \"Species 2,\" which starts at zero abundance at sea level, increases steadily to reach its peak abundance of approximately 100 per km\u00b2 at around 1000 meters altitude, and then declines back to zero abundance at around 1500 meters altitude.\n\n4. The last black line labeled \"Species 3,\" which also starts at zero abundance at sea level, increases to reach its peak abundance of approximately 100 per km\u00b2 at around 1800 meters altitude, and then declines back to zero abundance at around 2000 meters altitude.\n\nFrom this description, it is clear that Species 1 has a non-zero abundance below an altitude of 500 meters, while Species 2 and Species 3 have zero abundance below this altitude. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is:\n\nA. Species 1 only"
