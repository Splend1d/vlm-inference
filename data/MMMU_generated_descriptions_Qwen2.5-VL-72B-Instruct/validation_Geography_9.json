    "description": "The image is a population pyramid graph displaying demographic information categorized by age and gender. The x-axis represents the population in thousands, ranging from -4 to 4, with negative values indicating males and positive values indicating females. The y-axis represents age, ranging from 0 to 110 years old. The data points are plotted as a blue line labeled \"observed,\" showing the distribution of the population across different age groups.\n\nKey observations:\n- The population is relatively evenly distributed between males and females across most age groups.\n- There is a noticeable peak in the younger age groups (around 0-20 years), indicating a higher proportion of children and young adults.\n- The population density decreases gradually as age increases, with fewer individuals in the older age groups (above 60 years).\n- The year of birth is listed on the right side of the graph, ranging from 1911 to 2021, suggesting the data spans over a century.\n\nBased on these characteristics, the population pyramid suggests a developing country with a relatively young population and a high birth rate. Among the given options, **Kiribati** fits this description best, as it is known for its young population and high birth rate compared to the other countries listed."
