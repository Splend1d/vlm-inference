    "description": "The image presents two transaction sequences, labeled \\( T_1 \\) and \\( T_2 \\), each consisting of a series of operations involving read locks, write locks, item reads, item writes, and unlocks on variables \\( X \\) and \\( Y \\). The operations for each transaction are as follows:\n\n### Transaction \\( T_1 \\):\n1. `read_lock(Y);` - Acquires a read lock on variable \\( Y \\).\n2. `read_item(Y);` - Reads the value of variable \\( Y \\).\n3. `unlock(Y);` - Releases the lock on variable \\( Y \\).\n4. `write_lock(X);` - Acquires a write lock on variable \\( X \\).\n5. `read_item(X);` - Reads the value of variable \\( X \\).\n6. `X := X + Y;` - Updates the value of \\( X \\) by adding the value of \\( Y \\) to it.\n7. `write_item(X);` - Writes the updated value of \\( X \\) back.\n8. `unlock(X);` - Releases the lock on variable \\( X \\).\n\n### Transaction \\( T_2 \\):\n1. `read_lock(X);` - Acquires a read lock on variable \\( X \\).\n2. `read_item(X);` - Reads the value of variable \\( X \\).\n3. `unlock(X);` - Releases the lock on variable \\( X \\).\n4. `write_lock(Y);` - Acquires a write lock on variable \\( Y \\).\n5. `read_item(Y);` - Reads the value of variable \\( Y \\).\n6. `Y := X + Y;` - Updates the value of \\( Y \\) by adding the value of \\( X \\) to it.\n7. `write_item(Y);` - Writes the updated value of \\( Y \\) back.\n8. `unlock(Y);` - Releases the lock on variable \\( Y \\).\n\nInitially, \\( X = 20 \\) and \\( Y = 30 \\). The transactions are executed serially with \\( T_1 \\) preceding \\( T_2 \\)."
