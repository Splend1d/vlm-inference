    "question": "What is the part of the cell labeled 'B' in <image 1>?",
    "options": "['Flagellum', 'Plasma membrane', 'Nucleus', 'Cell wall', 'Cytoplasm', 'Mitochondria', 'Centrioles']",
    "id": "validation_Biology_21",
    "description": "The image is a detailed diagram of an animal cell. The cell is depicted with various organelles and structures labeled by letters from A to H. \n\n- Label 'A' points to a structure within the nucleus, which appears to be the nucleolus.\n- Label 'B' indicates a large, roughly spherical structure located near the center of the cell. This structure is surrounded by a double membrane and contains a smaller, dense region (the nucleolus) indicated by label 'A'. \n- Label 'C' points to the nuclear envelope, which is the double membrane surrounding the nucleus.\n- Label 'D' points to the cytoplasm, which fills the cell and surrounds the various organelles.\n- Label 'E' points to the mitochondria, which are rod-shaped organelles scattered throughout the cytoplasm.\n- Label 'F' points to the endoplasmic reticulum, which is a network of membranous tubules extending throughout the cytoplasm.\n- Label 'G' points to the Golgi apparatus, which consists of flattened, stacked sacs located near the nucleus.\n- Label 'H' points to the flagellum, which is a long, whip-like structure extending from the cell.\n\nBased on this description, the part of the cell labeled 'B' is the **nucleus**. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is:\n\nC. Nucleus"
