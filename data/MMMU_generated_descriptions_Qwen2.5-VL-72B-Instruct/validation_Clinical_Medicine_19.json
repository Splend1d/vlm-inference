    "question": "A 48-year-old woman has experienced episodes of sharp abdominal pain for the past month. On physical examination there is tenderness upon palpation of her right upper quadrant. Laparoscopic surgery is performed and the gross appearance of her disease process is depicted here. Which of the following is the most likely risk factor for her disease? <image 1> ",
    "options": "['Gilbert disease', 'Cytomegalovirus infection', 'Hemolytic anemia', 'Ulcerative colitis', 'Obesity']",

    "description": "The image shows a cross-sectional view of a gallbladder with multiple gallstones visible within it. The stones vary in size and color, ranging from yellow to brownish-yellow. The gallbladder wall appears thickened and inflamed. A ruler next to the specimen indicates the size of the gallbladder and stones, suggesting that the stones are relatively large. The presence of numerous gallstones and the thickened, inflamed gallbladder wall are characteristic findings of cholelithiasis (gallstone disease) and cholecystitis (inflammation of the gallbladder).\n\nGiven these observations, the most likely risk factor for this disease process is obesity. Obesity is a well-known risk factor for the development of gallstones due to increased cholesterol levels in bile, which can lead to stone formation. The other options listed\u2014Gilbert disease, cytomegalovirus infection, hemolytic anemia, and ulcerative colitis\u2014are less directly associated with the development of gallstones and the specific pathology shown in the image."
