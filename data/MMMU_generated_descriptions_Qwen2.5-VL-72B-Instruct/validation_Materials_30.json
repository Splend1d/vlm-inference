    "description": "The image shows a triangular plate with a base length of 800 mm and a height of 800 mm. The triangle is oriented such that its base lies along the x-axis, and its apex (point A) is located at the top-right corner. The triangle has three angles of 45\u00b0 each, making it an isosceles right triangle.\n\nThe apex A is displaced horizontally to a new position labeled as A', which is 5 mm to the right of the original position A. This displacement is indicated by a dashed line connecting A to A'. The x-axis runs horizontally through the base of the triangle, and the y-axis runs vertically through the left side of the triangle.\n\nThe problem involves determining the average normal strain \\( \\varepsilon_x \\) along the x-axis due to this horizontal displacement of the apex. The strain is defined as the change in length divided by the original length. In this case, the change in length is the horizontal displacement of the apex (5 mm), and the original length is the base of the triangle (800 mm).\n\nThe average normal strain \\( \\varepsilon_x \\) can be calculated using the formula:\n\\[ \\varepsilon_x = \\frac{\\Delta L}{L} \\]\nwhere \\( \\Delta L \\) is the change in length (5 mm) and \\( L \\) is the original length (800 mm).\n\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n\\[ \\varepsilon_x = \\frac{5 \\text{ mm}}{800 \\text{ mm}} = 0.00625 \\text{ mm/mm} \\]\n\nHowever, since the options provided do not include 0.00625 mm/mm, we need to check the closest value. The closest value to 0.00625 mm/mm among the given options is 0.00543 mm/mm.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{0.00543 \\text{ mm/mm}} \\]"
