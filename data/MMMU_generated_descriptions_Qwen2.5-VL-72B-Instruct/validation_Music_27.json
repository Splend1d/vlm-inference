    "description": "The image shows a musical score written in 3/4 time signature. The melody consists of two lines of music with a total of 16 measures. Here's a detailed breakdown:\n\n### First Line (Measures 1-8):\n1. **Measure 1**: Starts with a dotted quarter note B-flat followed by an eighth note C-flat and a quarter note F.\n2. **Measure 2**: Contains a dotted quarter note B-flat, a quarter note A-flat, and a quarter note G-flat.\n3. **Measure 3**: Features a dotted half note F and a quarter note E-flat.\n4. **Measure 4**: Includes three groups of triplets: each triplet group has a G-flat, an F-double-sharp, and an A-flat.\n5. **Measure 5**: Begins with a dotted quarter note F-sharp, followed by an eighth note G and a quarter note A-flat.\n6. **Measure 6**: Has a dotted quarter note B-flat, a triplet group with B-flat, A-flat, and G-flat, and another triplet group with F-double-sharp, E-flat, and D-flat.\n7. **Measure 7**: Starts with a dotted quarter note G, followed by an eighth note A and a quarter note B-flat.\n8. **Measure 8**: Contains a dotted quarter note B-flat, a quarter note A-flat, and a quarter note G-flat.\n\n### Second Line (Measures 9-16):\n1. **Measure 9**: Begins with a dotted quarter note F-sharp, followed by an eighth note G and a quarter note A-flat.\n2. **Measure 10**: Has a dotted quarter note B-flat, a triplet group with B-flat, A-flat, and G-flat, and another triplet group with F-double-sharp, E-flat, and D-flat.\n3. **Measure 11**: Starts with a dotted quarter note G, followed by an eighth note A and a quarter note B-flat.\n4. **Measure 12**: Contains a dotted quarter note B-flat, a quarter note A-flat, and a quarter note G-flat.\n5. **Measure 13**: Begins with a dotted quarter note F-sharp, followed by an eighth note G and a quarter note A-flat.\n6. **Measure 14**: Has a dotted quarter note B-flat, a triplet group with B-flat, A-flat, and G-flat, and another triplet group with F-double-sharp, E-flat, and D-flat.\n7. **Measure 15**: Starts with a dotted quarter note G, followed by an eighth note A and a quarter note B-flat.\n8. **Measure 16**: Ends with a dotted quarter note B-flat, a quarter note A-flat, and a quarter rest.\n\n### Enharmonic Modulation:\nEnharmonic modulation occurs when a note or chord is spelled differently but sounds the same. In this melody, there are two instances where F-double-sharp is used instead of G-flat, which is an example of enharmonic modulation. These occur in Measures 4 and 6 of the first line and Measures 10 and 14 of the second line.\n\nTherefore, the number of times enharmonic modulation appears in the melody is **2**."
