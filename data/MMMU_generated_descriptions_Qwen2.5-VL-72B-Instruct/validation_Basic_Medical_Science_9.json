    "description": "The image is a graph depicting the changes in membrane potential (measured in millivolts, mV) over time (measured in milliseconds). The x-axis represents time, ranging from 0 to 7 milliseconds, while the y-axis represents the membrane potential, ranging from -100 mV to +50 mV.\n\nKey points on the graph are labeled A through F:\n\n- **A**: This point is at the resting membrane potential, which is around -70 mV.\n- **B**: This point marks the beginning of depolarization, where the membrane potential starts to rise sharply.\n- **C**: This point indicates the threshold potential, where the membrane potential reaches approximately -50 mV, initiating an action potential.\n- **D**: This point represents the peak of the action potential, where the membrane potential reaches its maximum value, around +40 mV.\n- **E**: This point shows the repolarization phase, where the membrane potential begins to decrease after reaching its peak, moving back towards the resting potential.\n- **F**: This point indicates the hyperpolarization phase, where the membrane potential dips below the resting potential before returning to it.\n\nBased on this description, E corresponds to the repolarization phase of the action potential. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Repolarization."
