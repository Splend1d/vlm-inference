    "description": "The image depicts a three-phase balanced Y-connected load circuit with the following components:\n\n- **Voltage Source:** The line-to-neutral voltage (\\(\\vec{V}_{an}\\)) is given as \\(390 \\angle 30^\\circ\\) Vrms. This indicates a balanced three-phase system with a phase angle of \\(30^\\circ\\).\n- **Frequency:** The frequency (\\(f\\)) of the source is \\(60 \\text{ Hz}\\).\n- **Capacitance:** Each branch of the Y-connected load has a capacitance (\\(C\\)) of \\(5 \\mu\\text{F}\\).\n- **Inductance:** Each branch also includes an inductance (\\(L\\)) of \\(0.56 \\text{ H}\\).\n\n### Circuit Configuration:\n- The three-phase system consists of three voltage sources connected to points \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), which are connected to the neutral point \\(n\\). \n- The Y-connected load is connected between points \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(N\\), where \\(N\\) is the neutral point of the load.\n- Each branch of the Y-connected load (between \\(A-N\\), \\(B-N\\), and \\(C-N\\)) contains both a capacitor (\\(C\\)) and an inductor (\\(L\\)) in series.\n\n### Key Parameters:\n- The capacitive reactance (\\(X_C\\)) for each capacitor can be calculated using \\(X_C = \\frac{1}{2\\pi f C}\\).\n- The inductive reactance (\\(X_L\\)) for each inductor can be calculated using \\(X_L = 2\\pi f L\\).\n\n### Calculation of Reactances:\n- For \\(C = 5 \\mu\\text{F}\\) and \\(f = 60 \\text{ Hz}\\):\n  \\[\n  X_C = \\frac{1}{2\\pi \\times 60 \\times 5 \\times 10^{-6}} \\approx 530.52 \\Omega\n  \\]\n- For \\(L = 0.56 \\text{ H}\\) and \\(f = 60 \\text{ Hz}\\):\n  \\[\n  X_L = 2\\pi \\times 60 \\times 0.56 \\approx 211.17 \\Omega\n  \\]\n\n### Impedance of Each Branch:\n- The impedance (\\(Z\\)) of each branch is the combination of the inductive and capacitive reactances:\n  \\[\n  Z = X_L - X_C = 211.17 - 530.52 \\approx -319.35 \\Omega\n  \\]\n  Since \\(Z\\) is negative, it indicates a capacitive nature.\n\n### Phase Angle:\n- The phase angle (\\(\\theta\\)) of the current relative to the voltage is determined by the capacitive nature of the load:\n  \\[\n  \\theta = \\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{-X_C + X_L}{R}\\right)\n  \\]\n  Since there is no resistance (\\(R = 0\\)), the phase angle is purely due to the reactance:\n  \\[\n  \\theta = \\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{-319.35}{0}\\right) = -90^\\circ\n  \\]\n\nThus, the phase of \\(I_{cC}\\) is \\(-90^\\circ\\)."
