    "description": "The image consists of four graphs labeled A, B, C, and D, each depicting the relationship between power (P) and current (I).\n\n- **Graph A**: This graph shows a curve where power (P) increases rapidly as the current (I) increases. The curve starts at the origin (0,0) and becomes steeper as the current increases, indicating a non-linear relationship between power and current.\n  \n- **Graph B**: This graph displays a straight line that slopes downward from left to right. It starts at a positive value on the P-axis when I is zero and decreases linearly until it reaches zero power at some positive value of current. This indicates an inverse linear relationship between power and current.\n  \n- **Graph C**: This graph shows a straight line that starts at the origin (0,0) and slopes upward as the current increases. The line has a constant slope, indicating a direct linear relationship between power and current.\n  \n- **Graph D**: This graph depicts a curve where power (P) decreases as the current (I) increases. The curve starts at a high value of power when the current is close to zero and gradually flattens out as the current increases, approaching but never reaching zero power. This suggests an inverse relationship between power and current, but not a simple linear one.\n\nThe question asks which graph represents the relationship between power (P) and current (I) for a component that obeys Ohm's law. According to Ohm's law, the power dissipated in a resistor is given by \\( P = I^2 R \\), where R is a constant resistance. This implies that power is directly proportional to the square of the current, resulting in a parabolic relationship. However, for simplicity, in many cases, especially over small ranges, this can appear as a linear relationship when plotted.\n\nGiven these descriptions, **Graph C** shows a linear relationship between power and current, which is consistent with the simplified interpretation of Ohm's law for power dissipation. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. C**"
