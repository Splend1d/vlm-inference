    "description": "The image displays a table titled \"ESTIMATED REA EXPRESS RATES,\" which outlines shipping costs based on weight and distance. The table includes the following details:\n\n- **Minimum Charge:** The minimum charge for any shipment will never be less than $6.75.\n- **Weight Categories:** The weights are divided into four categories: \n  - 1 to 25 pounds\n  - 26 to 50 pounds\n  - 51 to 75 pounds\n  - 76 to 100 pounds\n- **Distance Categories:** The distances are divided into six ranges:\n  - Up to 100 miles\n  - 101 to 200 miles\n  - 201 to 300 miles\n  - 301 to 400 miles\n  - 401 to 500 miles\n  - 501 to 700 miles\n\nEach cell in the table provides the corresponding cost for a specific weight and distance combination. For example:\n\n- Shipping an item weighing between 1 to 25 pounds up to 100 miles costs $7.30.\n- Shipping an item weighing between 26 to 50 pounds for 201 to 300 miles costs $9.20.\n  \nTo find the estimated REA charge for shipping a 34-pound item 295 miles, you would look at the row for \"26 to 50 pounds\" and the column for \"201 to 300 miles.\" The value in this cell is $9.20. Therefore, the estimated REA charge for shipping a 34-pound item 295 miles is $9.20."
