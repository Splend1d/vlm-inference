    "question": "25 year old immigrant with fever and several month history of cord problems. The most likely etiology of this process is: <image 1>",
    "options": "['Trypanosomiasis', 'Amebic encephalitis', 'Cerebral malaria', 'Tuberculous meningitis', 'Aspergillosis']",

    "description": "The image shows a histological section stained in pinkish-purple tones, indicative of a tissue sample viewed under a microscope. The sample appears to display granulomatous inflammation, characterized by clusters of immune cells forming nodular structures. These granulomas are irregularly shaped and vary in size, with some showing central necrosis, which is suggested by the lighter areas within the granulomas. The surrounding tissue appears to have a fibrous reaction, with strands of connective tissue extending between the granulomas. There are no visible parasites, fungi, or other pathogens directly observable in the image. The overall appearance is consistent with a chronic inflammatory process, commonly associated with certain infectious diseases that cause granulomatous reactions in the central nervous system. \n\nGiven the clinical context provided (fever, cord problems over several months), and the histological findings of granulomatous inflammation, the most likely etiology among the given options is:\n\nD. Tuberculous meningitis\n\nThis diagnosis is supported by the presence of granulomas with central necrosis, which is characteristic of tuberculosis infection in the central nervous system. The other options do not typically present with this specific histological pattern."
