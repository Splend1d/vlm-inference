    "question": "A student placed 20 tobacco seeds of the same species on moist paper towels in each of two petri dishes. Dish A was wrapped completely in an opaque cover to exclude all light. Dish B was not wrapped. The dishes were placed equidistant from a light source set to a cycle of 14 h of light and 10 h of dark. All other conditions were the same for both dishes. The dishes were examined after seven days, and the opaque cover was permanently removed from dish A. Both dishes were returned to the light and examined again at 14 days. The following data were obtained: <image 1> What best describes the usefulness of the yellow-leaved phenotype as a variation subject to natural selection?",
    "options": "['The yellow-leaved phenotype can germinate in environments without light.', 'The germination of the yellow-leaved phenotype is unaffected by light intensity.', 'The germination of the yellow-leaved phenotype is accelerated as compared to the green-leaved phenotype.', 'The yellow-leaved phenotype cannot germinate in environments with light.']",

    "description": "The image presents data collected from two petri dishes (Dish A and Dish B) containing 20 tobacco seeds each. The experimental setup involved different light conditions for the two dishes:\n\n### Dish A:\n- **Day 7 (covered):** \n  - Germinated seeds: 12\n  - Green-leaved seedlings: 0\n  - Yellow-leaved seedlings: 12\n  - Mean stem length below the first set of leaves: 8 mm\n\n- **Day 14 (uncovered):**\n  - Germinated seeds: 20\n  - Green-leaved seedlings: 14\n  - Yellow-leaved seedlings: 6\n  - Mean stem length below the first set of leaves: 9 mm\n\n### Dish B:\n- **Day 7 (uncovered):**\n  - Germinated seeds: 20\n  - Green-leaved seedlings: 15\n  - Yellow-leaved seedlings: 5\n  - Mean stem length below the first set of leaves: 3 mm\n\n- **Day 14 (covered):**\n  - Germinated seeds: 20\n  - Green-leaved seedlings: 15\n  - Yellow-leaved seedlings: 5\n  - Mean stem length below the first set of leaves: 3 mm\n\n\n### Summary of Observations:\n- In Dish A, when covered (no light), all germinated seeds developed yellow leaves initially. After uncovering, some of these yellow-leaved seedlings turned green over time.\n- In Dish B, when uncovered (with light), most germinated seeds developed green leaves. Covering Dish B later did not change the number of green or yellow-leaved seedlings but affected their stem lengths.\n- The mean stem length below the first set of leaves was longer in Dish A under no light conditions compared to Dish B under light conditions.\n\n\nThis data indicates that the presence or absence of light significantly affects the development of leaf color in the seedlings. Specifically, yellow-leaved seedlings appear to develop in the absence of light, while green-leaved seedlings develop in the presence of light."
