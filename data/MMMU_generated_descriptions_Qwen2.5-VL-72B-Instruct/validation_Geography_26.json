    "description": "The provided image is a technical drawing of a rectangular foundation or footing plan with dimensions and structural details. The overall shape is a rectangle with an internal smaller rectangle in the center. Here's a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Dimensions:\n- **Outer Rectangle:**\n  - Length along the x-axis: 2600 mm.\n  - Width along the y-axis: 1600 mm.\n- **Inner Rectangle:**\n  - Length along the x-axis: 1000 mm.\n  - Width along the y-axis: 400 mm.\n  - Positioned centrally within the outer rectangle.\n\n### Structural Details:\n- **Columns:** \n  - Four columns are located at the corners of the outer rectangle. Each column has a square cross-section with a dimension of 300 mm by 300 mm.\n  - Two additional columns are positioned symmetrically along the longer sides of the inner rectangle, each also having a 300 mm by 300 mm cross-section.\n- **Reinforcement:**\n  - The central area of the inner rectangle contains a grid-like pattern, likely representing reinforcement bars. This grid is evenly spaced and covers the entire inner rectangle area.\n- **Other Dimensions:**\n  - The distance between the inner rectangle and the outer rectangle edges is consistent on all sides, ensuring symmetry.\n\n### Axes:\n- The x-axis and y-axis are marked, with the origin at the bottom left corner of the outer rectangle. The axes help in locating the positions of the columns and other features accurately.\n\n### Material and Context:\n- The image appears to represent a reinforced concrete footing or foundation, commonly used in civil engineering projects like buildings or bridges. The dimensions and reinforcement details suggest it is designed to support significant loads.\n\n### Relation to the Question:\nThe image does not provide any direct information about rock mass structure types or classifications related to geological investigations. Therefore, the question about rock mass structure types cannot be directly answered using this image alone. However, the image provides sufficient context to understand that it pertains to a structural engineering drawing rather than geological classification. \n\nThus, the correct answer to the question would be unrelated to the image content and should be determined based on knowledge of the \"Code for Geological Investigation of Water Resources and Hydropower Engineering\" (GB Classification of Rock Mass Structure for 50287-99)."
