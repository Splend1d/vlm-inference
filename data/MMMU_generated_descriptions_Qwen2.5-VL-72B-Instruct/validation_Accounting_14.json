    "question": "A new company started production. Job 1 was completed, and Job 2 remains in production. Here is the information from the job cost sheets from their first and only jobs so far: <image 1> Using the information provided, what is the balance in finished goods inventory?",
    "options": "['$10,208', '$10,308', '$10,408', '$10,508']",

    "description": "The image presents two tables summarizing the costs for two separate jobs, labeled \"Job 1\" and \"Job 2.\" Each table includes details about the hours worked and total costs associated with direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead. The final row in each table provides the total cost for the respective job.\n\n**Job 1 Table:**\n- **Direct materials:** $375\n- **Direct labor:** 231 hours, Total Cost $5,313\n- **Manufacturing overhead:** $4,620\n- **Total cost:** $10,308\n\n**Job 2 Table:**\n- **Direct materials:** $405\n- **Direct labor:** 85 hours, Total Cost $1,955\n- **Manufacturing overhead:** $1,700\n- **Total cost (partial):** $4,060 (This value seems to be an intermediate sum, possibly representing the total cost up to this point but not the final total cost.)\n\nFrom the given data:\n- Job 1 has been completed, and its total cost is fully calculated at $10,308.\n- Job 2 is still in progress, and its total cost is partially calculated at $4,060.\n\nThe question asks for the balance in finished goods inventory. Since Job 1 is completed and Job 2 is still in progress, the balance in finished goods inventory corresponds to the total cost of Job 1.\n\nTherefore, the balance in finished goods inventory is $10,308."
