    "options": "['4 times greater than the force of the tractor on the trailer.', '2 times greater than the force of the tractor on the trailer.', 'equal to the force of the tractor on the trailer.', '1/4 the force of the tractor on the trailer.']",

    "description": "The image depicts a simplified diagram of a tractor-trailer truck. The truck consists of two main parts: the tractor and the trailer. The tractor is labeled \"Tractor\" and is positioned on the left side of the image. It has a cab and an engine compartment, with two visible wheels underneath. The trailer is labeled \"Trailer\" and is attached to the tractor via a coupling mechanism. The trailer is much larger in size compared to the tractor and has two visible wheels at its rear end. The diagram clearly shows the relative positions and connections between the tractor and the trailer, emphasizing their structural relationship in the context of the vehicle's design. There are no additional details or annotations beyond these labels and the basic outline of the truck components."
