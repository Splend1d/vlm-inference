    "description": "The image shows a 4x4 matrix with numbers from 1 to 16 arranged in a grid format. The numbers are connected by arrows indicating a specific traversal path:\n\n- Starting from the top-left corner (1), the traversal moves rightward through the first row: 1 \u2192 2 \u2192 3 \u2192 4.\n- Then it moves downward to the next row's last element (8): 4 \u2193 8.\n- Next, it continues leftward through the second row in reverse: 8 \u2190 7 \u2190 6 \u2190 5.\n- It then moves downward to the third row's first element (9): 5 \u2193 9.\n- The traversal proceeds rightward through the third row: 9 \u2192 10 \u2192 11 \u2192 12.\n- It then moves downward to the fourth row's last element (16): 12 \u2193 16.\n- Finally, it traverses leftward through the fourth row in reverse: 16 \u2190 15 \u2190 14 \u2190 13.\n\nThe output sequence provided is: 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, 16, 15, 14, 13, 9, 5, 6, 7, 11, 10.\n\nThis traversal pattern follows a spiral order, moving clockwise around the matrix, layer by layer, until all elements are visited."
