    "description": "The image presents a payoff matrix for a game theory scenario involving two firms, Firm 1 and Firm 2. The outcome being measured is profit, with the relationship between output and price noted: low output leads to high prices, while high output results in low prices.\n\nThe matrix is structured as follows:\n\n- **Rows** represent the strategies of Firm 1, with \"Low output\" as the first row and \"High output\" as the second row.\n- **Columns** represent the strategies of Firm 2, with \"Low output\" as the first column and \"High output\" as the second column.\n- Each cell within the matrix contains two numbers separated by a comma. The first number represents the profit for Firm 1, and the second number represents the profit for Firm 2.\n\nHere are the specific payoffs for each combination of strategies:\n\n1. If both Firm 1 and Firm 2 choose \"Low output\":\n   - Firm 1's profit = 3\n   - Firm 2's profit = 3\n\n2. If Firm 1 chooses \"Low output\" and Firm 2 chooses \"High output\":\n   - Firm 1's profit = 0\n   - Firm 2's profit = 5\n\n3. If Firm 1 chooses \"High output\" and Firm 2 chooses \"Low output\":\n   - Firm 1's profit = 5\n   - Firm 2's profit = 0\n\n4. If both Firm 1 and Firm 2 choose \"High output\":\n   - Firm 1's profit = 2\n   - Firm 2's profit = 2\n\nThe matrix highlights the profits using colors:\n- Green indicates higher profits.\n- Red indicates lower profits.\n\nFrom this setup, it can be observed that choosing \"High output\" yields a higher profit for each firm regardless of the other firm's choice. For example, if Firm 2 chooses \"Low output,\" Firm 1 earns more by choosing \"High output\" (5 vs. 3). Similarly, if Firm 2 chooses \"High output,\" Firm 1 still earns more by choosing \"High output\" (2 vs. 0). The same logic applies to Firm 2. Therefore, \"High output\" is the dominant strategy for both firms."
