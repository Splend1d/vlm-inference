    "description": "The image shows a graph with a horizontal axis labeled \"x\" ranging from 0 to 10. A smooth, downward-sloping curve starts at the y-axis near the top left corner and gradually approaches the x-axis as it moves to the right. The curve appears to represent a probability density function (PDF).\n\nOn this graph, there is a shaded rectangular area under the curve. This shaded area is located between two vertical lines on the x-axis. The left boundary of the shaded area aligns with the value 6 on the x-axis, and the right boundary aligns with the value 7 on the x-axis. The shaded area represents the probability of the random variable \\( x \\) falling within the interval from 6 to 7. \n\nTherefore, the shaded area corresponds to \\( P(6 < x < 7) \\)."
