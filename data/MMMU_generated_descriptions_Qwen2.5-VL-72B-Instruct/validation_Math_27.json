    "description": "The image shows a circle with center \\( O \\). Inside the circle, there are two chords, \\( \\overline{AB} \\) and \\( \\overline{CD} \\), which intersect at point \\( E \\). The points \\( A \\), \\( B \\), \\( C \\), and \\( D \\) lie on the circumference of the circle. The segments formed by the intersection at \\( E \\) are labeled as follows: \\( CE = 10 \\), \\( ED = 6 \\), and \\( AE = 4 \\). The goal is to find the length of \\( \\overline{EB} \\).\n\nThe key geometric property used here is the Intersecting Chords Theorem, which states that for two chords \\( \\overline{AB} \\) and \\( \\overline{CD} \\) intersecting at point \\( E \\), the products of the lengths of the segments of each chord are equal. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n\\[ AE \\cdot EB = CE \\cdot ED \\]\n\nSubstituting the given values into the equation:\n\\[ 4 \\cdot EB = 10 \\cdot 6 \\]\n\\[ 4 \\cdot EB = 60 \\]\n\\[ EB = \\frac{60}{4} \\]\n\\[ EB = 15 \\]\n\nThus, the length of \\( \\overline{EB} \\) is \\( 15 \\). The correct answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{15}\n\\]"
