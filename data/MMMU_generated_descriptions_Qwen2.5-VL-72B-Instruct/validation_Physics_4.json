    "description": "The image depicts a light ray entering a block of plastic from air. The boundary between the air and the plastic is horizontal. The light ray initially travels through the air and strikes the boundary at point P. At this point, it refracts into the plastic. \n\n- In the air, the angle of incidence (the angle between the incident ray and the normal to the boundary) is 37\u00b0.\n- In the plastic, the angle of refraction (the angle between the refracted ray and the normal to the boundary) is 53\u00b0.\n\nThe diagram also shows the path of the light ray within the plastic, which continues downward and strikes another boundary at point Q, but this part is not relevant for determining the speed of light in the plastic using the information at point P.\n\nTo solve the problem, you need to use Snell's Law, which relates the angles of incidence and refraction to the indices of refraction of the two media (air and plastic). The index of refraction \\( n \\) is related to the speed of light \\( v \\) in the medium by the equation \\( n = \\frac{c}{v} \\), where \\( c \\) is the speed of light in a vacuum (approximately \\( 3 \\times 10^8 \\) m/s).\n\nSnell's Law states:\n\\[ n_{\\text{air}} \\sin(\\theta_{\\text{incidence}}) = n_{\\text{plastic}} \\sin(\\theta_{\\text{refraction}}) \\]\n\nGiven that the index of refraction of air \\( n_{\\text{air}} \\) is approximately 1, you can rearrange the equation to find \\( n_{\\text{plastic}} \\):\n\\[ n_{\\text{plastic}} = \\frac{\\sin(37^\\circ)}{\\sin(53^\\circ)} \\]\n\nOnce you have \\( n_{\\text{plastic}} \\), you can find the speed of light in the plastic \\( v \\) using:\n\\[ v = \\frac{c}{n_{\\text{plastic}}} \\]"
