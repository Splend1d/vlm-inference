    "question": "The RB gene encodes the retinoblastoma protein (pRB). Note: As shown in <image 1>, the dephosphorylated pRB protein is active in G1 phase. pRB binds to the transcription factor E2F and prevents E2F mediated G1->S transition. The Cyclin D-Cdk4 complex produced during G1, phosphorylates and thereby inactivates pRB. This allows the cell to enter S phase. The p16 protein inhibits the Cyclin D-Cdk4 complex. In which process are the proteins encoded by the target genes of E2F most likely to function? ",

    "description": "The image illustrates a simplified diagram of the G1 to S phase transition in the cell cycle, focusing on the regulation of this transition by various proteins. Here's a detailed breakdown:\n\n- **G1 to S Transition**: The diagram shows an arrow labeled \"G1\" pointing towards \"S,\" indicating the progression from the G1 phase to the S phase of the cell cycle.\n  \n- **E2F Transcription Factor**: The transcription factor E2F is depicted as a box with an arrow pointing upwards toward the G1 to S transition. This suggests that E2F plays a role in promoting the entry into the S phase.\n\n- **Retinoblastoma Protein (pRB)**: The pRB protein is represented as a box with a perpendicular line intersecting the arrow leading from E2F to the G1 to S transition. This indicates that pRB acts as a negative regulator, preventing E2F from promoting the G1 to S transition when it is active.\n\n- **Cyclin D and Cdk4 Complex**: A circular shape labeled \"Cyclin D\" is shown overlapping with a box labeled \"Cdk4.\" This represents the Cyclin D-Cdk4 complex. An arrow leads from this complex to pRB, indicating that the Cyclin D-Cdk4 complex interacts with pRB.\n\n- **Phosphorylation of pRB**: The interaction between the Cyclin D-Cdk4 complex and pRB implies that the complex phosphorylates pRB, inactivating it and allowing E2F to promote the G1 to S transition.\n\n- **p16 Protein**: A box labeled \"p16\" has an arrow leading to the Cyclin D-Cdk4 complex with a perpendicular line at the end of the arrow. This signifies that p16 inhibits the Cyclin D-Cdk4 complex, thereby preventing it from phosphorylating pRB and keeping pRB active.\n\nBased on the image and the provided information, the proteins encoded by the target genes of E2F are most likely involved in **DNA replication** (Option A), as E2F promotes the G1 to S transition, where DNA replication occurs."
