    "description": "The image shows a Lewis structure representation of an ionic compound. The structure consists of two parts:\n\n1. **[M\u00b2\u207a]**: This part indicates a positively charged ion with a +2 charge. The symbol \"M\" represents an element, and the superscript \"2+\" signifies that this element has lost two electrons, resulting in a positive charge of +2.\n\n2. **[:X:]\u00b2\u207b**: This part indicates a negatively charged ion with a -2 charge. The symbol \"X\" represents another element, and the superscript \"2-\" signifies that this element has gained two electrons, resulting in a negative charge of -2. The dots around \"X\" represent the valence electrons, showing that \"X\" now has a complete octet (8 valence electrons).\n\nSince the charges on both ions are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign (+2 and -2), they will combine in a 1:1 ratio to form a neutral compound. Therefore, the formula of the compound would be MX."
