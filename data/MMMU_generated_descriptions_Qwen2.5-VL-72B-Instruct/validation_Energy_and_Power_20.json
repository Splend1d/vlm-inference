    "question": "The main water line into a tall building has a pressure of 600 kPa at 5 m below ground level, as shown in<image 1>. A pump brings the pressure up so thatnthe water can be delivered at 200 kPa at the top floor 100 m above ground level. Assume a flow rate of 10 kg/s liquid water at 10\u00b0C and neglect any difference in kinetic energy and internal energy u. Find the pump work.",

    "description": "The image depicts a tall building with a water supply system. The building has a height of 150 meters from the ground to the top floor. There is a water main located 5 meters below ground level, which supplies water to the building. A pump is situated near the water main, and it is responsible for increasing the water pressure so that it can reach the top floor of the building.\n\nThe water main has an initial pressure of 600 kPa at the point where it is 5 meters below ground level. The pump boosts this pressure to ensure that the water can be delivered at a pressure of 200 kPa at the top floor, which is 100 meters above ground level. \n\nThe flow rate of the water through the system is given as 10 kg/s, and the temperature of the water is specified as 10\u00b0C. The problem assumes that there are no significant differences in kinetic energy and internal energy (u) within the system. The task is to calculate the work done by the pump (W') under these conditions. The options provided for the pump work are:\n\nA. W' = -6.3 MW  \nB. W' = -7.3 MW  \nC. W' = -9.3 MW  \n\nThe image provides all necessary dimensions and pressures required to solve the problem, including the height differences and the initial and final pressures of the water."
