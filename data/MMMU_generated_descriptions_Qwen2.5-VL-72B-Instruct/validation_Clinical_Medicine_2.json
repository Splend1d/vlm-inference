    "description": "The image shows an electrocardiogram (ECG) with three leads displayed. The top lead shows a regular rhythm with P waves preceding each QRS complex, indicating normal atrial activity. The middle lead displays a series of P waves that appear to occur at a regular interval, but there is no corresponding QRS complex after every P wave. Specifically, there are two P waves followed by a QRS complex, then another two P waves followed by a QRS complex, and this pattern repeats. This suggests a 2:1 conduction ratio. The bottom lead also shows a similar pattern with P waves occurring regularly but not all being conducted to the ventricles.\n\nGiven these observations, the ECG demonstrates a pattern where some atrial impulses fail to conduct to the ventricles in a consistent manner, specifically every other P wave is not followed by a QRS complex. This is indicative of a second-degree atrioventricular block, more specifically, a second-degree type II atrioventricular block, where the P-R interval remains constant before the dropped beat. \n\nTherefore, the most likely diagnosis based on the described ECG is C. Second degree type II atrioventricular block."
