    "description": "The image consists of two diagrams labeled (a) and (b), representing floor plans of gallery layouts. Each diagram shows rectangular rooms connected by doorways, depicted as small vertical lines between the walls of adjacent rooms.\n\n### Diagram (a):\n- There are four rooms arranged in a single row.\n- Each room is connected to its neighboring room(s) by a single doorway.\n- The doorways are located at the midpoints of the shared walls between adjacent rooms.\n- The layout forms a linear sequence where each room connects only to its immediate neighbors.\n\n### Diagram (b):\n- There are six rooms arranged in two rows of three rooms each.\n- Each room in the top row is connected to the corresponding room directly below it in the bottom row by a single doorway.\n- Additionally, each room is connected to its neighboring room(s) within the same row by a single doorway.\n- The doorways are located at the midpoints of the shared walls between adjacent rooms.\n- The layout forms a grid-like structure with connections both horizontally within rows and vertically between rows.\n\nThe task is to determine the minimum number of attendants required to supervise all rooms in each layout by placing them at the doorways connecting adjacent rooms. This involves using integer programming and the simplex method for optimization."
