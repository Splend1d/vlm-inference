    "options": "['Bacterial pathogen', \"I don't know and I don't want to guess\", 'Fungal pathogen', 'Oomycete (watermould) pathogen', 'Physiological condition; no pathogen involved']",

    "description": "The image shows a close-up view of a green leaf with prominent crinkling along its veins. The leaf appears to have a textured surface with visible ridges and grooves running parallel to the main vein. The crinkling is most noticeable along the central vein and extends outward into the smaller veins. There are also some small white specks scattered across the leaf surface, which could be indicative of a physiological condition or a mild infection. The overall appearance suggests that the leaf may be experiencing some form of stress or disease, but there are no clear signs of bacterial, fungal, or oomycete pathogens. The crinkling seems to be more consistent with a physiological condition rather than an infection by a specific pathogen."
