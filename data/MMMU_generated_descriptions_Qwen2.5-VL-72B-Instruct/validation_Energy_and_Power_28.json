    "description": "The image depicts a cylindrical pipe with a radius denoted as \\( R \\). The pipe carries a fluid, specifically air, which flows through it under fully developed laminar conditions. The flow is characterized by a parabolic velocity profile, which is symmetric about the centerline of the pipe. \n\nThe velocity profile is mathematically described by the equation \\( V = V_c \\left[1 - \\left(\\frac{r}{R}\\right)^2\\right] \\), where:\n- \\( V \\) represents the velocity at any radial distance \\( r \\) from the centerline.\n- \\( V_c \\) denotes the maximum velocity, occurring at the centerline (\\( r = 0 \\)).\n- \\( r \\) is the radial distance from the centerline, varying from 0 to \\( R \\).\n- \\( R \\) is the pipe's radius.\n\nThe image also includes a diagram showing the cross-section of the pipe. The centerline is marked with an arrow indicating the direction of flow, and several parallel arrows illustrate the velocity vectors at different radial positions. These vectors are longest at the centerline and gradually shorten as they approach the pipe wall, reflecting the parabolic nature of the velocity profile.\n\nThe question asks for the total mass flow rate (\\( \\dot{m} \\)) and the average velocity (\\( V_{avg} \\)), expressed as functions of \\( V_c \\) and \\( R \\). The options provided include expressions for these quantities involving \\( V_c \\), \\( R \\), and the kinematic viscosity \\( \\nu \\).\n\nTo solve this problem, one would integrate the velocity profile over the cross-sectional area of the pipe to find the total volumetric flow rate and then use the density of air to determine the mass flow rate. The average velocity can be found by dividing the total volumetric flow rate by the cross-sectional area."
