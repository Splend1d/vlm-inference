    "description": "The first image is an architectural floor plan of a large, symmetrical structure with a central dome flanked by two smaller domes and semi-domes. The layout includes a large rectangular nave with aisles on either side, culminating in an apse at one end. There are additional rooms and structures surrounding the main hall, including what appears to be a narthex at the entrance. The design is intricate, with multiple arches and columns indicated, suggesting a grand and complex interior space.\n\nThe second image shows the interior of a monumental building with a vast central dome supported by four massive piers. The walls are adorned with golden mosaics and intricate patterns, and there are numerous windows allowing natural light to flood the space. The architecture features a blend of Byzantine and Islamic elements, with Arabic inscriptions visible on medallions hanging from the walls. The overall impression is one of opulence and grandeur, characteristic of a significant religious or imperial building.\n\nGiven these descriptions, the building depicted is the Hagia Sophia, originally constructed as a Christian church and later converted into a mosque. The patron of this building was Emperor Justinian I, who commissioned its construction in the 6th century. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is:\n\nB. Justinian"
