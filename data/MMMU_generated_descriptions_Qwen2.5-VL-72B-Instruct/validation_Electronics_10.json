    "description": "The image depicts an AC circuit labeled as Fig. 1. The circuit consists of the following components:\n\n- A voltage source with a sinusoidal waveform given by \\( 100 \\cos(377t) \\) volts.\n- Two branches connected in parallel between points 'a' and 'b'.\n  \n**Branch 1:**\n- Contains a capacitor with a capacitance of \\( 10 \\mu F \\).\n- The current through this branch is denoted as \\( I_1 \\).\n\n**Branch 2:**\n- Contains a series combination of:\n  - A resistor with a resistance of \\( 100 \\Omega \\).\n  - An inductor with an inductance of \\( 1H \\).\n- The current through this branch is denoted as \\( I_2 \\).\n\nAdditionally, there is another resistor of \\( 100 \\Omega \\) connected in parallel with Branch 2 but outside the series combination of the resistor and inductor.\n\nThe frequency of the voltage source can be determined from the angular frequency \\( \\omega = 377 \\text{ rad/s} \\), which corresponds to a frequency \\( f = \\frac{\\omega}{2\\pi} \\approx 60 \\text{ Hz} \\).\n\nTo solve for \\( I_1 \\), you need to calculate the impedance of each branch and use Ohm's law and Kirchhoff's laws. The impedance of the capacitor, resistor, and inductor will be used to find the total current and then the individual currents \\( I_1 \\) and \\( I_2 \\). The final value of \\( I_1 \\) should be expressed as a complex number in the form \\( a + jb \\)."
