    "description": "The image depicts a schematic diagram of a pipe system with water flowing upward at a 30-degree angle. The pipe has two labeled points: point (1) and point (2). Point (1) is located lower than point (2), and the distance between these two points along the horizontal direction is 2 meters. A mercury manometer is connected to the pipe between points (1) and (2), showing a height difference \"h\" of 12 cm. The manometer is filled with mercury, which has a density significantly higher than water. The purpose of the manometer is to measure the pressure difference between points (1) and (2) in the pipe. The diagram includes a dashed line indicating the 30-degree angle of inclination for the pipe. The figure is labeled as Fig. P2.35."
