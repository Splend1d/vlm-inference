    "question": "A 31-year-old G2 P1 woman gives birth at 38 weeks gestational age to a male infant. However, the placenta cannot be delivered, and there is extensive hemorrhage. She undergoes emergent hysterectomy, and the gross appearance of the uterus is shown here. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? <image 1> ",
    "options": "['Abruptio placenta', 'Placenta accreta', 'Chorioamnionitis', 'Twin placenta', 'Partial mole']",

    "description": "The image shows a gross specimen of a uterus with an attached placenta. The uterus appears to have a significant portion of its wall missing or eroded, exposing the underlying tissue. The placenta seems to be abnormally adhered to the uterine wall, with no clear demarcation between the placental tissue and the myometrium (the muscular layer of the uterus). There is evidence of bleeding, with blood visible around the area where the placenta is attached. The overall appearance suggests that the placenta has invaded the uterine wall, which is characteristic of a condition known as placenta accreta. \n\nGiven this description, the most likely diagnosis is:\n\nB. Placenta accreta"
