    "description": "The image contains a table with two rows and six columns. The first row represents the variable \\( x \\), and the second row represents the derivative of a function \\( f'(x) \\). The values in the table are as follows:\n\n- For \\( x = -1 \\), \\( f'(x) = 1 \\)\n- For \\( x = -0.6 \\), \\( f'(x) = 2 \\)\n- For \\( x = -0.2 \\), \\( f'(x) = -0.5 \\)\n- For \\( x = 0.2 \\), \\( f'(x) = -1.5 \\)\n- For \\( x = 0.6 \\), \\( f'(x) = 1.2 \\)\n\nAdditionally, it is given that \\( f(-1) = 1.5 \\). The task is to use Euler's method with a step size of 0.8 to approximate \\( f(0.6) \\).\n\nEuler's method formula is:\n\\[ f(x + h) \\approx f(x) + h \\cdot f'(x) \\]\n\nStarting from \\( x = -1 \\) and \\( f(-1) = 1.5 \\), we take steps of size 0.8 until we reach \\( x = 0.6 \\).\n\n1. First step: From \\( x = -1 \\) to \\( x = -0.2 \\)\n   \\[ f(-0.2) \\approx f(-1) + 0.8 \\cdot f'(-1) = 1.5 + 0.8 \\cdot 1 = 1.5 + 0.8 = 2.3 \\]\n\n2. Second step: From \\( x = -0.2 \\) to \\( x = 0.6 \\)\n   \\[ f(0.6) \\approx f(-0.2) + 0.8 \\cdot f'(-0.2) = 2.3 + 0.8 \\cdot (-0.5) = 2.3 - 0.4 = 1.9 \\]\n\nTherefore, the resulting approximation for \\( f(0.6) \\) is \\( 1.9 \\).\n\nThe correct answer is A. 1.9."
