Over the years, they have established the following probability distribution. Let X = the number of years a new hire will stay with the company. Let P(x) = the probability that a new hire will stay with the company x years. P(x = 4) = _______",

    "description": "The image displays a table representing a probability distribution for the number of years a new hire will stay with a company. The table has two columns: one labeled \"x\" and the other labeled \"P(x).\" \n\n- The \"x\" column lists the number of years a new hire stays with the company, ranging from 0 to 6.\n- The \"P(x)\" column lists the corresponding probabilities for each value of x.\n\nHere are the values provided in the table:\n\n| x | P(x) |\n|---|------|\n| 0 | 0.12 |\n| 1 | 0.18 |\n| 2 | 0.30 |\n| 3 | 0.15 |\n| 4 |      |\n| 5 | 0.10 |\n| 6 | 0.05 |\n\nThe probability for x = 4 is missing in the table. To find P(x = 4), you would need to use the fact that the sum of all probabilities in a probability distribution must equal 1. Therefore, you can calculate P(x = 4) by subtracting the sum of the given probabilities from 1."
