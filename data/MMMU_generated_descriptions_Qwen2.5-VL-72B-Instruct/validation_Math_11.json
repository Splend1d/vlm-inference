    "description": "The image shows a graph of a function labeled as \\( f(x) = x^2 - 6x + 4 \\). The graph is a parabola that opens upwards, indicating that it has a minimum point. The vertex of the parabola appears to be below the x-axis, and the curve extends upwards on both sides, approaching positive infinity as \\( x \\) moves towards negative and positive infinity. The general shape of the curve is U-shaped, which is characteristic of a convex function. There are no inflection points or changes in curvature visible on the graph. The function is consistently curving upwards throughout its domain."
