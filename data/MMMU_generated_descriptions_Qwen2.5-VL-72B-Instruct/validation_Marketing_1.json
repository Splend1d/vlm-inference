    "description": "The image displays a table labeled \"Table 12.13,\" which contains data organized into three columns, each representing a group of men from different areas of the country. The table has five rows of numerical values under each group, indicating the weights of the men in each group. Here's the detailed breakdown:\n\n- **Group 1** (Column 1): Contains the following weights: 216, 198, 240, 187, and 176.\n- **Group 2** (Column 2): Contains the following weights: 202, 213, 284, 228, and 210.\n- **Group 3** (Column 3): Contains the following weights: 170, 165, 182, 197, and 201.\n\nEach group has five entries, making a total of fifteen data points across all three groups. The question asks for the calculation of the Mean Square Factor using this data."
