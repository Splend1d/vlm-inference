    "question": "An excursion company is considering adding small boats to their fleet. The company has $200,000 to invest in this venture. At present there is an estimated maximum demand of 6,000 customers per season for these tours. The company does not wish to provide capacity in excess of the estimated maximum demand. The basic data are given below for the two types of available boats. The company will make an estimated seasonal profit of $4,000 for each boat of Type 1 and $7,000 for each boat of Type 2. How many boats of each type should the company use to maximize profit?

    "description": "The image is a graphical representation of a linear programming problem aimed at maximizing profit for a company considering purchasing two types of boats: Type 1 and Type 2. The axes represent the number of boats of each type:\n\n- The x-axis represents the number of Type 1 boats (x\u2081).\n- The y-axis represents the number of Type 2 boats (x\u2082).\n\nThe feasible region is defined by constraints represented by straight lines:\n\n1. **Investment Constraint**: The line \\(25,000x_1 + 80,000x_2 \\leq 200,000\\) indicates the budget limit of $200,000.\n2. **Demand Constraint**: The line \\(1,200x_1 + 2,000x_2 \\leq 6,000\\) represents the maximum customer demand of 6,000 per season.\n\nThe objective function, which aims to maximize profit, is given by \\(f(x) = 4,000x_1 + 7,000x_2\\). This function is represented by a dashed line that moves parallel to itself as the profit increases.\n\nThe feasible region is the area where all constraints intersect, forming a polygon with vertices labeled as (7), (11), (15), and (19). The optimal solution occurs at one of these vertices.\n\nAt vertex (15), the coordinates are approximately \\(x_1 = 4\\) and \\(x_2 = 1\\). This point lies within the feasible region and maximizes the objective function.\n\nTherefore, the optimal solution is to purchase 4 boats of Type 1 and 1 boat of Type 2."
