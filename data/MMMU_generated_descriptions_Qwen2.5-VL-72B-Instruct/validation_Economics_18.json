    "description": "The image is a graph depicting two Long-Run Aggregate Supply (LRAS) curves for Brazil, labeled as LRAS1 and LRAS2. The x-axis represents Real GDP, ranging from 0 to 1200 units, while the y-axis represents the Price Level, also ranging from 0 to 1200 units. \n\nLRAS1 is depicted as a vertical line at the 300 unit mark on the Real GDP axis, indicating that the economy's potential output is fixed at this level regardless of the price level. LRAS2 is shown as another vertical line further to the right, at approximately the 600 unit mark on the Real GDP axis. This suggests an increase in the economy's potential output.\n\nThe shift from LRAS1 to LRAS2 indicates an expansion in the long-run productive capacity of the Brazilian economy. This type of shift typically occurs due to factors that enhance the economy's ability to produce goods and services, such as an increase in capital, improvements in technology, or enhancements in human capital. A decrease in labor or human capital would generally lead to a contraction in the economy's productive capacity, shifting the LRAS curve to the left rather than to the right. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is:\n\nA. Increase in capital."
