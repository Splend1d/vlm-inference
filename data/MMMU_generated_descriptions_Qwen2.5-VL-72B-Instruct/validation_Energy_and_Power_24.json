    "description": "The image depicts a multi-effect forward feed evaporator system consisting of three stages labeled as 1, 2, and 3. The process flow is as follows:\n\n- **Stage 1:** Steam enters at the top of stage 1, providing heat for evaporation. The condensate exits from the bottom of this stage. Feed material is introduced into stage 1.\n  \n- **Stage 2:** The vapor generated in stage 1 moves to stage 2, where it acts as the heating medium. Condensate exits from the bottom of stage 2. The concentrated solution from stage 1 flows into stage 2.\n\n- **Stage 3:** The vapor generated in stage 2 moves to stage 3, acting as the heating medium. Condensate exits from the bottom of stage 3. The concentrated solution from stage 2 flows into stage 3.\n\nEach stage has a heating surface represented by coiled lines inside the stages. The final concentrated product exits from the bottom of stage 3.\n\nIn a forward feed evaporator, the feed enters the first effect (stage 1) and progresses through each subsequent effect (stage 2 and then stage 3), with the final product exiting the last effect. The capacity of the forward feed evaporator is determined by the cumulative evaporation capacity of all stages involved.\n\nTherefore, the capacity of the forward feed evaporator shown in the provided setup is the sum of the evaporation capacities of stages 1, 2, and 3, which corresponds to option A: E1 + E2 + E3."
