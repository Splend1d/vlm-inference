    "description": "The image depicts a fluid mechanics problem involving water flow between two reservoirs connected by a network of pipes. Here's a detailed description:\n\n- **Reservoirs**:\n  - Reservoir (1) is located at an elevation \\( Z_1 = 25 \\) meters.\n  - Reservoir (2) is located at an elevation \\( Z_2 = 0 \\) meters.\n  - The water in both reservoirs is at \\( 20^\\circ \\text{C} \\).\n\n- **Pipe Network**:\n  - All pipes have a diameter of 8 cm and are made of cast iron.\n  - There are three main pipe segments labeled A, B, and C.\n    - Pipe A connects Reservoir (1) to point B. Its length is \\( L_A = 100 \\) meters.\n    - Pipe B extends horizontally from point B to point C. Its length is \\( L_B = 50 \\) meters.\n    - Pipe C extends vertically downward from point C to Reservoir (2). Its length is \\( L_C = 70 \\) meters.\n  \n- **Valve**:\n  - There is a valve at point C with a loss coefficient \\( K_{\\text{valve}} = 0.5 \\).\n  \n- **Additional Dimensions**:\n  - The vertical distance from point B to Reservoir (2) is 30 meters.\n  - The vertical distance from point C to Reservoir (2) is 10 meters.\n\nThe task is to determine the flow rate from Reservoir (1) to Reservoir (2) when the valve at point C is open. The options for the flow rate are:\nA. 0.0174 m\u00b3/s\nB. 0.0126 m\u00b3/s\nC. 0.0152 m\u00b3/s\n\nThis setup involves calculating head losses due to friction and minor losses (including the valve), applying the Darcy-Weisbach equation for frictional losses and using the given valve loss coefficient. The flow rate can then be determined using the energy equation (Bernoulli's equation) considering the total head difference between the two reservoirs."
