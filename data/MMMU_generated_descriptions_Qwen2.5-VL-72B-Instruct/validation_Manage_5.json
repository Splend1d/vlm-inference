    "question": "<image 1> is The process of divergence and convergence, the divergence-convergence process is sequential, divergence precedes convergence, as shown in the figure. You first unfold like a fruiting tree, and then some of the broad changes you produce converge on new, innovative products. Note that many divergent ideas end up going nowhere, so what do critics complain about?",
    "options": "['No need to diverge', 'Disagreement is wasteful and self-indulgent', 'Convergence proceeds too slowly', 'The process of divergence-convergence is of little significance.']",

    "description": "The image is a black-and-white illustration labeled \"Figure 2.16 The process of divergence and convergence.\" It depicts a side profile of a human head with an open cross-section revealing the brain. Inside the brain, there's a complex network of lines and shapes representing neural activity or thought processes.\n\nAt the top of the brain, two labels are prominently displayed: \"CREATIVITY\" and \"DIVERGENT CONVERGENT.\" These terms are connected by lines to various parts within the brain, suggesting their roles in cognitive processes. \n\nOn the left side of the brain, the word \"Arts\" is written, along with the term \"Stereotype,\" indicating a connection between artistic thinking and stereotypes. On the right side, the word \"Science\" is written, also paired with \"Stereotype,\" suggesting a similar relationship between scientific thinking and stereotypes.\n\nThe central part of the brain shows a branching structure resembling a tree, symbolizing the divergence of ideas. This tree-like structure spreads out widely, representing the expansion of thoughts and creativity. Some branches extend outward, while others converge toward a specific point, illustrating the convergence of ideas into a focused outcome.\n\nThe image visually represents the concept that during the creative process, numerous ideas (divergence) are generated, but only a few lead to meaningful results (convergence). Many divergent ideas may not contribute to the final product, which aligns with the notion that critics might view this as wasteful or self-indulgent. \n\nThis visual metaphor supports the idea that divergence precedes convergence, and the process involves generating many ideas before narrowing them down to innovative solutions. The image emphasizes that not all divergent ideas are fruitful, which could lead critics to argue that disagreement or divergence is wasteful and self-indulgent. Therefore, the correct answer to the question would be B. Disagreement is wasteful and self-indulgent."
