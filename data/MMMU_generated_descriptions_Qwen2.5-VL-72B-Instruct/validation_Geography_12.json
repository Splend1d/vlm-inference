    "description": "The image consists of two main parts: a map and a photograph. \n\nThe map shows a section of the Pacific Ocean with various annotations and labels. It highlights an area labeled \"Extinct volcano\" and another labeled \"Volcano F.\" There are also several lines and arrows indicating movement or flow, which seem to represent different phenomena over time. Specifically, there are labels for \"8 August eruption,\" \"Dispersed water (9 Aug),\" \"Pumice raft (10 Aug),\" and \"Pumice raft (14 Aug).\" The pumice raft's position changes from one location on August 10th to another on August 14th. The map includes a legend that explains these labels and their corresponding colors. Additionally, there are arrows pointing in various directions, suggesting movement caused by external forces.\n\nThe photograph shows a person standing on a boat, looking out at the ocean. The ocean appears calm, with no significant waves visible. The person seems to be observing something in the distance, possibly related to the pumice raft mentioned on the map.\n\nBased on the map and the photograph, it is evident that the pumice raft changed position between August 8th and August 14th. The arrows on the map suggest that this movement was influenced by external forces. Given the context of the ocean environment and the lack of significant waves in the photograph, the most likely cause of the pumice raft's movement is ocean currents. Therefore, the direct cause of the pumice raft to change position between 8 and 14 August is A. ocean currents."
