    "description": "The image depicts a precedence graph with three transactions: \\( T_1 \\), \\( T_2 \\), and \\( T_3 \\). The graph shows the dependencies between these transactions through directed edges, indicating the order in which operations must occur to avoid conflicts.\n\n- **Transaction \\( T_1 \\)**:\n  - Reads from variable \\( Y \\).\n  - Writes to variable \\( X \\).\n\n- **Transaction \\( T_2 \\)**:\n  - Reads from variable \\( X \\) (which was written by \\( T_1 \\)).\n  - Writes to variable \\( Y \\).\n\n- **Transaction \\( T_3 \\)**:\n  - Reads from variable \\( Y \\) (which was written by \\( T_2 \\)).\n  - Writes to variables \\( Y \\) and \\( Z \\).\n\nThe directed edges in the graph represent the following dependencies:\n\n1. An edge from \\( T_1 \\) to \\( T_2 \\): This indicates that \\( T_2 \\) must follow \\( T_1 \\) because \\( T_2 \\) reads from \\( X \\), which is written by \\( T_1 \\).\n2. An edge from \\( T_2 \\) to \\( T_3 \\): This indicates that \\( T_3 \\) must follow \\( T_2 \\) because \\( T_3 \\) reads from \\( Y \\), which is written by \\( T_2 \\).\n\nBased on these dependencies, the transactions must be executed in the order \\( T_1 \\rightarrow T_2 \\rightarrow T_3 \\) to ensure that all read operations see the correct values written by previous transactions. Therefore, the correct serial schedule is \\( T_1 \\rightarrow T_2 \\rightarrow T_3 \\)."
