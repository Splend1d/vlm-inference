    "description": "The image presents a simplified balance sheet for TD Bank with two main sections: Assets and Liabilities. \n\nUnder **Assets**, there are two items listed:\n- Reserves: $493\n- Loans: $2407\n\nUnder **Liabilities**, there is one item listed:\n- Deposits: $2900\n\nThis balance sheet indicates that TD Bank has total assets of $2900 ($493 in reserves + $2407 in loans), which matches its total liabilities of $2900 (deposits). The balance sheet is balanced, meaning assets equal liabilities.\n\nThe question asks about the effect of an additional deposit of $700 into TD Bank on the money supply. To determine the minimum increase in the money supply, consider that when a bank receives a new deposit, it can lend out a portion of it while keeping some as reserves. The exact amount it can lend depends on the reserve requirement ratio, but the question asks for the *minimum* increase in the money supply.\n\nGiven that the bank must keep some reserves, the minimum increase in the money supply would occur if the entire $700 were kept as reserves and not lent out. Therefore, the minimum increase in the money supply is simply the amount of the new deposit, which is $700. \n\nThus, the correct answer is B. 700."
