    "question": "Ammonia reacts with oxygen to yield nitrogen and water,<image 1>,Given this chemical equation, as well as the number of moles of the reactant or product indicated below, determine the number of moles of all remaining reactants and products:. 3.0 mol O2",
    "options": "['4.0 mol of NH3,3.0 mol of N2,6.0 mol of H2O', '4.0 mol of NH3,1.0 mol of N2,6.0 mol of H2O', '4.0 mol of NH3,2.0 mol of N2,6.0 mol of H2O']",

    "description": "The image displays a balanced chemical equation for the reaction between ammonia (NH\u2083) and oxygen (O\u2082) to produce nitrogen gas (N\u2082) and liquid water (H\u2082O). The equation is written as follows:\n\n\\[ 4 \\text{NH}_3(g) + 3 \\text{O}_2(g) \\longrightarrow 2 \\text{N}_2(g) + 6 \\text{H}_2\\text{O}(l) \\]\n\nThis indicates that 4 moles of ammonia gas react with 3 moles of oxygen gas to produce 2 moles of nitrogen gas and 6 moles of liquid water. The coefficients in front of each compound represent the stoichiometric ratios of the reactants and products involved in the reaction."
