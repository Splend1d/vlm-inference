    "description": "The image shows a woman wearing a short-sleeved dress with a flared skirt. The dress features an intricate, symmetrical pattern consisting of various shades of green, white, and black. The design includes stylized floral motifs and abstract shapes that are evenly distributed across the fabric. The pattern appears to be mirrored along the vertical axis of the dress, creating a sense of balance. The woman's pose is neutral, standing straight with her arms at her sides, which further emphasizes the symmetry of the dress. The background is plain white, ensuring that the focus remains on the dress and its design. The overall effect is one of harmony and equilibrium, achieved through the careful arrangement of the pattern elements."
