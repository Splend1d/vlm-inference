    "question": "What kind of tissue does this image depict?  <image 1> ",
    "options": "['Cardiac muscle', 'Skeletal muscle', 'Cartliage']",
    "id": "validation_Basic_Medical_Science_11",
    "description": "The image shows a histological section stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). The tissue appears to have long, cylindrical cells arranged in parallel bundles. Each cell has an elongated shape with a single, centrally located nucleus. The nuclei are oval-shaped and appear darker due to the staining. The cytoplasm of the cells is stained pink, indicating the presence of actin and myosin filaments. There are visible striations along the length of the cells, which are characteristic of muscle tissue. The overall structure suggests a highly organized arrangement typical of muscle fibers. \n\nGiven these characteristics, the tissue depicted in the image is most consistent with skeletal muscle. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is B. Skeletal muscle."
