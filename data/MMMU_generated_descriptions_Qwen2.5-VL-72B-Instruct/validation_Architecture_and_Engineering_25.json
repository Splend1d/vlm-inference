    "question": "A road is being proposed to facilitate a housing development on a scenic lake. Two alternatives have been suggested. One of the roadway alignments is to go around the lake  and slightly impact a wetland. The second alternative will also go around the lake and  will significantly impact two wetlands. The following table shows the anticipated costs  for each alternative. Assuming that the annual interestrate is 7 percent, determine which alternative is preferred using equivalent annual cost analysis.<image 1>",
    "options": "['EUAW1=$18,444, EUAW2=$19,730', 'EUAW1=$18,444, EUAW2=$15,730', 'EUAW1=$15,444, EUAW2=$19,730']",

    "description": "The image presents a table comparing two alternative roadway alignment options (I and II) for a housing development near a scenic lake. The table includes the following columns:\n\n- **Alternative:** Lists the two options as \"I\" and \"II.\"\n- **First Cost ($):** The initial investment required for each alternative. Alternative I has a first cost of $75,000, while Alternative II has a first cost of $125,000.\n- **Annual Maintenance Cost ($):** The yearly maintenance expenses. Alternative I incurs an annual maintenance cost of $3,000, whereas Alternative II has an annual maintenance cost of $2,000.\n- **Service Life (yr):** The expected lifespan of each alternative in years. Both alternatives have a service life of 15 years.\n- **Salvage Value ($):** The estimated value at the end of the service life. Alternative I has a salvage value of $45,000, and Alternative II has a salvage value of $25,000.\n- **Annual Wetland Costs ($):** The yearly cost associated with impacting wetlands. Alternative I has an annual wetland cost of $7,500, while Alternative II has an annual wetland cost of $2,500.\n- **Annual Lighting Costs ($):** The yearly expense for lighting. Alternative I incurs an annual lighting cost of $1,500, and Alternative II has an annual lighting cost of $2,500.\n\nTo determine the preferred alternative using equivalent annual cost (EAC) analysis, you would calculate the EAC for each option considering the provided data and an annual interest rate of 7%. The EAC combines all costs into an equivalent annual amount over the service life of the project. The alternative with the lower EAC would be preferred."
