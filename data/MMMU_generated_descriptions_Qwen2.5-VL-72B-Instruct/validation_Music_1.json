    "description": "The first image (Image 1) shows a single eighth note with a dot after it. This represents a dotted eighth note.\n\nThe second image (Image 2) displays three eighth notes, each followed by a dot. These are three dotted eighth notes.\n\nThe third image (Image 3) shows three eighth notes, but only the first two have dots after them. The third note does not have a dot.\n\nThe fourth image (Image 4) presents three eighth notes, but only the first one has a dot after it. The other two do not have dots.\n\nThe fifth image (Image 5) depicts three eighth notes, but only the last two have dots after them. The first note does not have a dot.\n\nThe question asks to express the note value of the first image (a single dotted eighth note) using three dotted eighth notes. Therefore, the correct option is the one where all three eighth notes are dotted, which corresponds to Image 2."
