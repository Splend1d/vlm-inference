    "description": "The image is an anatomical illustration of the eye and its surrounding structures, focusing on the extraocular muscles and their connections to the brain. The muscles are labeled with letters for identification. \n\n- Muscle B is located superiorly and laterally in relation to the eyeball. It appears to be the superior oblique muscle, which is known to be innervated by Cranial Nerve IV (Trochlear Nerve). \n- The other muscles are also labeled but are not relevant to answering the specific question about muscle B. \n\nGiven this information, the muscle lettered B is innervated by Cranial Nerve IV."
