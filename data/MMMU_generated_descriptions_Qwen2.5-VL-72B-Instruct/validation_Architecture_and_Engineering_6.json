    "question": "Two consecutive photographs were taken with a camera of focal length 200 mm mounted on an airplane flying at a height of 1500 m. The overlap was exactly 60% and the size of prints was 250 mm 250 mm. The flying height was same in case of both the exposures and the flight was balanced so that there was no drift. The ground was flat and was 250 m above the mean sea level. Determine the scale of the photograph and the length of the air base.<image 1>",
    "options": "['The scale of the photographs is 1 cm = 62.5 m;Air base = 625 m', 'The scale of the photographs is 1 cm = 68.5 m;Air base = 625 m', 'The scale of the photographs is 1 cm = 66.5 m;Air base = 625 m', 'The scale of the photographs is 1 cm = 64.5 m;Air base = 625 m']",

    "description": "The image illustrates a diagram related to photogrammetry, specifically depicting the geometry of aerial photography. It shows two overlapping photographs taken from an airplane, forming a stereo pair. The diagram includes the following elements:\n\n- **Air Base**: This is the horizontal distance between the positions of the camera when the two consecutive photographs were taken. In the diagram, it is shown as the distance between the two points directly below the camera positions on the ground.\n  \n- **Overlap**: The diagram indicates that the overlap between the two photographs is 60%. This means that 60% of the second photograph overlaps with the first photograph. The overlap is visually represented by the shaded area where the two triangles intersect.\n\n- **Ground Dimensions**: The total ground length covered by the two photographs is labeled as \\( L \\). The diagram divides this length into two segments: 0.4L and 0.6L. The 0.6L segment represents the part of the second photograph that overlaps with the first photograph, while the 0.4L segment represents the new ground coverage by the second photograph.\n\n- **Camera Positions**: Two arrows at the top of the diagram represent the positions of the camera when the photographs were taken. These arrows point downward toward the ground, indicating the direction of the camera's view.\n\n- **Scale and Proportions**: The diagram does not provide specific numerical values for the lengths but uses proportions (0.4L and 0.6L) to describe the relationship between the overlapping and non-overlapping parts of the photographs.\n\nGiven the information in the question and the diagram, the scale of the photograph can be calculated using the formula:\n\\[ \\text{Scale} = \\frac{\\text{Focal Length}}{\\text{Flying Height - Ground Elevation}} \\]\nSubstituting the given values:\n\\[ \\text{Scale} = \\frac{200 \\text{ mm}}{1500 \\text{ m} - 250 \\text{ m}} = \\frac{200 \\text{ mm}}{1250 \\text{ m}} = \\frac{1}{6250} \\]\nThis means the scale is 1 cm = 62.5 m.\n\nThe length of the air base can be calculated using the formula for the air base in terms of the ground base and the scale:\n\\[ \\text{Air Base} = \\text{Ground Base} \\times \\text{Scale} \\]\nSince the ground base is 0.4L and the scale is 1/6250, the air base is:\n\\[ \\text{Air Base} = 0.4L \\times 6250 = 625 \\text{ m} \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nA. The scale of the photographs is 1 cm = 62.5 m; Air base = 625 m."
