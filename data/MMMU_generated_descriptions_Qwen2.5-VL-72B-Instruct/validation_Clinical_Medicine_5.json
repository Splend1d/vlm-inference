    "description": "The image provided is an abdominal X-ray showing a cluster of irregularly shaped, dense white structures located in the upper right quadrant of the abdomen. These structures vary in size and shape but generally appear rounded or oval. They are situated near the region where the gallbladder would typically be found. The surrounding soft tissues and bony structures, such as the ribs and spine, are visible but do not obscure the dense objects. There is no evidence of other abnormalities like pancreatic calcifications, which would typically appear more linear or branching, nor are there signs of a calcified hematoma or aneurysm, which would have different shapes and locations. The dense objects are consistent with the appearance of gallstones on an X-ray."
