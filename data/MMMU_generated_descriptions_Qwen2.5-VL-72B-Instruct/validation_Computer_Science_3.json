    "question": "In the scenario below, imagine that you're sending an http request to another machine somewhere on the network. <image 1> What layer in the IP stack best corresponds to the phrase: 'moves datagrams from the source host to the destination host'",
    "options": "['Application Layer', 'Transport Layer', 'Network Layer', 'Link Layer', 'Physical Layer']",

    "description": "The image illustrates the process of data transmission through various layers of the OSI model, specifically focusing on the IP stack. On the left side of the image, there is a vertical column labeled with five layers: Application, Transport, Network, Link, and Physical. These represent the different levels at which data is processed during transmission.\n\nOn the right side of the image, two computers (labeled \"Source\" and \"Destination\") are connected via a network infrastructure that includes a switch and a router. The data flow is depicted using arrows and blocks representing data packets at each layer.\n\nAt the Source computer:\n- The Application layer processes the initial message.\n- The Transport layer divides the message into segments and adds transport headers (Ht).\n- The Network layer further divides the segments into datagrams, adding network headers (Hn) and a sequence number (e.g., 4).\n- The Link layer encapsulates the datagrams for transmission over the physical medium.\n- The Physical layer transmits the data as bits over the physical connection.\n\nThe data then travels through the network infrastructure:\n- The switch forwards the data based on the link-layer address.\n- The router routes the data based on the network-layer address, moving it from the source host to the destination host.\n\nAt the Destination computer:\n- The Physical layer receives the bits.\n- The Link layer processes the encapsulated datagrams.\n- The Network layer removes the network headers and reassembles the datagrams (e.g., sequence number 12).\n- The Transport layer reassembles the segments and removes the transport headers.\n- The Application layer receives the complete message.\n\nGiven this detailed description, the layer in the IP stack that best corresponds to the phrase \"moves datagrams from the source host to the destination host\" is the **Network Layer**. This is because the Network Layer is responsible for routing and forwarding datagrams across different networks, ensuring they reach the correct destination host. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Network Layer"
