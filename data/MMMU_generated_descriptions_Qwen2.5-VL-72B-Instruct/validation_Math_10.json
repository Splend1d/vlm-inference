    "description": "The image depicts an undirected graph with eight labeled vertices: \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), \\(d\\), \\(e\\), \\(f\\), \\(g\\), and \\(h\\). The connections between these vertices are represented by lines (edges) connecting them. Here's a detailed breakdown of the connections:\n\n- Vertex \\(a\\) is connected to vertices \\(b\\), \\(d\\), and \\(e\\).\n- Vertex \\(b\\) is connected to vertices \\(a\\), \\(c\\), \\(e\\), and \\(h\\).\n- Vertex \\(c\\) is connected to vertices \\(b\\), \\(d\\), \\(f\\), and \\(h\\).\n- Vertex \\(d\\) is connected to vertices \\(a\\), \\(c\\), and \\(e\\).\n- Vertex \\(e\\) is connected to vertices \\(a\\), \\(d\\), and \\(f\\).\n- Vertex \\(f\\) is connected to vertices \\(c\\), \\(e\\), and \\(g\\).\n- Vertex \\(g\\) is connected to vertex \\(f\\).\n- Vertex \\(h\\) is connected to vertices \\(b\\) and \\(c\\).\n\nFrom this description, we can determine the degree of each vertex:\n- Degree of \\(a\\): 3 (connected to \\(b\\), \\(d\\), and \\(e\\))\n- Degree of \\(b\\): 4 (connected to \\(a\\), \\(c\\), \\(e\\), and \\(h\\))\n- Degree of \\(c\\): 4 (connected to \\(b\\), \\(d\\), \\(f\\), and \\(h\\))\n- Degree of \\(d\\): 3 (connected to \\(a\\), \\(c\\), and \\(e\\))\n- Degree of \\(e\\): 3 (connected to \\(a\\), \\(d\\), and \\(f\\))\n- Degree of \\(f\\): 3 (connected to \\(c\\), \\(e\\), and \\(g\\))\n- Degree of \\(g\\): 1 (connected to \\(f\\))\n- Degree of \\(h\\): 2 (connected to \\(b\\) and \\(c\\))\n\nThis graph is not a regular graph because not all vertices have the same degree. Specifically, vertices \\(a\\), \\(d\\), \\(e\\), and \\(f\\) have degree 3, vertices \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) have degree 4, vertex \\(g\\) has degree 1, and vertex \\(h\\) has degree 2. Therefore, the correct answer is C. not all vertices have the same degree."
