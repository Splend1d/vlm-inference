    "options": "['Mineral deficiency', 'Nematode attack', \"Don't know and don't want to guess\", 'There is no problem', 'Pot bound']",
    "id": "validation_Agriculture_4",
    "description": "The image shows a young citrus tree placed on a white sheet of paper, which is laid on a wooden surface. The tree has a visible root system that appears to be tightly coiled and intertwined, suggesting that the roots have grown in a confined space and have started to circle around themselves. The leaves of the tree are green and appear healthy, with no visible signs of discoloration or damage that would indicate a mineral deficiency or nematode attack. There is no indication of the tree being potted, so it cannot be determined if it is pot-bound in its current state. However, the coiled roots suggest that it may have been previously pot-bound before being removed from its container. \n\nBased on the description, the issue with the young citrus tree seems to be related to its root system, which appears to have grown in a confined space, leading to coiled and intertwined roots. This suggests that the correct answer to the question is:\n\nE. Pot bound"
