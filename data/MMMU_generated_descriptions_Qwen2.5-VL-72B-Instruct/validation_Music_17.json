    "description": "The image consists of two main sections:\n\n1. The first section shows a musical staff with five lines and four spaces. On this staff, there are six notes placed at different positions:\n   - The first note is a flat (\u266d) symbol followed by an open note head on the bottom line.\n   - The second note is an open note head on the second line from the bottom.\n   - The third note is a flat (\u266d) symbol followed by an open note head on the third line from the bottom.\n   - The fourth note is a flat (\u266d) symbol followed by an open note head on the top line.\n   - The fifth note is an open note head in the space between the fourth and fifth lines.\n   - The sixth note is a flat (\u266d) symbol followed by an open note head on the top line.\n\n2. The second section shows four different clefs:\n   - The first clef is a treble clef (G-clef).\n   - The second clef is a bass clef (F-clef).\n   - The third clef is an alto clef (C-clef), which is also known as a viola clef.\n   - The fourth clef is a tenor clef (C-clef), which is similar to the alto clef but positioned differently on the staff.\n\nTo determine which clef forms a minor scale with the given notes, you would need to consider the placement of the notes relative to each clef and identify if they form a minor scale pattern."
