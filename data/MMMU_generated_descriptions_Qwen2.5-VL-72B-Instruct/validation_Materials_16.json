    "description": "The image depicts a high-strength precast concrete column with two sections, labeled as Section \\(a-a\\) and Section \\(b-b\\). The column is divided into three segments: \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\).\n\n### Column Segments:\n- **Segment \\(A-B\\):**\n  - Length: 10 feet.\n  - Cross-section at Section \\(a-a\\): A square with dimensions 6 inches by 6 inches.\n  - Two forces \\(P_1\\) act downward at the top of this segment (at point \\(A\\)).\n\n- **Segment \\(B-C\\):**\n  - Length: 10 feet.\n  - Cross-section at Section \\(b-b\\): A square with dimensions 10 inches by 10 inches.\n  - Two forces \\(P_2\\) act downward at the top of this segment (at point \\(B\\)).\n\n### Forces:\n- At point \\(A\\), there are two equal forces \\(P_1\\) acting downward.\n- At point \\(B\\), there are two equal forces \\(P_2\\) acting downward.\n\n### Vertical Displacements:\n- The vertical displacement of end \\(A\\) relative to \\(B\\) is given as 0.08 inches.\n- The vertical displacement of end \\(B\\) relative to \\(C\\) is given as 0.1 inches.\n\n### Material Properties:\n- The material is high-strength precast concrete, but specific material properties like Young's modulus or density are not provided in the image.\n\n### Question Context:\nThe question asks for the magnitude of \\(P_1\\) given the specified vertical displacements between points \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), and between points \\(B\\) and \\(C\\). The options provided for \\(P_1\\) are:\n- A. 58.4 kip\n- B. 125 kip\n- C. 50.4 kip\n- D. 100 kip\n\nThis description should enable solving for \\(P_1\\) using principles of structural mechanics, considering the given displacements and geometry of the column."
