    "options": "['The capital of West Germany was located in East Germany', 'West Germany experienced a postwar economic miracle', 'Both East Germany and West Germany were allowed to rearm', 'France had occupied West Germany']",

    "description": "The image is a grayscale political map of Europe during the Cold War era. The map highlights several countries with their respective names labeled. Notably, Germany is depicted as being divided into two distinct entities: **East Germany** and **West Germany**. \n\n- **East Germany** is shown as part of the Soviet sphere of influence, shaded darker than other countries, indicating its alignment with the Eastern Bloc.\n- **West Germany** is shaded lighter, signifying its association with Western European nations and NATO.\n- The capital city of **Berlin** is marked within East Germany but is further divided into sectors, reflecting its unique status as a divided city.\n- The label \"BONN\" appears within the territory of West Germany, indicating it as the capital of West Germany during this period.\n- Surrounding countries like France, Italy, and others are also labeled and shaded accordingly, showing their positions relative to the divided Germany.\n- The map does not provide any information about economic conditions or military policies of the countries.\n\nBased on the map's depiction:\n- Option A is incorrect because Bonn, the capital of West Germany, is clearly located within West Germany, not East Germany.\n- Options B, C, and D cannot be confirmed or denied from the map alone, as the map does not provide information about economic miracles, rearmament policies, or occupation by France."
