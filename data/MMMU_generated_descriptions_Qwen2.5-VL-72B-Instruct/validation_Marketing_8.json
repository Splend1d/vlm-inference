    "description": "The image displays two bar graphs labeled (a) and (b), both titled \"Figure 2.25.\" Each graph has five bars corresponding to values on the x-axis labeled 1 through 5. \n\n- **Graph (a):** \n  - The heights of the bars from left to right are approximately: \n    - Bar 1: lowest height\n    - Bar 2: slightly higher than Bar 1\n    - Bar 3: highest height\n    - Bar 4: slightly lower than Bar 3\n    - Bar 5: similar in height to Bar 2\n\n- **Graph (b):**\n  - The heights of the bars from left to right are approximately:\n    - Bar 1: relatively high but not the highest\n    - Bar 2: slightly lower than Bar 1\n    - Bar 3: lowest height\n    - Bar 4: similar in height to Bar 2\n    - Bar 5: highest height\n\nBoth graphs have a y-axis with gridlines indicating relative heights, but no numerical labels are provided for the y-axis. The visual comparison suggests that the distribution of heights differs between the two graphs."
