    "description": "The image depicts a finite state machine (FSM) diagram with two states. \n\n- The first state is represented by a circle labeled \"s\" enclosed within a dotted oval, indicating it is part of a loop.\n- There is an arrow pointing from outside the FSM into this \"s\" state, labeled with the symbol \u03b5 (epsilon), which typically represents an empty or null transition in formal language theory.\n- Another arrow loops back from the \"s\" state to itself, also labeled with \u03b5, suggesting that the machine can remain in this state without consuming any input.\n- A second state is depicted as a simple circle, connected by an arrow originating from the \"s\" state and labeled \u03b5, indicating a transition to this new state without consuming input.\n- An additional arrow points from outside the FSM directly to this second state, also labeled \u03b5.\n\nThis structure implies that the machine can either stay in the \"s\" state indefinitely through \u03b5-transitions or move to the second state via another \u03b5-transition. The presence of the loop around \"s\" suggests repetition, while the \u03b5-transitions indicate optional transitions that do not consume input symbols. Therefore, the structure corresponds to the Kleene star operation, denoted as \"s*\", meaning zero or more occurrences of \"s\"."
