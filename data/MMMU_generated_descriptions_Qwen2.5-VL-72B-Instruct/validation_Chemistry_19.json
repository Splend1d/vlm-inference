    "description": "The image shows the structural formula of an amino acid. The molecule has a positively charged ammonium group (NH\u2083\u207a) attached to a central carbon atom. This central carbon is also bonded to a hydrogen atom (H), a carboxylate group (COO\u207b), and another carbon chain. \n\nThe carbon chain extends from the central carbon as follows: it first connects to a carbon atom that is bonded to two hydrogen atoms and a methyl group (CH\u2083). This carbon then connects to another carbon atom with two hydrogen atoms and a final methyl group (CH\u2083).\n\nThe central carbon atom, which is bonded to four different groups (NH\u2083\u207a, H, COO\u207b, and the carbon chain), is a chiral center. The presence of this chiral center indicates that the molecule can exist in two non-superimposable mirror images, known as optical isomers or enantiomers. Therefore, based on the structure provided, isoleucine has **two** optical isomers."
