    "question": "A 45-year-old man complains of a severe, constant headache for the past 2 days. He is noted on physical examination to have papilledema on the right. He becomes obtunded. The representative gross pathologic appearance of a complication in this man is shown here. Which of the following conditions is most likely to produce this gross finding? <image 1> ",
    "options": "['Parkinson disease', 'Berry aneurysm rupture', 'Glioblastoma', 'Multiple sclerosis', 'Meningococcemia']",

    "description": "The image shows a cross-sectional view of a brain with a significant abnormality. The brain tissue appears to have a large, irregularly shaped cavity filled with dark material, indicative of hemorrhage or necrosis. Surrounding the cavity, there is a thickened, disorganized layer of tissue with concentric rings, resembling a laminated structure. This appearance is characteristic of a mass lesion that has undergone central necrosis and hemorrhage. \n\nBelow the brain section, there is a metric ruler indicating the size of the specimen. The ruler suggests that the diameter of the cavity is approximately 3-4 centimeters. The overall appearance of the brain section is consistent with a malignant tumor that has caused significant damage to the surrounding brain tissue, leading to necrosis and hemorrhage.\n\nGiven the clinical presentation described in the question\u2014severe headache, papilledema, and obtundation\u2014the most likely condition producing this gross finding is C. Glioblastoma. Glioblastomas are aggressive brain tumors that can cause central necrosis and hemorrhage, leading to increased intracranial pressure and the symptoms mentioned. The other options listed (Parkinson disease, Berry aneurysm rupture, Multiple sclerosis, and Meningococcemia) do not typically present with this specific gross pathologic appearance."
