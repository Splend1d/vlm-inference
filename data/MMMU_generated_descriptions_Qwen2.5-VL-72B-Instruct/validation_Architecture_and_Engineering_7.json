    "description": "The image presents a table with information about the materials used in an asphalt paving mixture. The table has three columns: \"Material,\" \"Specific Gravity,\" and \"Mix Composition by Weight of Total Mix.\" \n\nIn the \"Material\" column, four types of materials are listed:\n1. Asphalt cement\n2. Coarse aggregate\n3. Fine aggregate\n4. Mineral filler\n\nThe \"Specific Gravity\" column provides the specific gravity values for each material:\n- Asphalt cement: 1.02\n- Coarse aggregate: 2.51\n- Fine aggregate: 2.74\n- Mineral filler: 2.69\n\nThe \"Mix Composition by Weight of Total Mix\" column gives the percentage composition of each material in the total mix:\n- Asphalt cement: 6.40%\n- Coarse aggregate: 52.35%\n- Fine aggregate: 33.45%\n- Mineral filler: 7.80%\n\nAdditionally, it is mentioned that the maximum specific gravity of the mixture is 2.41 and the bulk specific gravity is 2.35. The task is to determine the bulk specific gravity of aggregates in the mix from the given options: A. 2.603, B. 2.703, C. 2.803."
