    "description": "The image shows a musical notation in 3/4 time signature. The key signature indicates one sharp, suggesting the key of G major or E minor. The melody begins with a quarter note (crotchet) on the second line from the bottom of the staff, followed by two eighth notes (quavers). These two eighth notes are enclosed within a bracket, indicating an ornament. The first eighth note is a step below the main note, and the second eighth note returns to the main note. This pattern suggests a specific type of ornamentation. The subsequent notes include a dotted quarter note (dotted crotchet) and a sharp accidental applied to the final note."
