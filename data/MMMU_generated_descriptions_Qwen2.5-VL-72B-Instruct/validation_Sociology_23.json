    "options": "['Corporate crime', 'Violent crime', 'Victimless crime', 'All of the above']",
    "id": "validation_Sociology_23",
    "description": "The image shows a close-up view of a yellow caution tape with bold black lettering that reads \"CRIME SCENE DO NOT CROSS.\" The tape is stretched across the frame, partially obscuring a background that includes trees and a bright light source, possibly the sun, shining through the foliage. The focus is on the tape, which is commonly used by law enforcement to cordon off areas where crimes have occurred, indicating the presence of a crime scene. The setting suggests an outdoor environment, likely during the daytime given the sunlight. The image does not provide specific details about the nature of the crime or the type of criminal activity involved."
