    "description": "The image depicts a directed graph with eight nodes labeled from 'a' to 'h'. Each node has two numbers associated with it in the format \"x / y\", representing the discovery time (x) and finishing time (y) during a Depth First Search (DFS). The edges between the nodes indicate the direction of traversal.\n\nHere's a detailed breakdown:\n\n- Node 'a': Discovery time = 13, Finishing time = 14.\n- Node 'b': Discovery time = 11, Finishing time = 16.\n- Node 'c': Discovery time = 1, Finishing time = 10.\n- Node 'd': Discovery time = 8, Finishing time = 9.\n- Node 'e': Discovery time = 12, Finishing time = 15.\n- Node 'f': Discovery time = 3, Finishing time = 4.\n- Node 'g': Discovery time = 5, Finishing time = 7.\n- Node 'h': Discovery time = 2, Finishing time = 6.\n\nThe edges and their directions are as follows:\n- There is an edge from 'a' to 'b'.\n- There is an edge from 'b' to 'c'.\n- There is an edge from 'c' to 'd'.\n- There is an edge from 'd' to 'h'.\n- There is an edge from 'h' to 'g'.\n- There is an edge from 'g' to 'f'.\n- There is an edge from 'f' to 'e'.\n- There is an edge from 'e' to 'a'.\n\nBased on the DFS timestamps and the structure of the graph, the depth-first forest can be identified by grouping nodes that share the same DFS traversal path. The correct grouping is:\n\n- Nodes 'a', 'b', and 'e' form one group because they are connected in a cycle through the edges 'a' -> 'b' -> 'e' -> 'a'.\n- Nodes 'f' and 'g' form another group because they are connected through the edge 'g' -> 'f'.\n- Nodes 'c', 'd', and 'h' form a separate group because they are connected through the edges 'c' -> 'd' -> 'h' -> 'g' -> 'f' -> 'e' -> 'a' -> 'b' -> 'c'.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is: C. {a, b, e} {f, g} {c, d} {h}."
