    "description": "The image shows a periodic sawtooth waveform labeled \"Fig. 1.\" The waveform is plotted against time \\( t \\), with the horizontal axis representing \\( t \\) and the vertical axis representing the amplitude of the waveform. \n\nKey features of the waveform:\n- The waveform starts at \\( t = 0 \\) with an amplitude of \\( 0 \\).\n- It increases linearly to reach an amplitude of \\( \\pi \\) at \\( t = \\pi \\).\n- At \\( t = \\pi \\), there is a sudden drop to an amplitude of \\( -\\pi \\).\n- The waveform then increases linearly again to reach \\( \\pi \\) at \\( t = 2\\pi \\).\n- This pattern repeats periodically with a period of \\( 2\\pi \\).\n\nThe waveform has the following characteristics:\n- It is an odd function, meaning it is symmetric about the origin.\n- The amplitude varies between \\( -\\pi \\) and \\( \\pi \\).\n- The waveform has a discontinuity at every integer multiple of \\( \\pi \\).\n\nThe Fourier series for a sawtooth wave with these properties typically includes only sine terms due to its odd symmetry. The general form of the Fourier series for this type of sawtooth wave is:\n\n\\[ f(t) = -\\frac{2}{\\pi} \\left( \\sin(t) + \\frac{1}{2}\\sin(2t) + \\frac{1}{3}\\sin(3t) + \\cdots \\right) \\]\n\nGiven the options provided, the correct Fourier series representation for the sawtooth waveform shown in the image is:\n\nB. \\(-2[\\sin t + (1 / 2) \\sin 2t + (1 / 3) \\sin 3t + ...]\\)\n\nThis matches the general form of the Fourier series for the described sawtooth waveform."
