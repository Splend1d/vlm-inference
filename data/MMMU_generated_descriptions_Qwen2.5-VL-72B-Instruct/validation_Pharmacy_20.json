    "question": "Five elements make up 98% of the mass of the human body. These elements are oxygen (61%), carbon (23%), hydrogen (10.0%), nitrogen (2.6%), and calcium (1.4%). Compare these data with those in the pie graph below, which shows the five most abundant elements by mass in Earth's crust, oceans, and atmosphere. <image 1>,______,______,______,_______,are abundant both in the human body and Earth's crust, oceans, and atmosphere?

    "description": "The image is a pie chart illustrating the composition of the Earth's crust, oceans, and atmosphere by mass percentage for the five most abundant elements. The chart is divided into segments with corresponding labels and percentages:\n\n- **Oxygen** makes up the largest portion at **49.8%**.\n- **Silicon** follows with **26.3%**.\n- **Aluminum** accounts for **7.6%**.\n- **Iron** represents **4.8%**.\n- **Calcium** constitutes **3.4%**.\n- There is also a segment labeled \"Other elements,\" which collectively make up **7.9%**, but this category is not relevant to identifying the top five elements.\n\nThe five most abundant elements listed in the pie chart are Oxygen, Silicon, Aluminum, Iron, and Calcium. These elements are compared against the five elements that make up 98% of the mass of the human body: oxygen (61%), carbon (23%), hydrogen (10.0%), nitrogen (2.6%), and calcium (1.4%).\n\nBy comparing the two sets of elements, it is clear that **oxygen** and **calcium** are common to both lists. However, silicon, aluminum, and iron from the Earth's crust list do not appear in the human body list, while carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen from the human body list do not appear in the Earth's crust list. Therefore, the elements abundant in both the human body and Earth's crust, oceans, and atmosphere are **oxygen** and **calcium**. \n\nThus, none of the provided options (A, B, or C) correctly identify all the elements abundant in both contexts. The correct answer would be a combination of oxygen and calcium."
