    "options": "['segmentation', 'head-tail orientation', 'limb placement', 'type of symmetry', 'limb placement and segmentation', 'segmentation, type of symmetry and head-tail orientation', 'segmentation, head-tail orientation and limb placement', 'type of symmetry and head-tail orientation', 'segmentation and head-tail orientation']",

    "description": "The image shows a developing embryo with distinct features visible. The embryo appears elongated and has a clear anterior-posterior axis, indicating an established head-tail orientation. Along the length of the embryo, there are repeating patterns or bands of color, suggesting the presence of segmentation. These segments are arranged in a linear fashion from one end of the embryo to the other. The colors transition smoothly along the body, with no abrupt changes that would suggest limb placement. The overall shape and arrangement of the segments indicate bilateral symmetry, meaning the left and right sides of the embryo are mirror images of each other. There are no visible structures that resemble limbs or appendages at this stage. The image does not provide any information about the specific type of organism but focuses on the developmental features mentioned. \n\nBased on this description, the features already established at the stage shown in the image are segmentation, head-tail orientation, and type of symmetry. Therefore, the correct answer is F: segmentation, type of symmetry, and head-tail orientation."
