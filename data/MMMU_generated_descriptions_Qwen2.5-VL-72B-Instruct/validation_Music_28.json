    "description": "The image shows a musical notation with two notes on a treble clef staff. The first note is a flat (\u266d) symbol followed by a B note, which is located on the top line of the staff. The second note is an A note, which is located on the space below the top line of the staff. There is also a flat (\u266d) symbol before the A note. The notes are connected by a slur, indicating they should be played smoothly together. The interval between these two notes is a minor 7th."
