    "description": "The image depicts a large, spiraling tower with a conical shape, tapering towards the top. The structure appears to be made of stone or brick and has multiple levels, each slightly smaller than the one below it. At the very top, there is an open area with what looks like a small dome or cupola. The tower is situated on a flat, open ground, and there are several people visible near the base and along the spiral ramp that wraps around the exterior of the tower. The ramp seems wide enough for people to walk up and down. The architecture and design suggest that this is a historical building, likely of Islamic origin, given its style and the presence of the spiral ramp, which is characteristic of certain types of minarets. The overall appearance and context indicate that this structure is a minaret, typically associated with mosques, where the call to prayer is announced. \n\nBased on this description, the function of this structure was to D. Signal a time to pray, as in a minaret."
