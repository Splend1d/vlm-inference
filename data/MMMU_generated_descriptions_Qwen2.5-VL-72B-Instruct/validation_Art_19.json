    "description": "The image consists of three distinct photographs labeled as 1, 2, and 3.\n\n**Photo 1:** This photograph shows three individuals dressed in dark clothing walking on a light-colored, patterned surface. The individuals are positioned towards the left side of the frame, leaving a significant portion of the right side empty. The contrast between the dark figures and the light background creates a noticeable amount of negative space.\n\n**Photo 2:** This photograph displays a series of cylindrical objects with a grid-like pattern, emitting light from within. These objects are arranged in a row, filling most of the frame. There is minimal empty space around these objects, indicating a limited use of negative space.\n\n**Photo 3:** This photograph features two large, conical structures made of bricks or similar material. The structures are positioned close to each other, with a clear blue sky in the background. While there is some empty space around the structures, it is not as prominent as in Photo 1.\n\nBased on this description, the image that features a strong use of negative space is:\n\nA. Photo 1"
