    "options": "['Critical sociology', 'Feminist theory', 'Functionalist theory', 'Symbolic interactionism']",
    "id": "validation_Sociology_2",
    "description": "The image depicts a scene centered around education. In the foreground, there is a green book with the word \"EDUCATION\" written in bold, black letters on its cover. Resting atop this book is a small, detailed model of the Earth, showcasing various continents and oceans. Surrounding this central focus are stacks of books arranged on either side. The spines of these books display titles of different academic subjects, including \"MATHEMATICS,\" \"BIOLOGY,\" \"SOCIAL STUDIES,\" \"GEOGRAPHY,\" \"POLITICS,\" \"HISTORY,\" \"PHYSIOLOGY,\" \"COMPUTERS,\" \"ENGLISH,\" \"SPORTS,\" \"DESIGN,\" \"FINANCE,\" and \"RELIGION.\" These books represent a wide range of educational disciplines, emphasizing the comprehensive nature of learning. The overall setting suggests an environment dedicated to knowledge acquisition and intellectual growth. \n\nThe image highlights the importance of education and the diverse fields it encompasses but does not directly reference any sociological theories. However, the emphasis on labels such as subject titles could indirectly relate to how individuals acquire identities or roles within society through their educational experiences. This concept aligns closely with the principles of symbolic interactionism, which focuses on the meanings people derive from social interactions and the labels they adopt. Therefore, the theory most relevant to the labels acquired through the educational process depicted in the image is D. Symbolic interactionism."
