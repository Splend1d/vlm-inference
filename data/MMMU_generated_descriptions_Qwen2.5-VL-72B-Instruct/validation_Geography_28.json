    "question": "which type of  water in the <image 1> is located on the surfaces of individual soil particles. And this type of water is largely unavailable to plants because it is held firmly by molecular attractions so strong that they can not be broken by plants or through evaporation. ",
    "options": "['Gravitational water', 'Capillary water', 'Hygroscopic water']",

    "description": "The image illustrates three types of water present in soil: gravitational water, capillary water, and hygroscopic water. Each type is depicted with corresponding illustrations of soil moisture levels and plant conditions.\n\n1. **Gravitational Water**: This is shown as excess water that moves downward through the soil due to gravity after rainfall. The soil is saturated, and water droplets are seen dripping from the soil profile. Plants appear healthy, indicating sufficient water availability. The diagram shows a high level of soil moisture, with water filling most of the pore spaces between soil particles.\n\n2. **Capillary Water**: This occurs when the excess water has stopped flowing downward, and the soil reaches its field capacity. Water is held around soil grains by capillary tension, which makes it available to plants. The soil moisture level is lower than in gravitational water but still substantial. The plants remain healthy, suggesting that the water is accessible for their needs. The illustration shows water clinging to the surfaces of soil particles but not filling all the pore spaces.\n\n3. **Hygroscopic Water**: This is the water remaining in the soil after a period without rain, when there is no more available water, and the soil reaches its wilting point. Water is held by adhesion to the surfaces of individual soil particles and is not available to plants. The soil moisture level is very low, with only a thin film of water coating the soil particles. The plants appear wilted, indicating a lack of available water. The diagram emphasizes that this water is held so tightly by molecular attractions that it cannot be utilized by plants or lost through evaporation.\n\nBased on the descriptions provided, the type of water located on the surfaces of individual soil particles and largely unavailable to plants due to strong molecular attractions is **hygroscopic water**. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Hygroscopic water."
