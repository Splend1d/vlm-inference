If the live load is  represented by a uniformly distributed load of  0.8 kip/ft of variable length and a concentrated  load of 20 kips, determine the maximum force in  bar CM produced by the live load. Consider both  tension and compression. Joint E acts as a hinge.<image 1>",

    "description": "The image depicts a three-hinged trussed arch labeled as Figure P12.40. The structure consists of an upper chord with joints labeled B, C, D, E, F, G, H, and a lower chord with joints A and I. The arch has a total span of 144 feet, divided into six panels, each 24 feet wide. The height of the arch at its peak (joint E) is 36 feet, while the height at the supports (joints A and I) is 4 feet. The vertical distance between the upper and lower chords at the supports is 16 feet.\n\nThe truss includes diagonal members connecting the upper and lower chords, forming triangular sections for structural stability. Notably, joint E acts as a hinge, which is crucial for the analysis of the structure under load. The truss also features additional members such as M, L, K, J, which connect various joints within the structure.\n\nA uniformly distributed live load of 0.8 kip/ft and a concentrated load of 20 kips are applied to the upper chord panel points via a floor beam and stringer floor system. The problem requires determining the maximum force in bar CM due to these live loads, considering both tension and compression scenarios. The options provided for the solution are:\n\nA. Max.Compr.= 48.95 kips; Max.Tension = 13.1 kips  \nB. Max.Compr.= 43.95 kips; Max.Tension = 13.1 kips  \nC. Max.Compr.= 48.95 kips; Max.Tension = 33.1 kips  \n\nThe task involves analyzing the truss under different loading conditions to find the maximum forces in bar CM. The specific geometry, dimensions, and the presence of the hinge at joint E are essential for this analysis."
