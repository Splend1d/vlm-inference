    "description": "The image depicts a simple line graph with four points connected by straight lines. The first segment is a horizontal line followed by an upward-sloping diagonal line, indicating an increase. This upward trend continues until it reaches a peak at the third point. An orange arrow is placed above this upward-sloping section, pointing downward. After the peak, the final segment is a horizontal line again, showing no further change. The graph visually represents a sequence of events or actions with a clear rise leading up to a high point, which is then followed by a plateau. \n\nThis description should enable someone to understand the visual representation of a plot structure, specifically highlighting the part of the graph that shows an increase in tension or action leading up to a peak, which corresponds to the \"rising action\" in narrative terms."
