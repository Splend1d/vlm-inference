    "question": "<image 1> One of the questions in a study of marital satisfaction of dual-career couples was to rate the statement \"I'm pleased with the way we divide the responsibilities for childcare.\" The ratings went from one (strongly agree) to five (strongly disagree). Table 10.19 contains ten of the paired responses for husbands and wives. Conduct a hypothesis test to see if the mean difference in the husband's versus the wife's satisfaction level is negative (meaning that, within the partnership, the husband is happier than the wife).

    "description": "The image presents a table labeled \"Table 10.19,\" which contains paired responses from husbands and wives regarding their satisfaction with the division of childcare responsibilities. The ratings range from 1 (strongly agree) to 5 (strongly disagree).\n\nThe table has two rows:\n\n- **Wife's score:** This row lists the scores given by wives: 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 2, 1, 1, 2, 4.\n- **Husband's score:** This row lists the scores given by husbands: 2, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4.\n\nEach pair of numbers represents the responses from a couple, with the first number being the wife's score and the second number being the husband's score. There are ten pairs of responses in total. \n\nThe task involves conducting a hypothesis test to determine if the mean difference in satisfaction levels between husbands and wives is negative, indicating that husbands are generally more satisfied than wives. The goal is to calculate the t-value for this test."
