    "description": "The image shows a piecewise function \\( f(t) \\) plotted against time \\( t \\). The graph consists of three distinct segments:\n\n1. **Parabolic Segment (0 \u2264 t < 2):**\n   - The function starts at \\( f(0) = 0 \\).\n   - It follows a parabolic curve given by \\( f(t) = 5t^2 \\).\n   - At \\( t = 2 \\), the value of the function reaches \\( f(2) = 20 \\).\n\n2. **Constant Segment (2 \u2264 t < 5):**\n   - From \\( t = 2 \\) to \\( t = 5 \\), the function remains constant at \\( f(t) = 20 \\).\n\n3. **Linear Segment (5 \u2264 t \u2264 7):**\n   - At \\( t = 5 \\), the function drops instantly from 20 to 0.\n   - From \\( t = 5 \\) to \\( t = 7 \\), the function follows a linear path with a negative slope.\n   - At \\( t = 7 \\), the function reaches \\( f(7) = -30 \\).\n   - The equation for this segment is \\( f(t) = 15(t - 7) \\).\n\nThe function \\( f(t) \\) is zero for \\( t < 0 \\) and after \\( t > 7 \\).\n\nThe step functions \\( u(t) \\) represent the unit step function, which is 0 for \\( t < 0 \\) and 1 for \\( t \u2265 0 \\). The shifted step functions \\( u(t - a) \\) are 0 for \\( t < a \\) and 1 for \\( t \u2265 a \\)."
