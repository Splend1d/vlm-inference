    "description": "The image depicts an electrical circuit labeled \"Fig. 1.\" The circuit consists of the following components:\n\n1. A current source labeled \\( i(t) = \\cos\\left[\\frac{2}{3}t + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right] \\) amperes.\n2. Two resistors: one with a resistance of 2 ohms and another with a resistance of 1 ohm.\n3. A capacitor with a capacitance of \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) farad.\n4. A node labeled 'n' where the current source connects to the rest of the circuit.\n5. The capacitor is connected across the two resistors in parallel, and its voltage is denoted as \\( v_C(t) \\).\n\nThe circuit is arranged such that the current source feeds into the node 'n', which then splits between the two resistors and the capacitor. The voltage across the capacitor, \\( v_C(t) \\), is the quantity of interest for calculating the steady-state response. \n\nThe given options for the steady-state voltage \\( v_C(t) \\) are:\nA. \\( \\sqrt{2} \\cos\\left[\\frac{1}{3}t\\right] \\)\nB. \\( \\sqrt{3} \\cos\\left[\\frac{2}{3}t\\right] \\)\nC. \\( \\sqrt{2} \\cos\\left[\\frac{2}{3}t\\right] \\)\nD. \\( \\sqrt{3} \\cos\\left[\\frac{4}{3}t\\right] \\)\n\nTo solve for \\( v_C(t) \\), you would need to analyze the circuit using techniques like phasor analysis or Laplace transforms, considering the frequency content of the input current and the impedance of the circuit elements at that frequency."
