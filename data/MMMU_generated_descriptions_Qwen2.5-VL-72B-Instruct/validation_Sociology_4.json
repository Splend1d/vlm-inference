Each circle contains a simple stick figure with a unique symbol or object, representing different roles or professions. \n\n- The top row includes figures holding a wand with a star, a dollar sign, and a rifle.\n- The middle row shows figures with a crescent moon and star, a question mark, and a cross.\n- The bottom row depicts figures with a wrench, scissors, and a hammer and sickle.\n\nAt the bottom of the image, the text reads \"solidarity from inter-dependence.\" This suggests that the figures represent various specialized roles within a society, each contributing to a collective whole through their specific functions.
