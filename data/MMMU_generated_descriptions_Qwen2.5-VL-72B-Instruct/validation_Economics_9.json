    "description": "The image is a graph with two axes: the horizontal axis represents the Unemployment Rate (%) ranging from 0% to 10%, and the vertical axis represents the Inflation Rate (%) also ranging from 0% to 10%. There are two curves depicted on the graph:\n\n- **Curve 1** is a vertical line located at an unemployment rate of approximately 6%. This line intersects the inflation rate axis at various points but does not change its position horizontally.\n  \n- **Curve 2** is a downward-sloping line that starts at the top left corner of the graph (around 9% inflation and 0% unemployment) and extends to the bottom right corner (around 0% inflation and 9% unemployment). Points A, B, C, D, and E lie along this curve:\n    - Point A is at about 4% unemployment and 5% inflation.\n    - Point B is at about 6% unemployment and 3% inflation.\n    - Point C is at about 8% unemployment and 1% inflation.\n    - Point D is at about 6% unemployment and 6% inflation.\n    - Point E is at about 6% unemployment and 2% inflation.\n\nThe vertical Curve 1 intersects the downward-sloping Curve 2 at three points: B, D, and E. Point B is where the economy is initially located according to the question. \n\nIf the money supply growth rate increases, it leads to higher inflation while keeping the unemployment rate constant in the short term. Therefore, the economy would move vertically upward along the vertical Curve 1. Since the initial point is B, the new point after the increase in the money supply growth rate would be D, which has the same unemployment rate as B but a higher inflation rate. Thus, the correct answer is B. moves to D."
