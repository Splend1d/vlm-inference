    "description": "The image shows a close-up view of the human tongue divided into four quadrants by two intersecting lines: one horizontal and one vertical. The tongue appears to have a pinkish color with small bumps or papillae scattered across its surface. \n\n- **Quadrant 1 (top left)**: This section is located towards the back and left side of the tongue.\n- **Quadrant 2 (bottom left)**: This section is located towards the front and left side of the tongue.\n- **Quadrant 3 (bottom right)**: This section is located towards the front and right side of the tongue.\n- **Quadrant 4 (top right)**: This section is located towards the back and right side of the tongue.\n\nThe quadrants are labeled with numbers: 1 in the bottom left, 2 in the bottom right, 3 in the middle right, and 4 in the top right. The taste buds responsible for detecting different tastes are primarily located on the front two-thirds of the tongue, which corresponds to Quadrants 2, 3, and 4. Therefore, a loss of taste would be expected in these areas."
