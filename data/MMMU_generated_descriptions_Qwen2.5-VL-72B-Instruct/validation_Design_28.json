    "description": "The image depicts a kitchen floor plan with a clear layout of various elements. The kitchen features a work triangle formed by connecting three key areas: a stove (with an oven below it), a sink, and a refrigerator. These points are connected by dashed blue lines to illustrate the work triangle. \n\nAdditionally, there is a traffic pattern indicated by another dashed blue line that loops around the kitchen space. This traffic pattern starts from the bottom left corner of the image, curves around the right side of the kitchen, and then exits at the top right corner. The traffic pattern does not intersect or pass through the work triangle area; instead, it flows around it.\n\nThe kitchen also includes cabinets and countertops along the walls, but these do not interfere with the work triangle. There is a central island in the middle of the kitchen, which is separate from the work triangle and traffic pattern.\n\nBased on this description, the question \"No major _____ should cross through the basic work triangle\" can be answered. The correct option is:\n\nB. Traffic\n\nThis is because the traffic pattern, as shown in the image, avoids crossing through the work triangle."
