    "question": "A collimated beam containing two different frequencies of light travels through vacuum and is incident on a piece of glass. Which of the schematics below depicts the phenomenon of dispersion within the glass in a qualitative correct manner? Select (e) if none of the options are qualitatively correct.",

    "description": "The provided images depict the behavior of light beams with different colors (representing different frequencies) as they pass from a vacuum into borosilicate glass. Here's a detailed description of each image:\n\n**Image A:**\n- The diagram shows a vacuum on the left side and borosilicate glass on the right.\n- Two light beams, one green and one red, are incident at an angle \\( \\alpha \\) from the vacuum into the glass.\n- Both beams bend upon entering the glass, but the green beam bends more sharply than the red beam.\n- This indicates that the green light has a higher refractive index in the glass compared to the red light.\n\n**Image B:**\n- Similar setup with vacuum on the left and borosilicate glass on the right.\n- Three light beams are present: blue, red, and green.\n- Upon entering the glass, the blue beam bends the most, followed by the green beam, and then the red beam.\n- This suggests that the refractive index increases with decreasing wavelength (blue > green > red).\n\n**Image C:**\n- Same vacuum-glass interface as before.\n- Two light beams, green and red, are shown.\n- Both beams bend upon entering the glass, but the red beam bends more sharply than the green beam.\n- This is contrary to the expected behavior since it implies a lower refractive index for shorter wavelengths.\n\n**Image D:**\n- Vacuum on the left and borosilicate glass on the right.\n- Two light beams, green and blue, are depicted.\n- Both beams bend upon entering the glass, but the blue beam bends less than the green beam.\n- This also contradicts the expected behavior where shorter wavelengths should have a higher refractive index.\n\n### Summary:\n- **Image A** correctly shows that green light (shorter wavelength) bends more than red light (longer wavelength).\n- **Image B** correctly shows that blue light (shortest wavelength) bends the most, followed by green and then red.\n- **Images C and D** incorrectly show longer wavelengths bending more than shorter wavelengths.\n\nBased on this description, the correct answer is either **A** or **B**, depending on whether the question specifies two or three frequencies. If only two frequencies are considered, **A** is correct. If three frequencies are considered, **B** is correct."
