    "description": "The image depicts a dramatic scene with a group of figures gathered around a central figure who appears to be lifeless or in a state of extreme distress. The composition is highly dynamic, with the figures arranged in a complex, intertwined manner. The central figure is being supported by others, and there is a sense of movement and tension throughout the scene. \n\nThe figures are dressed in flowing robes with rich colors and intricate folds, suggesting a high level of attention to detail in the drapery. The expressions on the faces of the figures convey intense emotion, ranging from sorrow to concern. The background includes a cloudy sky, adding to the overall dramatic effect.\n\nThe painting features elongated figures and exaggerated poses, which are characteristic of a specific artistic style. The use of color is vibrant but somewhat artificial, and the perspective is manipulated for dramatic effect rather than realism. The overall composition is unbalanced, with a sense of instability and tension.\n\nGiven these characteristics, the painting is most likely characterized by the **Mannerist** style."
