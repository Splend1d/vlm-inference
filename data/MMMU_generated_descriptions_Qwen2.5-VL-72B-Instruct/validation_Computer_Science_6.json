    "description": "The image is a graph depicting two curves labeled \\( J_{\\text{train}}(\\theta) \\) and \\( J_{\\text{test}}(\\theta) \\), representing the training error and test error, respectively, as functions of the training set size \\( m \\). The x-axis represents the training set size \\( m \\), while the y-axis represents the error.\n\n- The \\( J_{\\text{train}}(\\theta) \\) curve starts at a low value when the training set size is small and increases gradually as the training set size grows. This indicates that the training error initially decreases but then plateaus or slightly increases as more data is added.\n  \n- The \\( J_{\\text{test}}(\\theta) \\) curve starts at a higher value compared to \\( J_{\\text{train}}(\\theta) \\) when the training set size is small and decreases as the training set size increases. However, it does not converge closely to the \\( J_{\\text{train}}(\\theta) \\) curve even when the training set size becomes large. There remains a noticeable gap between the two curves.\n\nThe gap between the \\( J_{\\text{train}}(\\theta) \\) and \\( J_{\\text{test}}(\\theta) \\) curves suggests that the model performs well on the training data but poorly on the test data, indicating overfitting. This is characteristic of high variance, where the model captures noise in the training data and fails to generalize well to unseen data. Therefore, the algorithm is suffering from **high variance**."
