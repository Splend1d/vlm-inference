    "question": "A, B and C are three visible stations in a hydrographic survey. The computed sides of the triangle ABC are AB = 1200 m, BC = 1442 m and CA = 1960 m. A station O is established outside the triangle and its position is to be determined by resection on A, B and C, the angle AOB and BOC being respectively 45\u00b030' and 52\u00b015'. Determine distances of OA and OC, if O and Bare on the opposite sides of line AC.<image 1>",

    "description": "The image depicts a geometric diagram involving four points: A, B, C, and O. These points form a quadrilateral with additional internal angles and distances labeled. Here's a detailed breakdown:\n\n- **Triangle ABC**: This triangle has vertices at points A, B, and C.\n    - Side AB measures 1200 meters.\n    - Side BC measures 1442 meters.\n    - Side CA measures 1960 meters.\n  \n- **Point O**: This point lies outside the triangle ABC and forms additional angles and segments with points A, B, and C.\n    - Angle AOB (denoted as \u03b1) is given as 45\u00b030'.\n    - Angle BOC (denoted as \u03b2) is given as 52\u00b015'.\n\n- **Internal Angles at Triangle Vertices**:\n    - At vertex A, there is an angle x between lines OA and AB.\n    - At vertex B, there is an angle z between lines OB and BC.\n    - At vertex C, there is an angle y between lines OC and CA.\n\n- **Distances from Point O**:\n    - The distance OA is unknown and needs to be determined.\n    - The distance OC is also unknown and needs to be determined.\n\n- **Relative Positioning**:\n    - Points O and B are on opposite sides of the line segment AC.\n\nThe problem requires determining the distances OA and OC using the given side lengths of triangle ABC and the specified angles at point O. The options provided for the distances are:\n- A. AO = 884.49 m, CO = 1644 m\n- B. AO = 884.49 m, CO = 1624 m\n- C. AO = 885.49 m, CO = 1634 m\n- D. AO = 884.49 m, CO = 1634 m\n\nThis information should be sufficient to solve the problem without needing the visual representation."
