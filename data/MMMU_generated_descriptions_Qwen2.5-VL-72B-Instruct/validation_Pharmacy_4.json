    "question": "The mass of the elements iron and oxygen in four samples of a rustcolored substance was measured in grams (g). The amount of iron and oxygen in each sample is shown on the graph. <image 1>, Determine if the following content is correct based on the image and text:All four samples are the same compound.",

    "description": "The image consists of two parts:\n\n**Part 1:** A scatter plot titled \"Mass of Elements in Samples.\"  \n- The x-axis represents the \"Mass of oxygen (g)\" ranging from 0 to 8 grams.\n- The y-axis represents the \"Mass of iron (g)\" ranging from 0 to 20 grams.\n- Four data points are plotted on the graph:\n  - Point 1: Approximately at (2 g oxygen, 5 g iron).\n  - Point 2: Approximately at (4 g oxygen, 10 g iron).\n  - Point 3: Approximately at (6 g oxygen, 15 g iron).\n  - Point 4: Approximately at (8 g oxygen, 20 g iron).\n- These points lie approximately along a straight line passing through the origin (0,0), indicating a linear relationship between the mass of iron and the mass of oxygen.\n\n**Part 2:** A mathematical proportion statement:\n- It states: \\( \\frac{\\text{g iron}}{\\text{g oxygen}} = \\frac{5 \\text{ g iron}}{2.25 \\text{ g oxygen}} \\approx \\frac{2.3 \\text{ g iron}}{\\text{g oxygen}} \\).\n\nThis suggests that the ratio of iron to oxygen is consistent across different masses, supporting the idea that the samples have a fixed composition. \n\nBased on these descriptions, all four samples appear to maintain a constant ratio of iron to oxygen, suggesting they are likely the same compound. Therefore, the statement \"All four samples are the same compound\" is supported by the provided information."
