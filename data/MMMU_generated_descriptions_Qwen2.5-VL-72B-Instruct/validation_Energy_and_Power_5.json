    "description": "The image depicts a cross-sectional view of a hollow steel sphere partially submerged in water. The sphere's outer radius \\( R \\) is given as 7 inches. The wall thickness of the sphere is specified as 0.16 inches. The material of the sphere is steel with a specific gravity (SG) of 7.85. The sphere is shown floating in water, with a portion of its volume submerged, indicated by the height \\( h \\). The term \"steel\" is written at the top of the sphere, and \"Sphere\" is labeled near the center. The word \"Water\" is written below the sphere, indicating the surrounding medium. The diagram also includes arrows pointing inward toward the sphere, possibly representing forces or pressures acting on it. The question asks for the amount of weight that needs to be added inside the sphere to make it neutrally buoyant, providing three options: A. 15 lbf, B. 50 lbf, and C. 25 lbf."
