The dotted line connects the points for 2003 and 2011; it represents the average rate of change in reported injuries and illness over the eight-year period. <image 1> The least-squares regression line is least successful at predicting the number of injury and illness reports in ____________.",

    "description": "The image is a scatter plot titled \"Injuries and Illness Reported per Year.\" The x-axis represents the years from 2003 to 2011, while the y-axis represents the number of cases per 100 full-time workers, ranging from 3.0 to 5.5. Each year has a corresponding data point plotted on the graph, indicating the number of reported injuries and illnesses.\n\nThere are two lines on the graph:\n1. A solid line, which is the least-squares regression line, fitting through the data points.\n2. A dashed line connecting the data points for 2003 and 2011, representing the average rate of change over the eight-year period.\n\nThe data points and their approximate positions relative to the lines are as follows:\n\n- **2003:** The data point is near the top left corner, with a value slightly below 5.0 cases per 100 workers. Both lines start close to this point.\n- **2004:** The data point is slightly lower than the 2003 point but still relatively high.\n- **2005:** The data point continues to decrease and is positioned closer to the solid regression line.\n- **2006:** The data point further decreases and remains close to the solid regression line.\n- **2007:** The data point is slightly below the solid regression line, showing a small deviation.\n- **2008:** The data point is noticeably below the solid regression line, showing a larger deviation compared to other years.\n- **2009:** The data point is close to the solid regression line again.\n- **2010:** The data point is very close to the solid regression line.\n- **2011:** The data point is near the bottom right corner, with a value slightly above 3.0 cases per 100 workers. Both lines end close to this point.\n\nThe solid regression line generally fits the trend of decreasing cases over time, but there are deviations where the data points do not align perfectly with the line. The largest deviation occurs in 2008, where the data point is significantly below the solid regression line. Therefore, the least-squares regression line is least successful at predicting the number of injury and illness reports in 2008. However, since 2008 is not an option in the question, the next largest deviation appears to be in 2007."
