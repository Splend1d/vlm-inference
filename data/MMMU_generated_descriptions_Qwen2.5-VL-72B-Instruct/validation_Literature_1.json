    "question": "Refer to the figure <image 1>, which term describes a character who is in direct juxtaposition to another character and serves to highlight the characteristics of the other individual?",
    "options": "['Protagonist', 'Round character', 'Character foil', 'Shape']",
    "id": "validation_Literature_1",
    "description": "The image shows three children sitting side by side on a beige couch. Each child is holding up a drawing in front of their face. The drawings appear to be self-portraits or characters drawn by the children themselves. \n\n- The child on the left is wearing a light blue top and purple pants with a pattern. They hold up a red drawing featuring a simple, smiling face with a crown-like shape on top.\n- The middle child wears a green dress with a layered skirt. Their yellow drawing depicts a smiling face with curly hair and a bow on top.\n- The child on the right is dressed in a yellow top and green shorts. They display a green drawing showing a smiling face with straight hair and a headband.\n\nEach child's drawing contrasts with their clothing color and style, creating a visual juxtaposition between the child and the drawing they are holding. The drawings serve to highlight the individuality and creativity of each child. \n\nIn this context, the term \"character foil\" refers to a character who contrasts with another character to emphasize certain traits. However, since the image focuses on the children and their drawings rather than contrasting characters within a narrative, the concept of a \"character foil\" does not directly apply here."
