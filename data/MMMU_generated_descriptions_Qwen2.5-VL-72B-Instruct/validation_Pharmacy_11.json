    "description": "The image displays three labeled waveforms, each representing an electromagnetic wave: (A), (B), and (C). \n\n- Waveform (A) shows a series of smooth, rounded peaks and troughs with significant vertical distance between the highest point (peak) and the lowest point (trough). This indicates a large amplitude.\n  \n- Waveform (B) also consists of peaks and troughs but with less vertical distance between them compared to waveform (A). The amplitude here is smaller than in waveform (A).\n  \n- Waveform (C) features the smallest vertical distance between its peaks and troughs among the three. The amplitude is visibly the smallest when compared to waveforms (A) and (B).\n\nEach waveform is labeled clearly as (A), (B), or (C) for identification. The term \"Waves\" is written at the top of the image."
