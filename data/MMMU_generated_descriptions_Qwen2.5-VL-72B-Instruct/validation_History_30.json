    "question": "<image 1> The map above was constructed by drawing a thin line for each voyage recorded in British trade ship logs between 1750 and 1800. As a result, the darker shaded areas record the most heavily traveled routes. Which of the following conclusions could be drawn from the evidence provided by this map?",
    "options": "['British ships did not sail along the west coast of Africa during this period.', 'British ships did not sail the Atlantic Ocean during this period.', 'British ships did not sail the Pacific Ocean during this period.', 'British ships did not sail in the Indian Ocean during this period.']",

    "description": "The image is a grayscale world map titled \"BRITISH TRADE ROUTES AS SHOWN BY SHIP LOGS 1750-1800.\" The map highlights various maritime routes using thin lines, with denser clusters of lines indicating more frequently traveled paths. \n\nKey observations include:\n\n1. **Atlantic Ocean**: There is a dense concentration of lines across the Atlantic Ocean, connecting Europe to North America and parts of South America. This suggests heavy traffic in this region.\n2. **West Coast of Africa**: Lines are visible along the west coast of Africa, indicating that British ships did sail along this route.\n3. **Indian Ocean**: There are numerous lines traversing the Indian Ocean, connecting Europe to India, Southeast Asia, and parts of East Africa.\n4. **Pacific Ocean**: There are no visible lines crossing the Pacific Ocean, suggesting that British ships did not sail through this area during the specified time period.\n5. **Other Areas**: The map also shows some activity around the Mediterranean Sea and parts of the Arctic regions near Greenland and Iceland.\n\nThe map credits its data source as CLIWOC (www.cassiodorus.com/cliwoc) and mentions that it was created by spatialanalysis.co.uk. A compass rose is present in the upper right corner, aiding in orientation.\n\nBased on the description, the conclusion that can be drawn is:\nC. British ships did not sail the Pacific Ocean during this period."
