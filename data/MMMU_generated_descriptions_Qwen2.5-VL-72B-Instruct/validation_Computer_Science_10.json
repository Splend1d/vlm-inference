    "description": "The image displays an adjacency matrix for a weighted undirected graph with six vertices (labeled from 1 to 6). The matrix is symmetric about the diagonal, indicating the undirected nature of the graph. Each entry in the matrix represents the weight of the edge connecting two vertices. An \"\u221e\" symbol indicates no direct edge between the corresponding vertices. Here's the detailed matrix:\n\n```\n   | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  | 6  |\n---|----|----|----|----|----|----|\n1  | \u221e  | 3  | 1  | 15 | 1  | 9  |\n2  | 3  | \u221e  | 3  | 13 | \u221e  | 8  |\n3  | 1  | 3  | \u221e  | 1  | 1  | 2  |\n4  | 15 | 13 | 1  | \u221e  | 18 | \u221e  |\n5  | 1  | \u221e  | 1  | 18 | \u221e  | 2  |\n6  | 9  | 8  | 2  | \u221e  | 2  | \u221e  |\n```\n\nTo find the total weight of the minimum spanning tree, one would use an algorithm like Kruskal's or Prim's. However, by analyzing the matrix, we can identify the edges with the smallest weights and ensure they form a connected graph without cycles. The smallest weights are:\n\n- Edge (1, 3) with weight 1\n- Edge (3, 4) with weight 1\n- Edge (3, 5) with weight 1\n- Edge (5, 6) with weight 2\n- Edge (2, 3) with weight 3\n\nAdding these weights: 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 8.\n\nThus, the total weight of the minimum spanning tree is 8."
