    "description": "The image depicts a structural engineering problem involving a beam with specific dimensions, loads, and boundary conditions. Here's a detailed description:\n\n- **Beam Configuration**: The beam is a horizontal member extending from point A to point B and then continuing diagonally downward to a spring support.\n  \n- **Horizontal Segment (AB)**:\n  - Length: 8 feet.\n  - Point A is fixed (indicated by a vertical line and a horizontal line forming an \"L\" shape).\n  - At point B, there is a concentrated load of 30 kips acting vertically downward.\n\n- **Diagonal Segment**:\n  - Extends from point B to the spring support.\n  - Length: 12 feet horizontally from B to the spring.\n  - The diagonal segment forms a right triangle with the horizontal and vertical legs being 12 feet and 9 feet respectively, making the total length of the diagonal segment approximately 15 feet (using Pythagoras theorem).\n\n- **Spring Support**:\n  - Located at the end of the diagonal segment.\n  - Spring constant \\( k \\) is given as 5 kips per inch.\n\n- **Material Properties**:\n  - Young's modulus \\( E \\) is provided as 3000 kips per square inch.\n  - Moment of inertia \\( I \\) is specified as 0.5 times the gross moment of inertia \\( I_G \\).\n\n- **Question Requirements**:\n  - Compute the initial deflection at the midspan of the beam using a finite summation method.\n  - Use 3-foot segments for the calculation.\n  - The midspan refers to the midpoint of the horizontal segment AB, which is 4 feet from point A.\n\nThis description provides all necessary details about the geometry, loading, material properties, and requirements for solving the problem."
