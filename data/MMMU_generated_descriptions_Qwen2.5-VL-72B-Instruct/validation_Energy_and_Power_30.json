    "question": "In contrast to the liquid rocket in Fig. P3.34, the solid-propellant rocket in Fig. P3.35 is self-contained and has no entrance ducts. Using a control-volume analysis for the conditions shown in Fig. P3.35, compute the rate of mass loss of the propellant, assuming that the exit gas has a molecular weight of 28. <image 1>",

    "description": "The image depicts a schematic diagram of a solid-propellant rocket engine, labeled as \"Fig. P3.35.\" The diagram illustrates the flow of propellant through the combustion chamber and out through the nozzle's exit section. Key details provided in the figure include:\n\n- **Propellant**: The propellant is shown entering the combustion chamber where it undergoes combustion.\n- **Combustion Chamber Conditions**: The combustion chamber operates at a temperature of 1500 K and a pressure of 950 kPa.\n- **Exit Section Details**:\n    - Diameter (\\(D_e\\)): 18 cm (0.18 m).\n    - Pressure (\\(P_e\\)): 90 kPa.\n    - Velocity (\\(V_e\\)): 1150 m/s.\n    - Temperature (\\(T_e\\)): 750 K.\n- **Molecular Weight of Exit Gas**: The molecular weight of the gas exiting the nozzle is specified as 28 g/mol.\n\nThe question asks for the rate of mass loss of the propellant using a control-volume analysis, given these conditions. The options provided for the answer are:\nA. -10.0 kg/s  \nB. -11.8 kg/s  \nC. -12.4 kg/s  \n\nTo solve this problem, one would use the provided exit conditions along with the ideal gas law and continuity equation to determine the mass flow rate. The negative sign indicates mass leaving the system."
