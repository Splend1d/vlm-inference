    "question": "<image 1> In Ayrshire cattle, the mahogany/red locus is an autosomal gene. In both sexes, mahogany homozygotes are mahogany colored, and red homozygotes are red. However, the mahogany/red heterozygote is mahogany if male and red if female. Here is a pedigree for an Ayrshire family that is of great interest to Farmer MacDonald. (In the pedigree, open circles and squares indicate the mahogany phenotype; filled indicate red.) Although Elmer has long ago become a huge pile of Big Macs, Farmer MacDonald has frozen a good supply of Elmer's semen and has used it to artificially inseminate Elmira. What is the probability that Elmira will produce a mahogany female calf?",

    "description": "The image is a pedigree chart representing the inheritance pattern of the mahogany/red locus in an Ayrshire cattle family. The symbols used in the pedigree are as follows:\n\n- Open circles represent females with the mahogany phenotype.\n- Open squares represent males with the mahogany phenotype.\n- Filled circles represent females with the red phenotype.\n- Filled squares represent males with the red phenotype.\n\nThe individuals in the pedigree are labeled as follows:\n\n- Elsie: An open circle, indicating a female with the mahogany phenotype.\n- Elmer: An open square, indicating a male with the mahogany phenotype.\n- Elinor: A filled circle, indicating a female with the red phenotype.\n- Earnest: A filled square, indicating a male with the red phenotype.\n- Elmira: A filled circle, indicating a female with the red phenotype.\n\nThe connections between the individuals show their parentage:\n- Elsie and Elmer are parents to Elinor and Earnest.\n- Elmer is also the father of Elmira, whose mother is not shown in the pedigree but must have the red phenotype since Elmira is red.\n\nBased on the given information about the mahogany/red locus:\n- Mahogany homozygotes (MM) are mahogany in both sexes.\n- Red homozygotes (mm) are red in both sexes.\n- Heterozygotes (Mm) are mahogany if male and red if female.\n\nFrom the pedigree:\n- Elsie (mahogany female) must be either MM or Mm.\n- Elmer (mahogany male) must be MM because he passed on the mahogany trait to his offspring.\n- Elinor (red female) must be mm.\n- Earnest (red male) must be mm.\n- Elmira (red female) must be Mm since she has a mahogany father (Elmer, MM).\n\nGiven this information, we need to determine the probability that Elmira (Mm) will produce a mahogany female calf when mated with Elmer (MM). The possible genotypes of the offspring from this mating are MM and Mm. Since all female calves with the Mm genotype will be red, the only way to get a mahogany female calf is if the genotype is MM. The probability of getting an MM female calf is 1/2 (for the MM genotype) times 1/2 (for being female), which equals 1/4.\n\nTherefore, the probability that Elmira will produce a mahogany female calf is 1/4."
