    "question": "In order to study the relationship between drinking alcohol and hypertension, a case-control study was conducted in 1992 by the Epidemiology Department of Shandong Medical University on the basis of community-based population screening, in which 154 new cases of hypertension were randomly selected as a case group and 583 normal people as a control group. The past alcohol consumption of the study subjects was investigated, along with variables such as age, sex, and body mass index (BMI>24 as overweight). Considering that body mass index may be a potential confounder when analysing the relationship between drinking alcohol and hypertension, it needs to be analysed and judged. The following table presents unstratified information on the relationship between the drinking alcohol and hypertensive disorders. <image 1> The cOR between the drinking alcohol and hypertensive is",

    "description": "The image is a table summarizing data from a case-control study investigating the relationship between drinking alcohol and hypertension. The table is divided into three main columns: \"Drinking alcohol,\" \"Cases(%),\" and \"Control(%)\", with an additional column for \"Total.\" The rows categorize participants based on their alcohol consumption status (\"Yes\" or \"No\").\n\n- **Drinking alcohol: Yes**\n    - Cases (%): 73 (47.4%)\n    - Control (%): 202 (34.6%)\n    - Total: 275\n\n- **Drinking alcohol: No**\n    - Cases (%): 81 (52.6%)\n    - Control (%): 381 (65.4%)\n    - Total: 462\n\n- **Overall Totals**:\n    - Cases: 154\n    - Controls: 583\n    - Grand Total: 737\n\nThis table provides the necessary counts to calculate the crude odds ratio (cOR) for the association between drinking alcohol and hypertension. The cOR can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{cOR} = \\frac{(a \\times d)}{(b \\times c)} \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( a \\) = Number of cases who drink alcohol (73)\n- \\( b \\) = Number of controls who drink alcohol (202)\n- \\( c \\) = Number of cases who do not drink alcohol (81)\n- \\( d \\) = Number of controls who do not drink alcohol (381)\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{cOR} = \\frac{(73 \\times 381)}{(202 \\times 81)} \\approx 1.70 \\]\n\nThus, the crude odds ratio (cOR) between drinking alcohol and hypertension is approximately 1.70."
