    "question": "Which of the following regions is the main part of the neuron that contains neurotransmitter receptors (i.e. recieves incoming messages)? <image 1>",
    "options": "['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F']",
    "id": "validation_Psychology_7",
    "description": "The image depicts a diagram of a typical neuron with various parts labeled from A to F. \n\n- **A** represents the dendrites, which are branch-like structures extending from the cell body. They appear as numerous small branches spreading outwards.\n- **B** indicates the cell body or soma, which is the central part of the neuron containing the nucleus. It is depicted as a rounded structure with a darker spot representing the nucleus.\n- **C** shows the axon, a long, cable-like projection extending from the cell body. It appears as a single, elongated structure branching off from the cell body.\n- **D** labels the myelin sheath, which is shown as a series of segmented, light blue coverings along the length of the axon. These segments are separated by small gaps.\n- **E** marks the nodes of Ranvier, which are the small gaps between the segments of the myelin sheath along the axon.\n- **F** represents the axon terminals or synaptic terminals, which are the branched ends of the axon. They appear as smaller branches at the end of the axon.\n\nNeurotransmitter receptors, which receive incoming messages, are primarily located on the dendrites and the cell body. Therefore, based on the description, the correct answer would be either **A** (dendrites) or **B** (cell body). Since dendrites are specifically designed for receiving signals, **A** is the most accurate choice."
