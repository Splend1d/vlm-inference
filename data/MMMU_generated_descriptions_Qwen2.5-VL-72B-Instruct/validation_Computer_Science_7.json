    "question": "A hash table of length 10 uses open addressing with hash function h(k)=k mod 10, and linear probing. After inserting 6 values into an empty hash table, the table is as shown below. Which one of the following choices gives a possible order in which the key values could have been inserted in the table?<image 1>",
    "options": "['46, 42, 34, 52, 23, 33', '34, 42, 23, 52, 33, 46', '46, 34, 42, 23, 52, 33', '42, 46, 33, 23, 34, 52']",

    "description": "The image shows a hash table of length 10, where each cell corresponds to an index from 0 to 9. The table is populated with the following values:\n\n- Index 0: Empty (no value)\n- Index 1: Empty (no value)\n- Index 2: Contains the value 42\n- Index 3: Contains the value 23\n- Index 4: Contains the value 34\n- Index 5: Contains the value 52\n- Index 6: Contains the value 46\n- Index 7: Contains the value 33\n- Index 8: Empty (no value)\n- Index 9: Empty (no value)\n\nThe table uses open addressing with a hash function \\( h(k) = k \\mod 10 \\), and linear probing for collision resolution. This means that when a collision occurs, the next available slot is used sequentially until an empty slot is found. \n\nThe task is to determine the possible order in which the six values (42, 23, 34, 52, 46, 33) were inserted into the table. The correct sequence should result in the final state of the table as described above."
