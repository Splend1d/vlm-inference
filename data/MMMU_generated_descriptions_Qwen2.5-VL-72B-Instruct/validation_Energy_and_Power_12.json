    "question": "A 40-ft^3 adiabatic container is initially evacuated. The supply line contains air that is maintained at 150 psia and 90\u00b0F. The valve is opened until the pressure in the container is the same as the pressure in the supply line. Determine the work potential of the air in this container when it is filled.

    "description": "The image depicts a simple schematic of a system involving a vessel, a valve, and a supply line. Here's a detailed description:\n\n- **Vessel**: A cylindrical container labeled \"Vessel\" is shown. This represents an adiabatic container with a volume of 40 ft\u00b3. Initially, this vessel is evacuated, meaning it contains no air or any substance inside.\n  \n- **Valve**: Below the vessel, there is a valve depicted as a circular component attached to a pipe. The valve controls the flow between the vessel and the supply line. In the context of the problem, this valve is opened to allow air from the supply line to enter the vessel.\n  \n- **Supply Line**: A horizontal pipe labeled \"Supply line\" is connected to the valve. This supply line contains air at a specified pressure and temperature. The air in the supply line is maintained at a pressure of 150 psia (pounds per square inch absolute) and a temperature of 90\u00b0F (degrees Fahrenheit).\n\nThe scenario described involves filling the evacuated vessel with air from the supply line by opening the valve until the pressure inside the vessel equals the pressure in the supply line (150 psia). The task is to determine the work potential of the air in the container once it is filled, given an ambient temperature \\( T_0 \\) of 80\u00b0F.\n\nTo solve for the work potential, one would typically use thermodynamic principles, considering the adiabatic nature of the vessel and the properties of the air (such as specific heat ratios and gas constants), but these calculations are beyond the scope of the image description. The provided options for the work potential are:\n- A. W = 817 Btu\n- B. W = 917 Btu\n- C. W = 1017 Btu\n\nThis description should enable someone to understand the system setup and the conditions necessary to solve the thermodynamic problem presented in the question."
