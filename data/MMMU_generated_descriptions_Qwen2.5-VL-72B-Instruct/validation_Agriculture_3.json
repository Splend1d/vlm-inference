    "description": "The image shows a close-up view of a plant with broad green leaves. The leaves have a noticeable yellowish-green discoloration, which appears to be spreading across their surfaces. This discoloration is not uniform but rather patchy, with some areas more affected than others. The affected areas have a slightly fuzzy or powdery texture, giving them a somewhat velvety appearance. The plant also has purple flowers in the background, but they are not the focus of the image. The overall condition of the leaves suggests a fungal infection, characterized by the powdery appearance and the specific pattern of discoloration."
