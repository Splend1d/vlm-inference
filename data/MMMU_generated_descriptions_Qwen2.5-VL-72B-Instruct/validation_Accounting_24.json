    "description": "The image provides data for two stocks, Stock A and Stock B, related to their performance in an index model regression analysis. Here is the detailed breakdown:\n\n### Stock A:\n- **Index Model Regression Estimate:** \\( 1\\% + 1.2(r_M - r_f) \\)\n    - This indicates that the expected excess return of Stock A is 1% plus 1.2 times the market excess return.\n- **R-square:** 0.576\n    - This measures the proportion of the variance in Stock A's excess returns explained by the market excess returns.\n- **Residual Standard Deviation (\\( \\sigma(e) \\)):** 10.3%\n    - This represents the standard deviation of the residuals from the regression, indicating the unexplained variability in Stock A's returns.\n- **Standard Deviation of Excess Returns:** 21.6%\n    - This is the total volatility of Stock A's excess returns.\n\n### Stock B:\n- **Index Model Regression Estimate:** \\( 2\\% + 0.8(r_M - r_f) \\)\n    - This indicates that the expected excess return of Stock B is 2% plus 0.8 times the market excess return.\n- **R-square:** 0.436\n    - This measures the proportion of the variance in Stock B's excess returns explained by the market excess returns.\n- **Residual Standard Deviation (\\( \\sigma(e) \\)):** 19.1%\n    - This represents the standard deviation of the residuals from the regression, indicating the unexplained variability in Stock B's returns.\n- **Standard Deviation of Excess Returns:** 24.9%\n    - This is the total volatility of Stock B's excess returns.\n\n### Additional Information:\n- **Risk-Free Rate (\\( r_f \\)):** 6%\n- **Market Average Return (\\( r_M \\)):** 14%\n\nThis data is necessary to calculate the Information Ratio for both stocks using the provided formula and values."
