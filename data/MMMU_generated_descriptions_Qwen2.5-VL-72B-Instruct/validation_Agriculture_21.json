    "description": "The image shows a collection of broad bean pods arranged on a perforated metal surface. The pods vary in appearance and condition:\n\n- **Color and Texture**: Most of the pods have a greenish hue, but many also display dark spots, blemishes, and discoloration. Some areas appear to be blackened or browned.\n  \n- **Shape and Structure**: The pods are elongated with a curved shape typical of broad beans. However, several pods show signs of distortion, with some appearing shriveled or twisted. A few pods seem to have split open, revealing the seeds inside.\n\n- **Symptoms**: The presence of dark spots, blemishes, and discoloration suggests that the pods may be affected by some form of stress or damage. The splitting and distortion could indicate physical damage or disease.\n\nGiven these observations, the symptoms exhibited by the broad bean pods suggest they are likely affected by factors related to living organisms (such as pests or pathogens) rather than purely environmental or non-living factors. Therefore, the most appropriate classification for the symptoms observed would be \"Biotic.\""
