    "description": "The image is an infographic illustrating Dependency Theory, attributed to Raul Prebisch. The infographic is divided into two main sections: \"Center\" and \"Periphery,\" representing core and peripheral nations, respectively.\n\n### Center Section:\n- **Label:** \"Center\"\n- **Icons:** \n  - A graph with upward-trending lines, symbolizing economic growth or development.\n  - A factory icon, indicating industrialization.\n  - A cow, possibly representing agriculture but in the context of developed economies.\n- **Money Bags:** Two money bags, one labeled with a dollar sign ($) and the other with a euro sign (\u20ac), with \"80%\" written below them, suggesting that the center holds 80% of the wealth or resources.\n\n### Periphery Section:\n- **Label:** \"Periphery\"\n- **Icons:**\n  - A sad face, indicating underdevelopment or distress.\n  - A person with a flag behind them, labeled \"Dependent from Center,\" showing reliance on the center.\n- **Money Bag:** One money bag with a dollar sign ($), labeled \"20%,\" indicating that the periphery holds only 20% of the wealth or resources.\n- **Additional Labels:** \"Underdeveloped\" and \"Dependent from Center.\"\n\n### Arrows and Trade:\n- **Trade Arrow:** An arrow labeled \"Trade\" points from the center to the periphery, accompanied by a wallet and scissors, symbolizing the exchange or exploitation through trade.\n- **Control Arrow:** Another arrow points from the center to the periphery, labeled \"Total Control of Periphery,\" indicating the dominance of the center over the periphery.\n\n### Additional Information:\n- The infographic includes the text \"Universit\u00e4t Wien // EC EF 2 // WiSe 2018_19 // Mariya Kalugina // 11713382,\" which appears to be metadata about the creator and context of the image.\n\nBased on this description, the image explains global inequality and global stratification by focusing on the way that **Core nations exploit peripheral nations**. This is evident from the wealth distribution (80% vs. 20%), the control arrows, and the trade dynamics depicted in the infographic. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is:\n\n**D. Core nations exploit peripheral nations.**"
