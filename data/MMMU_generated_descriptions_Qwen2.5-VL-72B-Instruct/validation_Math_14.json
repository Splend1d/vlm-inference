    "description": "The image shows a graph of a function \\( y = f(x) \\) plotted on an x-y coordinate system. The x-axis ranges from -2 to 4, and the y-axis is labeled but no specific values are given for its scale. The curve of \\( y = f(x) \\) is smooth and continuous over this interval.\n\nTwo regions under the curve are shaded:\n- Region A: This is the area below the x-axis between \\( x = -2 \\) and \\( x = 0 \\). It is shaded with diagonal lines slanting downward to the right.\n- Region B: This is the area above the x-axis between \\( x = 0 \\) and \\( x = 4 \\). It is shaded with diagonal lines slanting upward to the right.\n\nThe areas of these regions are denoted as follows:\n- The area of region A is \\( a \\), which is negative because it lies below the x-axis.\n- The area of region B is \\( b \\), which is positive because it lies above the x-axis.\n\nThe problem introduces a new function \\( g(x) = f(x) + 3 \\). This means that the entire graph of \\( y = f(x) \\) is shifted upwards by 3 units. \n\nThe question asks for the average value of \\( g(x) \\) on the interval \\([-2, 4]\\). The average value of a function \\( h(x) \\) over an interval \\([c, d]\\) is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average value} = \\frac{1}{d-c} \\int_{c}^{d} h(x) \\, dx\n\\]\n\nFor \\( g(x) = f(x) + 3 \\) over the interval \\([-2, 4]\\):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average value of } g(x) = \\frac{1}{4 - (-2)} \\int_{-2}^{4} (f(x) + 3) \\, dx = \\frac{1}{6} \\left( \\int_{-2}^{4} f(x) \\, dx + \\int_{-2}^{4} 3 \\, dx \\right)\n\\]\n\nThe integral of \\( f(x) \\) over \\([-2, 4]\\) is the net signed area under the curve \\( f(x) \\), which is \\( b - a \\) (since \\( b \\) is positive and \\( a \\) is negative).\n\nThe integral of the constant 3 over \\([-2, 4]\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\int_{-2}^{4} 3 \\, dx = 3 \\times (4 - (-2)) = 3 \\times 6 = 18\n\\]\n\nThus, the average value of \\( g(x) \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{6} \\left( (b - a) + 18 \\right) = \\frac{b - a + 18}{6} = \\frac{-a + b}{6} + 3\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{-a + b}{6} + 3}\n\\]"
