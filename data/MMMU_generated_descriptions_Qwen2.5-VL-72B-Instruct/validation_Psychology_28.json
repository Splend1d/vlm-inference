    "description": "The image is a scatter plot with a smooth curve fitted through the data points. The x-axis is labeled \"Group Size\" and ranges from 1 to 12, indicating the number of individuals in a group. The y-axis is labeled \"Amount of Effort\" and ranges from 0 to 20, representing the level of effort exerted by the group members.\n\nThe data points show a clear downward trend as the group size increases. Specifically:\n\n- When the group size is 1, the amount of effort is approximately 20.\n- As the group size increases to 2, the amount of effort drops to around 14.\n- At a group size of 3, the effort further decreases to about 11.\n- By the time the group size reaches 7, the effort has dropped to roughly 9.\n- With a group size of 12, the effort is down to approximately 6.\n\nThe fitted curve illustrates a smooth, continuous decline in the amount of effort as the group size grows larger. This suggests that as more people join the group, each individual contributes less effort to the task at hand."
