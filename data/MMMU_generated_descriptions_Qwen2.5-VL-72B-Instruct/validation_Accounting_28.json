    "description": "The image is a table that outlines cost data for an unspecified business at three different client levels: 500 clients, 800 clients, and 900 clients. The table is divided into two main sections: \"Total Costs\" and \"Cost per Client.\"\n\n### **Total Costs Section**\nThis section includes:\n- **Fixed Costs**: Costs that remain constant regardless of the number of clients.\n- **Variable Costs**: Costs that change depending on the number of clients.\n- **Total Costs**: The sum of fixed and variable costs.\n\nFor each client level (500, 800, and 900), there are placeholders marked with \"?\" indicating that specific values need to be calculated or filled in.\n\n### **Cost per Client Section**\nThis section includes:\n- **Fixed Cost per Client**: Fixed costs divided by the number of clients.\n- **Variable Cost per Client**: Variable costs divided by the number of clients.\n- **Total Cost per Client**: The sum of fixed cost per client and variable cost per client.\n\nAgain, for each client level (500, 800, and 900), there are placeholders marked with \"?\" indicating that specific values need to be calculated or filled in.\n\n### **Additional Information from the Question**\nThe question provides additional context about Sanchez & Vukmin, LLP:\n- They provided tax preparation services to 500 clients last year.\n- Their total fixed costs were $265,000.\n- Their total variable costs were $180,000.\n\nUsing this information, you can calculate the total costs and cost per client for 500 clients:\n- **Total Costs for 500 Clients** = Fixed Costs + Variable Costs = $265,000 + $180,000 = $445,000.\n- **Fixed Cost per Client for 500 Clients** = Fixed Costs / Number of Clients = $265,000 / 500 = $530.\n- **Variable Cost per Client for 500 Clients** = Variable Costs / Number of Clients = $180,000 / 500 = $360.\n- **Total Cost per Client for 500 Clients** = Fixed Cost per Client + Variable Cost per Client = $530 + $360 = $890.\n\nTo find the total cost per 800 clients, you would assume that fixed costs remain the same ($265,000) while variable costs scale linearly with the number of clients. Therefore:\n- **Variable Costs for 800 Clients** = (Variable Costs for 500 Clients / 500) * 800 = ($180,000 / 500) * 800 = $288,000.\n- **Total Costs for 800 Clients** = Fixed Costs + Variable Costs = $265,000 + $288,000 = $553,000.\n- **Total Cost per Client for 800 Clients** = Total Costs for 800 Clients / 800 = $553,000 / 800 = $691.25.\n\nNone of the provided options match this calculation exactly, but it's closest to option B ($632,000). However, the exact value should be $553,000."
