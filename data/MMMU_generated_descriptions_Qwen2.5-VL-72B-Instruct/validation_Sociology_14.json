    "question": "Which of the following is a criticism of <image 1>?",
    "options": "['It is too broad and accounts for too many aspects of family.', 'It is too narrowly focused on a sequence of stages.', 'It does not serve a practical purpose for studying family behaviour.', 'It is not based on comprehensive research.']",
    "id": "validation_Sociology_14",
    "description": "The image is a diagram illustrating the \"Family life cycle.\" It consists of a central label, \"Family life cycle,\" surrounded by six rectangular boxes connected in a circular flow with arrows indicating the progression from one stage to the next. The stages listed in the boxes are:\n\n1. **Marriage** - This box is positioned at the top right.\n2. **Families with young children** - Located below the \"Marriage\" box.\n3. **Families with adolescents** - Positioned further down, below the \"Families with young children.\"\n4. **Launching children** - Situated to the left of the \"Families with adolescents.\"\n5. **Families in later life** - Above the \"Launching children.\"\n6. **Leaving home** - At the top left, completing the circle back to \"Marriage.\"\n\nEach stage is connected by an arrow pointing to the next stage, forming a continuous loop. The diagram suggests a linear progression through these stages, implying a typical sequence of events in a family's life cycle. \n\nThis description provides enough detail about the structure and content of the image to address the question regarding potential criticisms of the diagram."
