    "description": "The image depicts a dramatic and intense scene from the biblical story of Judith and Holofernes. Two women are shown in the act of beheading a man. The woman on the left, dressed in red with a white collar, is holding the head of the man while the other woman, wearing a blue dress with gold trim, assists her by gripping the man's hair. The man's body is partially visible, draped over what appears to be a bed or a similar piece of furniture, with blood visibly spilling onto the white sheets beneath him. The lighting is stark, with strong contrasts between light and shadow, highlighting the figures and creating a sense of tension and drama. The painting style is characterized by its realism, attention to detail, and use of chiaroscuro, which is a technique that employs strong contrasts between light and dark.\n\nThis particular version of the scene is known for its vivid portrayal of the moment and the emotional intensity it conveys. The artist who created this work is Artemisia Gentileschi, and it was painted between 1612 and 1613. The painting is notable for its powerful depiction of female agency and violence, themes that were somewhat unusual for the time but were explored by Gentileschi in her unique artistic style. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is C. Artemisia Gentileschi 1612-13."
