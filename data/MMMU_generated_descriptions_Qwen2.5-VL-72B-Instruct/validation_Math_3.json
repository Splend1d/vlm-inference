    "description": "The image consists of three labeled graphs: Graph 1, Graph 2, and Graph 3.\n\n**Graph 1:**\n- It has eight vertices labeled \\(a, b, c, d, e, f, g,\\) and \\(h\\).\n- The vertices form an outer octagon with edges connecting each adjacent vertex (\\(a-b, b-c, c-d, d-e, e-f, f-g, g-h, h-a\\)).\n- There are additional edges connecting each vertex to the center of the graph, forming a star-like pattern.\n- The center is not explicitly labeled but serves as a common connection point for all vertices.\n\n**Graph 2:**\n- It also has eight vertices labeled \\(a, b, c, d, e, f, g,\\) and \\(h\\).\n- The vertices form an outer octagon similar to Graph 1, with edges connecting each adjacent vertex (\\(a-b, b-c, c-d, d-e, e-f, f-g, g-h, h-a\\)).\n- Unlike Graph 1, there are no edges connecting the vertices to a central point. Instead, there are diagonal edges crossing inside the octagon, connecting opposite vertices (\\(a-e, b-f, c-g, d-h\\)).\n\n**Graph 3:**\n- This graph has eight vertices labeled \\(a, b, c, d, e, f, g,\\) and \\(h\\).\n- The vertices form two squares, one inside the other. The outer square has vertices \\(a, b, c,\\) and \\(d\\) connected in sequence (\\(a-b, b-c, c-d, d-a\\)), and the inner square has vertices \\(e, f, g,\\) and \\(h\\) connected in sequence (\\(e-f, f-g, g-h, h-e\\)).\n- There are diagonal edges connecting opposite vertices of the outer square (\\(a-c, b-d\\)) and the inner square (\\(e-g, f-h\\)).\n- Additionally, there are edges connecting corresponding vertices of the outer and inner squares (\\(a-e, b-f, c-g, d-h\\)).\n\nTo determine which graphs are not isomorphic:\n- **Graph 1** has a central vertex connected to all others, which is a unique feature not present in the other graphs.\n- **Graph 2** has a different internal structure with crossing diagonals but no central vertex.\n- **Graph 3** has a distinct structure with two separate squares and specific connections between them.\n\nThus, **Graph 1** is not isomorphic to **Graph 2** or **Graph 3** due to its central vertex feature. Similarly, **Graph 2** and **Graph 3** have different internal structures and are also not isomorphic to each other. Therefore, all three graphs are not isomorphic to each other."
