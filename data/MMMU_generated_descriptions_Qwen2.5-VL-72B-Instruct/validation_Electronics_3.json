    "description": "The image depicts a series RL circuit consisting of a resistor \\( R \\) and an inductor \\( L \\), connected in series. The resistor has a resistance value of \\( R = 1 \\Omega \\). A voltage source \\( v(t) \\) is applied across the circuit. The voltage source is described as a unit ramp function, mathematically represented as \\( v(t) = u_1(t) \\cdot t \\), where \\( u_1(t) \\) is the unit step function. This means the voltage source increases linearly with time starting from \\( t = 0 \\).\n\nThe circuit diagram includes the following components:\n- A voltage source \\( v(t) \\) labeled as a unit ramp function.\n- A resistor \\( R \\) with a value of \\( 1 \\Omega \\).\n- An inductor \\( L \\) with its voltage drop labeled as \\( v_L(t) \\).\n- The voltage across the resistor is labeled as \\( v_R(t) \\).\n\nThe question asks for the voltage \\( v_R(t) \\) across the resistor given zero initial conditions and an inductance \\( L = 0.1 \\text{ H} \\). The options provided for \\( v_R(t) \\) are:\nA. \\( t + \\frac{1}{10}(e^{-20t} - 1) \\text{ V} \\)\nB. \\( t + \\frac{1}{20}(e^{-10t} - 1) \\text{ V} \\)\nC. \\( t + \\frac{1}{10}(e^{-10t} - 1) \\text{ V} \\)\nD. \\( t - \\frac{1}{10}(e^{-10t} - 1) \\text{ V} \\)\n\nTo solve this problem, one would need to apply Kirchhoff's voltage law (KVL) to the series RL circuit and solve the resulting differential equation considering the unit ramp input and the specified values of \\( R \\) and \\( L \\). The solution involves finding the transient response due to the inductor and the steady-state response due to the ramp function."
