    "options": "[\"It is a prokaryote because it doesn't have a nucleus\", 'It is a eukaryotic cell because it has a cell wall and a nucleus', 'It is eukaryotic because it does not a nucleus nor a cell membrane', 'It is prokaryote because it has a cell wall']",

    "description": "The image shows a microscopic view of plant cells, which are clearly visible due to their rectangular shape and distinct cell walls. The cells are arranged in a grid-like pattern, with each cell separated by thick, dark lines representing the cell walls. Inside each cell, there are several small, round structures that appear to be nuclei, which are stained blue. Additionally, there are other smaller structures within the cells that could be organelles. The presence of these internal structures, including what appears to be a nucleus, indicates that these are eukaryotic cells. There are no visible signs of a single, large central structure that would suggest a prokaryotic cell, such as a bacterial cell. The overall organization and complexity of the internal structures further support the classification of these cells as eukaryotic."
