    "description": "The image shows a diagram of water molecules (H\u2082O) connected by dashed lines representing hydrogen bonds. There are four labeled arrows: \n\n- Arrow **a** points to a dashed line between an oxygen atom of one water molecule and a hydrogen atom of another water molecule.\n- Arrow **b** points to a solid line connecting an oxygen atom and a hydrogen atom within a single water molecule.\n- Arrow **c** points to a dashed line between an oxygen atom of one water molecule and a hydrogen atom of another water molecule.\n- Arrow **d** points to a solid line connecting an oxygen atom and a hydrogen atom within a single water molecule.\n\nThe dashed lines represent hydrogen bonds, while the solid lines represent covalent bonds within the water molecules. Therefore, arrows **a** and **c** point to hydrogen bonds."
