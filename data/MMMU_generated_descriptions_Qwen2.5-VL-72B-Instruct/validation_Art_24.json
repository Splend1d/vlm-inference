    "question": "Read the paragraph below regarding <image 1> and then answer the questions that follow. Elizabeth Catlett's sculpture tells a warm and tender story. It is a story of the unbreakable bond that unites a mother and her child. Like a good storyteller, Catlett is economical in her use of imagery. There are no visual frills or adornments, no reliance on gaudy color or superfluous detail. There is little more than fluidity of line and grace. Yet the sculpture speaks volumes about the deepest and most profound of all human relationships. Personification is a literary device in which human qualities are ascribed to a nonhuman subject. Which statement best captures the personification in the passage?",
    "options": "['The bond between mother and child is described as unbreakable.', 'A sculpture is described as speaking.', 'The artist is described as a storyteller.', 'A sculpture is without frills.']",

    "description": "The image depicts a wooden sculpture by Elizabeth Catlett, showcasing a mother holding her child. The sculpture is minimalist, with smooth, flowing lines and an absence of intricate details or embellishments. The figures are rendered in a simple yet graceful manner, emphasizing the bond between the mother and child. The mother stands upright, cradling the child close to her chest, with both figures sharing a sense of intimacy and connection. The material appears to be polished wood, giving the sculpture a warm and natural tone. The overall composition conveys a sense of tenderness and unity, focusing on the essential elements of the relationship rather than extraneous details. The sculpture itself is described as having the ability to \"speak volumes\" about the deep human connection it represents, despite its simplicity."
