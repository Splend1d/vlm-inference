    "description": "The image shows two gold wedding rings placed on a torn piece of paper. The paper appears to be a dictionary page with the word \"Divorce\" prominently displayed in bold letters. The definition of divorce is partially visible, mentioning \"the legal body.\" The tear runs through the middle of the word \"Divorce,\" symbolizing separation. There is no information in the image about who found evidence that divorce has been normalized or any reference to individuals named Postman, Oakley, Philips, Aries, Mitchel, or Woodey."
