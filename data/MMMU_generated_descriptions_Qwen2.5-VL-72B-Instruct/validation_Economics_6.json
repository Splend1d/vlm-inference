    "description": "The image presents a table showing the quantity demanded of DVDs at various prices, under two different income levels: $10,000 and $12,000. The table has three columns:\n\n1. **Price**: Lists the price of DVDs in dollars.\n2. **Quantity Demanded (income = $10,000)**: Shows the quantity of DVDs demanded at each price when the income is $10,000.\n3. **Quantity Demanded (income = $12,000)**: Shows the quantity of DVDs demanded at each price when the income is $12,000.\n\nThe data in the table is as follows:\n\n- At a price of $8:\n  - Quantity demanded with income $10,000: 40 DVDs\n  - Quantity demanded with income $12,000: 50 DVDs\n\n- At a price of $10:\n  - Quantity demanded with income $10,000: 32 DVDs\n  - Quantity demanded with income $12,000: 45 DVDs\n\n- At a price of $12:\n  - Quantity demanded with income $10,000: 24 DVDs\n  - Quantity demanded with income $12,000: 30 DVDs\n\n- At a price of $14:\n  - Quantity demanded with income $10,000: 16 DVDs\n  - Quantity demanded with income $12,000: 20 DVDs\n\n- At a price of $16:\n  - Quantity demanded with income $10,000: 8 DVDs\n  - Quantity demanded with income $12,000: 12 DVDs\n\nThis information is necessary to calculate the price elasticity of demand for DVDs when the price increases from $8 to $10 and the income is $12,000."
