    "description": "The image displays a scatter plot with two distinct sets of points, each representing a different class. One set consists of red triangles, while the other set consists of blue circles. The red triangles are primarily located on the left side of the plot, forming a somewhat scattered but generally linear pattern. The blue circles are predominantly situated on the right side of the plot, also forming a somewhat scattered but generally linear pattern. There is a clear separation between the two classes, with no overlap between the red triangles and blue circles. The boundary between the two classes appears to be a straight line, suggesting a linear separation. \n\nBased on this description, the ideal complexity of the curve that can be used for separating the two classes shown in the image is:\n\nA. Linear"
