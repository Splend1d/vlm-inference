    "question": "Based on <image 1>. When lines meet to form an enclosed area, this is formed.",
    "options": "['Space', 'Shape', 'Form', 'Line']",
    "id": "validation_Art_28",
    "description": "The image is titled \"Elements of Art\" and displays seven distinct elements, each represented by a visual example and labeled accordingly. The elements are arranged in two rows:\n\n**Top Row:**\n1. **Line:** This section shows various types of lines, including curved, straight, horizontal, vertical, and spiral lines.\n2. **Shape:** This section features geometric shapes like squares, triangles, and circles, some of which are filled with color while others are outlined.\n3. **Form:** This section illustrates three-dimensional forms, such as cubes, spheres, and cones, depicted with shading to give them depth.\n4. **Space:** This section demonstrates the concept of space using positive and negative space, with shapes placed apart from each other to create a sense of distance.\n\n**Bottom Row:**\n5. **Texture:** This section shows different textures, represented by patterns that suggest roughness or smoothness.\n6. **Value:** This section displays a range of values, from dark to light, using a gradient of colors.\n7. **Color:** This section presents a color wheel or a series of colored squares, showing various hues.\n\nEach element is visually distinct and labeled clearly beneath its corresponding illustration. The \"Shape\" section specifically shows enclosed areas formed by lines meeting, indicating the correct answer to the question."
