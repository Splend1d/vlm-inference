    "description": "The image shows three stages (labeled I, II, and III) of an experiment involving an electroscope and a negatively charged rod.\n\n- **Stage I**: An initially uncharged electroscope is depicted. The electroscope consists of a metal rod with two thin metallic leaves hanging from it. A negatively charged rod is brought near the top of the electroscope's metal rod, but it does not make contact. As a result, the leaves of the electroscope spring apart, indicating that they have acquired a charge.\n\n- **Stage II**: While the negatively charged rod remains close to the electroscope, a finger touches the top of the electroscope's metal rod. Upon this contact, the leaves of the electroscope collapse, suggesting that the charge on the leaves has been neutralized or altered.\n\n- **Stage III**: After the finger is removed, followed by the removal of the negatively charged rod, the leaves of the electroscope spring apart again. This indicates that the leaves now carry a charge once more.\n\nThe question asks about the nature of the charge on the leaves in stages I and III. Based on the described behavior of the electroscope in these stages, the correct answer can be determined."
