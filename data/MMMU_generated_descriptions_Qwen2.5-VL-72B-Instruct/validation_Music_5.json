    "description": "The image shows a musical staff with a single note placed on the second line from the bottom. The note is a natural A (A\u266e). To the right of the staff, there is a statement: \"This is the supertonic in Gb major.\" Below this statement, two options are provided: \"TRUE\" and \"FALSE.\"\n\nTo determine whether the statement is true or false, one would need to know the scale of Gb major and identify the supertonic degree within that scale. The supertonic is the second degree of the scale. In Gb major, the notes of the scale are Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F, and back to Gb. Therefore, the supertonic in Gb major is Ab, not A\u266e. \n\nThus, the statement is false."
