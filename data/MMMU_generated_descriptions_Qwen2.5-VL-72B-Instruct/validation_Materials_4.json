    "description": "The image depicts a mechanical structure with a load applied to it. The structure consists of a horizontal arm extending from point E to point A, followed by a vertical segment from A to D. The dimensions provided include:\n\n- The horizontal distance from E to A is 600 mm.\n- The vertical distance from A to D is 300 mm.\n- The cross-sectional dimensions at section a-a are given as follows:\n  - The width of the top flange is 25 mm.\n  - The thickness of the top flange is 20 mm.\n  - The height of the web is 50 mm.\n  - The thickness of the web is 25 mm.\n  - The width of the bottom flange is 25 mm.\n  - The thickness of the bottom flange is 25 mm.\n\nA force \\( P \\) is applied vertically downward at point E. The value of \\( P \\) is given as 3 kN. The question asks for the bending stress developed at point B of the cross-section at section a-a.\n\nTo solve this problem, one would need to calculate the moment at section a-a due to the applied force \\( P \\), then use the moment of inertia and the distance from the neutral axis to point B to find the bending stress using the formula \\( \\sigma = \\frac{My}{I} \\), where \\( M \\) is the bending moment, \\( y \\) is the distance from the neutral axis to point B, and \\( I \\) is the moment of inertia of the cross-section. The correct answer among the options provided is C. 43.7 MPa."
