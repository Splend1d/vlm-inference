    "description": "The image depicts an electrolysis setup involving water. There is a large container filled with a clear liquid, presumably water, which has two electrodes submerged in it. These electrodes are connected by wires to an external power source (not shown in the image). The electrodes are labeled \"A\" and \"B,\" with \"A\" being on the left side and \"B\" on the right side. \n\nAbove each electrode, there are two vertical tubes extending upwards out of the container. These tubes are used to collect gases produced during the electrolysis process. The tube above electrode A appears to contain a smaller volume of gas compared to the tube above electrode B, which contains a visibly larger volume of gas. This suggests that more gas is being produced at electrode B than at electrode A. \n\nIn the context of water electrolysis, hydrogen gas is produced at the cathode, while oxygen gas is produced at the anode. Since hydrogen gas is produced in a greater volume compared to oxygen (a 2:1 ratio), the electrode producing the larger volume of gas is where hydrogen is being generated. Therefore, based on the volumes of gas collected in the tubes, hydrogen is being produced at electrode B."
