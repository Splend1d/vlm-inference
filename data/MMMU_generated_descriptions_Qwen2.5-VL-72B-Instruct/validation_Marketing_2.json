    "description": "The image displays a table labeled \"Table 12.14,\" which contains data related to the number of goals scored by girls from four different soccer teams across five games. The table has four columns, each representing a different team (Team 1, Team 2, Team 3, and Team 4), and five rows, each corresponding to a different game. \n\nHere is the detailed breakdown of the table:\n\n- **Team 1:** Scores for five games are 1, 2, 0, 3, and 2.\n- **Team 2:** Scores for five games are 2, 3, 2, 4, and 4.\n- **Team 3:** Scores for five games are 0, 1, 1, 0, and 0.\n- **Team 4:** Scores for five games are 3, 4, 4, 3, and 2.\n\nThe table provides the necessary data to calculate statistical measures like the mean goals scored per game for each team. For the purpose of answering the question about degrees of freedom (df) for the numerator in an ANOVA test, it's important to note that there are four groups (teams). The formula for the degrees of freedom for the numerator in this context is \\( k - 1 \\), where \\( k \\) is the number of groups. Therefore, with four teams, the df for the numerator would be \\( 4 - 1 = 3 \\)."
