    "question": "A 70-year-old woman collapses suddenly after ambulating to the bathroom from her hospital bed. At autopsy she has the gross pathologic finding shown here. Which of the following conditions is the most likely risk factor for development of this woman's immediate cause of death? <image 1> ",
    "options": "['Blunt chest trauma', 'Inhalation of inorganic dusts', 'Prolonged immobilization', 'Bronchopneumonia']",

    "description": "The image depicts an internal view of a thoracic cavity during an autopsy. The focus is on the heart and surrounding structures. There is a large, dark, irregular mass located within the right atrium of the heart. This mass appears to be a thrombus (blood clot) that has formed and is lodged in the atrium. The surrounding tissues show signs of congestion and hemorrhage, with blood pooling around the area. The clot itself is dark in color, suggesting it may have been present for some time before the patient's death. The rest of the heart and surrounding structures appear relatively normal, with no obvious signs of trauma or other significant abnormalities.\n\nGiven the presence of a large thrombus in the right atrium, the most likely immediate cause of death is a pulmonary embolism, where the clot traveled from the venous system to the lungs, blocking blood flow and leading to sudden collapse. \n\nConsidering the options provided:\n\nA. Blunt chest trauma - There are no signs of external or internal trauma in the image.\nB. Inhalation of inorganic dusts - This would typically lead to lung-related issues rather than a thrombus in the heart.\nC. Prolonged immobilization - This is a known risk factor for the development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which can lead to pulmonary embolism if the clot travels to the lungs.\nD. Bronchopneumonia - While this can cause respiratory distress, it does not directly explain the presence of a thrombus in the heart.\n\nTherefore, the most likely risk factor for the development of this woman's immediate cause of death is prolonged immobilization."
