    "description": "The image shows a musical staff with a bass clef symbol at the beginning. On this staff, there are two notes: an F in the second space from the bottom and a D in the fourth space from the bottom. The D note has a sharp symbol (#) next to it, indicating that it is a D#. There is also a small circle with a line through it (a natural sign) placed between the two notes, which typically indicates a cancellation of any previous accidentals but does not affect the D# in this context since it is directly written. The interval between F and D# spans four lines and three spaces, making it a sixth interval. Since the D is sharpened, the interval is larger than a major sixth, thus making it an augmented sixth."
