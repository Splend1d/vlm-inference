    "description": "The image presents two financial statements for Eagle Sport Supply:\n\n### Income Statement:\n- **Sales**: $950\n- **Costs**: $250 (Note: Costs include interest)\n- **Pretax income**: $700\n- **Taxes (at 28.6%)**: $200\n- **Net income**: $500\n\n### Balance Sheet, Year-End:\n#### 2019:\n- **Net assets**: $3,000\n- **Debt**: $1,000\n- **Equity**: $2,000\n- **Total**: $3,000\n\n#### 2018:\n- **Net assets**: $2,700\n- **Debt**: $900\n- **Equity**: $1,800\n- **Total**: $2,700\n\n### Additional Information:\n- The question assumes that Eagle's assets are proportional to its sales.\n- The company maintains a dividend payout ratio of 50%.\n- The planned growth rate for 2020 is 15%.\n\n### Calculation Steps:\n1. **Calculate Retained Earnings**:\n   - Dividend payout ratio = 50%\n   - Retained earnings ratio = 1 - 50% = 50%\n   - Retained earnings = Net income * Retained earnings ratio = $500 * 0.5 = $250\n\n2. **Calculate Increase in Sales**:\n   - Planned growth rate = 15%\n   - Increase in sales = Current sales * Growth rate = $950 * 0.15 = $142.5\n\n3. **Calculate Increase in Assets**:\n   - Assets are proportional to sales.\n   - Increase in assets = Increase in sales * (Net assets / Sales) = $142.5 * ($3,000 / $950) = $450\n\n4. **Calculate Increase in Spontaneous Liabilities**:\n   - Assume no spontaneous liabilities (not provided in the data).\n\n5. **Calculate Required External Funds (REF)**:\n   - REF = Increase in assets - Increase in spontaneous liabilities - Retained earnings\n   - REF = $450 - $0 - $250 = $200\n\nHowever, this calculation does not match any of the given options. There might be an error or additional assumptions needed. Given the options, the closest value would be:\n\n**B. $162.5**\n\nThis value could be due to rounding or additional factors not explicitly stated but implied in the problem setup."
