    "description": "The image presents data from a prospective cohort study examining the relationship between exposure (likely representing smoking) and the incidence of a condition (likely lung cancer). The data is organized into two groups: an \"exposure group\" and a \"non-exposed group.\" Each group has four columns: \"case,\" \"Non-case,\" \"total,\" and \"incidence (/ 100 thousands).\" \n\nHere's the detailed breakdown:\n\n- **Exposure Group**:\n  - Case: 58 individuals developed the condition.\n  - Non-case: 99,942 individuals did not develop the condition.\n  - Total: 100,000 individuals in this group.\n  - Incidence: 58 per 100,000 individuals.\n\n- **Non-exposed Group**:\n  - Case: 5 individuals developed the condition.\n  - Non-case: 99,995 individuals did not develop the condition.\n  - Total: 100,000 individuals in this group.\n  - Incidence: 5 per 100,000 individuals.\n\nThe attributable risk (AR) is calculated by subtracting the incidence rate in the non-exposed group from the incidence rate in the exposed group. In this case, AR = 58/100,000 - 5/100,000 = 53/100,000. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is B. 53.0/100000."
