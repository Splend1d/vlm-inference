    "question": "The adjacency list of a directed graph is given as follows. Starting from the vertex V1 and traversing according to the depth-first search method, the obtained vertex sequence is<image 1>",
    "options": "['V1,V5,V4,V7,V6,V2,V3', 'V1,V2,V3,V4,V7,V6,V5', 'V1,V5,V4,V7,V6,V3,V2', 'V1,V5,V6,V4,V7,V2,V3']",

    "description": "The image represents an adjacency list for a directed graph with vertices labeled V1 through V7. The adjacency list is structured as follows:\n\n- **V1**: Points to V5.\n- **V2**: Points to V3.\n- **V3**: Has no outgoing edges (indicated by \"/\").\n- **V4**: Points to V7.\n- **V5**: Points to V3 and V4.\n- **V6**: Has no outgoing edges (indicated by \"/\").\n- **V7**: Points to V6.\n\nEach vertex is listed in a column, followed by its adjacent vertices in the next columns. A slash \"/\" indicates that there are no further adjacent vertices for that particular vertex.\n\nTo perform a depth-first search starting from V1, you would follow these steps:\n1. Start at V1 and visit V5.\n2. From V5, visit V3.\n3. Since V3 has no outgoing edges, backtrack to V5 and then visit V4.\n4. From V4, visit V7.\n5. From V7, visit V6.\n6. Since V6 has no outgoing edges, backtrack until all vertices have been visited.\n\nThus, the sequence of vertices visited using depth-first search starting from V1 is: **V1, V5, V3, V4, V7, V6**. \n\nGiven the options provided, the correct sequence that matches this traversal is:\n\nA. V1, V5, V4, V7, V6, V2, V3  \nB. V1, V2, V3, V4, V7, V6, V5  \nC. V1, V5, V4, V7, V6, V3, V2  \nD. V1, V5, V6, V4, V7, V2, V3  \n\nNone of the options perfectly match the described sequence. However, option C is closest, differing only in the order of V2 and V3 at the end. This discrepancy might be due to additional backtracking or revisiting nodes not explicitly detailed in the adjacency list."
