    "question": "<image 1> Is it possible to cultivate in a lab the black fungus, commonly known as sooty mould, that typically grows on leaf surfaces, even though its name is indicative of a condition and not a distinct fungal species?",
    "options": "['Some of the fungi can be grown in culture but not all', \"Don't know and don't want to guess\", 'They will only grow if honey dew is included in the media', 'Yes, the fungi that make up the sooty mould family can be grown in culture.', 'It is not possible to grow these fungi in culture']",

    "description": "The image shows a close-up view of leaves from a plant, likely a tree or shrub. The leaves are elongated with a smooth margin and prominent veins. Several leaves exhibit significant discoloration and damage. The affected areas appear dark, almost black, with a texture that resembles a coating or growth on the surface of the leaves. This darkened area covers large portions of some leaves, while others remain mostly green with only minor spots of the dark substance. The dark patches have an irregular shape and seem to be concentrated more heavily on certain parts of the leaves, particularly along the edges and near the midrib. The overall appearance suggests the presence of sooty mold, a type of fungal growth that often appears as a black, velvety coating on plant surfaces. Sooty mold is typically associated with the presence of honeydew, a sugary substance excreted by sap-sucking insects like aphids, mealybugs, or scale insects. The mold itself does not directly harm the plant but can block sunlight and reduce photosynthesis efficiency. The image does not show any insects, but their presence is implied by the sooty mold. The background includes other healthy-looking leaves and branches, indicating that the plant is still alive and growing despite the fungal infection. The lighting in the image suggests it was taken outdoors during daylight hours."
