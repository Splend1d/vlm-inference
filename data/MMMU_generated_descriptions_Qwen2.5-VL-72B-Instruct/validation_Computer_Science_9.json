    "question": "Consider the scenario shown below, with four different servers connected to four different clients over four three-hop paths. The four pairs share a common middle hop with a transmission capacity of R = 300 Mbps. The four links from the servers to the shared link have a transmission capacity of RS = 80 Mbps. Each of the four links from the shared middle link to a client has a transmission capacity of RC = 60 Mbps. <image 1> What is the maximum achievable end-end throughput (in Mbps) for each of four client-to-server pairs, assuming that the middle link is fairly shared (divides its transmission rate equally)? Omit the unit of Mbps.",

    "description": "The image depicts a network topology consisting of four servers and four clients connected through a central hub. The connections form a star-like structure where all communication between servers and clients passes through the central hub.\n\n### Servers:\n- There are four servers, each labeled with a transmission capacity \\( R_S \\) of 80 Mbps.\n- Each server connects directly to the central hub via a dedicated link.\n\n### Central Hub:\n- The central hub acts as the middle point in the network and has a total transmission capacity \\( R \\) of 300 Mbps.\n- This hub is responsible for routing data between the servers and clients.\n- The hub is depicted as a cylindrical shape with a blue cloud surrounding it, symbolizing its role as the central node.\n\n### Clients:\n- There are four clients, each labeled with a transmission capacity \\( R_C \\) of 60 Mbps.\n- Each client also connects directly to the central hub via a dedicated link.\n\n### Links:\n- The links connecting the servers to the central hub are labeled with \\( R_S = 80 \\) Mbps.\n- The links connecting the central hub to the clients are labeled with \\( R_C = 60 \\) Mbps.\n- All these links are represented by bidirectional arrows indicating the flow of data in both directions.\n\n### Network Paths:\n- Each server-client pair forms a three-hop path: Server \u2192 Central Hub \u2192 Client.\n- Since there are four server-client pairs, they share the central hub's capacity of 300 Mbps.\n\n### Fair Sharing Assumption:\n- The question assumes that the central hub fairly shares its transmission capacity among the four pairs. Therefore, the 300 Mbps capacity is divided equally among the four pairs, giving each pair an equal share of the hub's bandwidth.\n\n### Calculation:\n- With fair sharing, each of the four pairs gets \\( \\frac{300}{4} = 75 \\) Mbps from the central hub.\n- However, the bottleneck for each pair is determined by the minimum capacity along the path. For each pair, this is limited by the client-side link capacity \\( R_C = 60 \\) Mbps.\n\nThus, the maximum achievable end-to-end throughput for each of the four client-to-server pairs is **60**."
