    "question": "A researcher recorded systolic blood pressure and body mass index in 10 men aged 35-45 years, and the data are shown in the table below. <image 1> If both systolic blood pressure and body mass index follow a normal distribution, and the information is analyzed by correlation and regression, respectively, the relationship between tr and tb is",

    "description": "The image displays a table with two rows and eleven columns. The first row is labeled \"systolic blood pressure/mmHg,\" and it lists the following values: 118, 122, 128, 134, 144, 128, 162, 154, 146, and 128. The second row is labeled \"BMI\" (body mass index), and it lists the following values: 19, 22, 28, 29, 34, 21, 32, 38, 22, and 21. The table provides paired measurements of systolic blood pressure and BMI for ten individuals. The question asks about the relationship between the correlation coefficient (tr) and the regression coefficient (tb) assuming both variables follow a normal distribution."
