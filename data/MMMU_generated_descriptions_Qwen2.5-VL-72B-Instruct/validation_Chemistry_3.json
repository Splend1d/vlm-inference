    "question": "<image 1> Which statement is incorrect in respect of the above reaction ?",
    "options": "['Product is aromatic', 'Product has high dipole moment', 'Product has less resonance energy', 'Product is soluble in polar solvent']",

    "description": "The image depicts a chemical reaction involving a brominated benzene derivative. The structure shown is a six-membered ring with alternating double bonds (indicating an aromatic system) and a bromine (Br) atom attached to one of the carbon atoms. This compound is reacting with silver nitrate (AgNO\u2083), leading to the formation of a product labeled as (A).\n\nThe reaction suggests a substitution or elimination process where the bromine atom may be replaced or removed under the influence of AgNO\u2083. Given the aromatic nature of the starting material, it is reasonable to infer that the product (A) will retain some degree of aromatic character unless the reaction disrupts the aromaticity significantly.\n\nThe options provided for evaluation include statements about the product's aromaticity, dipole moment, resonance energy, and solubility in polar solvents. These properties are directly related to the structure and electronic characteristics of the product formed from the given reactants."
