    "description": "The image shows an outdoor caf\u00e9 setting with several people seated at tables, enjoying food and drinks. The scene appears to be in a sunny urban area with brick-paved ground and buildings in the background. In the foreground, there is a woman standing near a table where two individuals are seated. She is dressed casually in a dark blue T-shirt and brown pants, and she seems to be interacting with the seated individuals. Her posture suggests she might be taking orders or serving them, as she is leaning slightly forward and appears to be engaged in conversation with them. However, her attire does not resemble typical waitress uniforms, which often include aprons or more formal clothing. The caption below the image reads: \"Figure 2.7. Is she a working waitress or a sociologist conducting a study using participant observation?\" This caption directly poses the question about her role, leaving room for ambiguity. Based on the visual cues alone, it is not definitively clear whether she is a waitress or a sociologist. Therefore, the most accurate response would be:\n\nC. Not sure"
