    "description": "The image depicts a simple electrical circuit consisting of two parallel branches connected to a power source represented by a battery symbol at the bottom. The circuit includes six resistors, all of which have the same resistance value. \n\nThe top branch of the circuit consists of three resistors connected in series. These resistors are labeled from left to right as follows: the first resistor is connected to point W, the second resistor is connected to point U, and the third resistor is connected to point P. \n\nThe bottom branch also consists of three resistors connected in series. These resistors are labeled from left to right as follows: the first resistor is connected to point T, the second resistor is connected to point S, and the third resistor is connected to point Q. Points T and P are connected directly to the positive and negative terminals of the battery, respectively.\n\nPoints W and S are located at the junctions where the top and bottom branches connect to the rest of the circuit. Points U and Q are located midway along their respective branches. \n\nThe question asks about connecting a voltmeter with very high resistance between two points in the circuit and determining where the voltmeter would read zero. The options provided for these points are A. Q and U, B. P and T, C. Q and W, D. S and U."
