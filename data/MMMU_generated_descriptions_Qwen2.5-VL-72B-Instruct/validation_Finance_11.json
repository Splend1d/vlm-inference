The table includes the initial investment and annual rate of return under three scenarios: pessimistic, most likely, and optimistic.\n\n- **Initial Investment**: Both Expansion A and Expansion B have an initial investment of $12,000.\n  \n- **Annual Rate of Return**:\n    - **Pessimistic Scenario**:\n        - Expansion A has a pessimistic annual rate of return of 16%.\n        - Expansion B has a pessimistic annual rate of return of 10%.\n    - **Most Likely Scenario**:\n        - Expansion A has a most likely annual rate of return of 20%.\n        - Expansion B also has a most likely annual rate of return of 20%.\n    - **Optimistic Scenario**:\n        - Expansion A has an optimistic annual rate of return of 24%.\n        - Expansion B has an optimistic annual rate of return of 30%.\n\nThis information allows us to determine the range of the rates of return for each project. For Expansion A, the range is from the pessimistic value (16%) to the optimistic value (24%). For Expansion B, the range is from the pessimistic value (10%) to the optimistic value (30%)."
