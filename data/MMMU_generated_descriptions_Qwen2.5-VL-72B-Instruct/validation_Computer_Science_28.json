    "description": "The provided images consist of two parts:\n\n### Image 1:\nThis image shows two scatter plots, each depicting a dataset with two classes represented by different symbols: circles (\u25cb) and plus signs (+). The plots are identical in structure but differ slightly in the positioning of the points.\n\n- **Axes**: Each plot has two axes labeled \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\), representing the features of the data.\n- **Classes**: \n  - Circles (\u25cb) represent one class, clustered around the top-right quadrant.\n  - Plus signs (+) represent another class, clustered around the bottom-left quadrant.\n- **Decision Boundary**: A dashed line separates the two classes. This line appears to be vertical, suggesting that the feature \\(x_1\\) plays a significant role in separating the classes. The horizontal position of this line indicates that \\(x_2\\) may have less influence on the separation compared to \\(x_1\\).\n\n### Image 2:\nThis image displays a mathematical expression related to logistic regression with L1 regularization:\n\n\\[ \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\log P(y_i | x_i, w_0, w_1, w_2) - C(|w_1| + |w_2|) \\]\n\n- **Log Likelihood Term**: The first term represents the log likelihood of the data given the parameters \\(w_0\\), \\(w_1\\), and \\(w_2\\).\n- **Regularization Term**: The second term is the L1 regularization penalty, where \\(C\\) is the regularization parameter, and \\(|w_1|\\) and \\(|w_2|\\) are the absolute values of the coefficients for features \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\), respectively.\n\n### Contextual Information:\n- **L1 Regularization**: As \\(C\\) increases, the regularization term grows, pushing the coefficients \\(w_1\\) and \\(w_2\\) towards zero. The goal is to minimize the overall expression, which includes both the log likelihood and the regularization terms.\n- **Feature Importance**: Based on the scatter plots, \\(x_1\\) seems more important for classification than \\(x_2\\), as the decision boundary is primarily aligned with \\(x_1\\).\n\n### Answering the Question:\nGiven the information from the images:\n- Since \\(x_1\\) is more influential in separating the classes, its coefficient \\(w_1\\) will likely remain non-zero longer than \\(w_2\\).\n- As \\(C\\) increases, \\(w_2\\) (the less influential feature) will become zero first, followed by \\(w_1\\) if \\(C\\) continues to grow.\n\nThus, the correct option is:\n**A. First, \\(w_2\\) becomes zero, and then \\(w_1\\) becomes zero.**"
