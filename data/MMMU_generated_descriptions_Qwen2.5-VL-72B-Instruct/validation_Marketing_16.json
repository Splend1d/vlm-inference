    "description": "The image presents a table titled \"Table 1.14 Flossing Frequency for Adults with Gum Disease.\" This table records data on how often adults with gum disease used to floss before their diagnosis. The table has four columns: \n\n1. **# flossing per week**: This column lists the number of times individuals flossed per week. The values provided are 0, 1, 3, 6, and 7.\n   \n2. **Frequency**: This column shows the count of individuals corresponding to each flossing frequency. The values given are:\n   - 27 for 0 times per week,\n   - 18 for 1 time per week,\n   - An unspecified value for 3 times per week,\n   - 3 for 6 times per week,\n   - 1 for 7 times per week.\n\n3. **Relative frequency**: This column provides the proportion of individuals for each flossing frequency relative to the total number of respondents. The values listed are:\n   - 0.4500 for 0 times per week,\n   - An unspecified value for 1 time per week,\n   - An unspecified value for 3 times per week,\n   - 0.0500 for 6 times per week,\n   - 0.0167 for 7 times per week.\n\n4. **Cumulative relative frequency**: This column shows the cumulative sum of the relative frequencies up to each row. The only specified value is 0.9333 for the row where the number of times flossing per week is 3.\n\nThe question asks what percentage of the surveyed adults flossed at most three times per week. To find this, one would need to consider the cumulative relative frequency up to and including the row for 3 times per week, which is given as 0.9333. Converting this to a percentage gives 93.33%. Therefore, the correct answer is C. 93.33%."
