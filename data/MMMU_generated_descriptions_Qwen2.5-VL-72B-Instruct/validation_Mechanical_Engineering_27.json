    "description": "The image depicts a quarter-circular gate labeled AB, which is submerged in water. The gate has a radius \\( r \\) of 8 feet and is 10 feet wide into the plane of the paper (perpendicular to the page). The gate is hinged at point B, located at the bottom left corner of the quarter-circle. Point A is at the top right corner of the quarter-circle where a vertical force \\( F \\) acts downward. \n\nThe gate is uniform and weighs 3000 pounds-force (lbf). The water exerts a hydrostatic pressure on the gate, which varies linearly with depth. The pressure at any point on the gate is given by \\( P = \\rho g h \\), where \\( \\rho \\) is the density of water, \\( g \\) is the acceleration due to gravity, and \\( h \\) is the depth below the water surface. \n\nTo find the force \\( F \\) required to keep the gate closed, one must consider the moments about the hinge B. The moment due to the weight of the gate, the hydrostatic force acting on the gate, and the applied force \\( F \\) must be balanced. The hydrostatic force acts at the centroid of the submerged area, which for a quarter-circle is located at \\( \\frac{4r}{3\\pi} \\) from the bottom. \n\nGiven these details, the force \\( F \\) can be calculated using the principle of moments, ensuring that the sum of the moments about point B is zero. The correct value of \\( F \\) is one of the options provided: A. 7490 lbf, B. 7470 lbf, or C. 7480 lbf."
