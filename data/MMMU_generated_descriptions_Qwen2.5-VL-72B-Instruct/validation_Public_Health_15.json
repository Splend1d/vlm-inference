    "description": "The image presents a contingency table summarizing survey results about exceeding speed limits, categorized by age groups. The table has three columns: \"Always,\" \"Not Always,\" and \"Total,\" which represent responses to whether individuals exceed speed limits when possible. There are two rows for age categories: \"Under 30\" and \"Over 30,\" along with a \"Total\" row at the bottom.\n\nHere's the detailed breakdown:\n\n- **Under 30**:\n  - Always: 100 people\n  - Not Always: 100 people\n  - Total: 200 people\n\n- **Over 30**:\n  - Always: 40 people\n  - Not Always: 160 people\n  - Total: 200 people\n\n- **Total** (across all ages):\n  - Always: 140 people\n  - Not Always: 260 people\n  - Total: 400 people\n\nThis table provides the necessary data to calculate the odds for people under 30 who always exceed the speed limit. Specifically, among those under 30, 100 people always exceed the speed limit, while 100 do not always exceed it."
