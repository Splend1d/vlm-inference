    "question": "Among the following, the Newmann projections of meso-2, 3-butanediol are : <image 1>",
    "options": "['P, Q', 'P, R', 'R, S', 'Q, S']",
    "id": "validation_Chemistry_17",
    "description": "The image displays four Newman projections labeled P, Q, R, and S, representing different conformations of a molecule with specific substituents. Each projection shows a carbon-carbon bond viewed along its axis, with three groups attached to each carbon atom depicted in a staggered conformation.\n\n- **P**: The front carbon has a methyl (Me) group at the top and a hydrogen (H) at the bottom. The back carbon has a hydroxyl (OH) group at the top and a hydrogen (H) at the bottom. Both carbons have a methyl (Me) group on the right side.\n  \n- **Q**: The front carbon has a methyl (Me) group at the top and a hydrogen (H) at the bottom. The back carbon has a hydroxyl (OH) group at the top and a methyl (Me) group at the bottom. Both carbons have a hydroxyl (OH) group on the right side.\n  \n- **R**: The front carbon has a hydroxyl (OH) group at the top and a hydrogen (H) at the bottom. The back carbon has a methyl (Me) group at the top and a hydrogen (H) at the bottom. Both carbons have a methyl (Me) group on the right side.\n  \n- **S**: The front carbon has a methyl (Me) group at the top and a hydrogen (H) at the bottom. The back carbon has a hydroxyl (OH) group at the top and a hydrogen (H) at the bottom. Both carbons have a hydroxyl (OH) group on the right side.\n\nThe question asks for the Newman projections of meso-2,3-butanediol. Meso-2,3-butanediol is a chiral molecule with two stereocenters but is optically inactive due to an internal plane of symmetry. The correct Newman projections should show this internal symmetry. Based on the descriptions:\n\n- **P** and **R** show the same arrangement of groups but rotated by 180 degrees, indicating the internal plane of symmetry characteristic of meso-2,3-butanediol.\n  \nThus, the correct answer is B. P, R."
