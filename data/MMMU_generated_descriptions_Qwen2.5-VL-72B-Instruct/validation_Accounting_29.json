    "description": "The image presents a table comparing two call options, labeled A and B, with their respective parameters:\n\n- **Option A**:\n  - Time to expiration (T): 0.5 years\n  - Strike price (X): $50\n  - Stock price (S): $55\n  - Price of the option: $10\n\n- **Option B**:\n  - Time to expiration (T): 0.5 years\n  - Strike price (X): $50\n  - Stock price (S): $55\n  - Price of the option: $12\n\nBoth options have identical time to expiration, strike price, and stock price. However, the price of Option B ($12) is higher than the price of Option A ($10). \n\nGiven that all other factors are equal, the difference in the option prices suggests that Option B is likely written on the stock with higher volatility. Higher volatility typically leads to higher option prices because it increases the probability of the underlying asset reaching or exceeding the strike price by the expiration date. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. B"
