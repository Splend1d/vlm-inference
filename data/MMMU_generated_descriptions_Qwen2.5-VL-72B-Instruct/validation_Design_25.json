    "description": "The image is a painting featuring a series of scenes arranged in a vertical composition. The artwork depicts various individuals seated at tables, engaged in different activities such as eating, reading, and writing. The figures are rendered in a stylized manner with simplified forms and bold outlines. The color palette is limited, with a focus on earthy tones and muted colors. A prominent yellow line runs vertically through the center of the painting, connecting the different scenes. The style of the painting is reminiscent of mid-20th-century modernist art, characterized by its narrative structure and social commentary. The artist who created this work is known for their series of paintings that explore themes of race, identity, and history in America. The specific style and thematic content of this painting align closely with the works of Jacob Lawrence, an African American painter who is famous for his narrative series depicting historical events and everyday life. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is D. Jacob Lawrence."
