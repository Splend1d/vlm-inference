    "question": "An acetal polymer block is fixed to the rigid plates at its top and bottom surfaces. If the top plate displaces 2 mm horizontally when it is subjected to a horizontal force P=2 kN, determine the shear modulus of the polymer. The width of the block is 100 mm. Assume that the polymer is linearly elastic and use small angle analysis. <image 1>",

    "description": "The image depicts an acetal polymer block with dimensions of 400 mm in length (horizontal) and 200 mm in height (vertical). The block is fixed between two rigid plates: one at the top and one at the bottom. A horizontal force \\( P = 2 \\text{ kN} \\) is applied to the top plate, causing it to displace horizontally by 2 mm. The width of the block, which is perpendicular to the plane of the image, is given as 100 mm. The problem assumes that the polymer behaves linearly elastically and allows for the use of small angle approximations. The goal is to determine the shear modulus of the polymer based on the provided data. \n\nThe options for the shear modulus are:\nA. 15 MPa  \nB. 5 MPa  \nC. 20 MPa  \nD. 2 MPa  \n\nThe image provides all necessary geometric and force-related information required to solve for the shear modulus using the principles of elasticity and shear deformation."
