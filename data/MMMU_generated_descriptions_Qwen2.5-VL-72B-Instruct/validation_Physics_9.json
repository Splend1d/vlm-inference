    "description": "The image depicts a uniform rod that is supported by a vertical wall at one end (point 1) and a rope attached to the other end of the rod. The rod is inclined at an angle with respect to the horizontal. There are four labeled points along the rod: Point 1 is where the rod is fixed to the wall, Point 2 is located vertically below Point 1 on the wall, Point 3 is somewhere along the length of the rod, and Point 4 is at the far end of the rod where it is connected to the rope. The rod's weight acts downward through its center of mass, which is assumed to be at the midpoint of the rod due to its uniformity. The rope exerts an upward force on the rod at Point 4. The goal is to determine the force exerted by the rope using torque calculations around a specific point."
