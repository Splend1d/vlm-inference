    "description": "The image depicts a rectangular piece of rubber with dimensions labeled before and after deformation. The original rectangle has vertices labeled A, B, C, and D. The coordinates and dimensions are as follows:\n\n- **AB** (horizontal side): 300 mm in length.\n- **AD** (vertical side): 400 mm in length.\n- After deformation, the new positions of points C and D are slightly shifted, indicated by dashed lines.\n- The horizontal shift at point D is 3 mm to the right.\n- The vertical shift at point B is 2 mm downward.\n\nThe deformation causes the rectangle to become a parallelogram. The goal is to determine the average normal strain along the side AD. \n\nTo calculate the average normal strain along AD:\n\\[ \\text{Average normal strain} = \\frac{\\Delta L}{L_0} \\]\nwhere \\( \\Delta L \\) is the change in length and \\( L_0 \\) is the original length.\n\nSince the deformation shifts point D horizontally by 3 mm but does not change its vertical position relative to A, the length AD remains 400 mm. Therefore, there is no change in the length of AD (\\( \\Delta L = 0 \\)).\n\nThus, the average normal strain along AD is:\n\\[ \\text{Average normal strain} = \\frac{0}{400} = 0 \\]\n\nHowever, since the options provided do not include zero, it suggests a potential misinterpretation or error in the problem setup or options given. Based on the provided options, none directly match this calculation."
