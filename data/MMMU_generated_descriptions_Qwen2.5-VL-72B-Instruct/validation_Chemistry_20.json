    "description": "The image depicts a complex organic molecule with the following structural features:\n\n1. **Ring System**: The molecule consists of three fused rings:\n   - A six-membered aromatic ring (benzene-like) on the left.\n   - A five-membered ring containing an oxygen atom (labeled \"O\") in the middle.\n   - Another six-membered ring on the right.\n\n2. **Functional Groups**:\n   - There is a hydroxyl group (-OH) attached to the leftmost benzene ring.\n   - Another hydroxyl group (-OH) is attached to the rightmost six-membered ring.\n   - A methyl group (-CH\u2083) is bonded to a nitrogen atom (N), which is part of a five-membered ring structure that includes the aforementioned oxygen atom.\n\n3. **Chirality Centers**:\n   - The molecule has four stereocenters (chirality centers). These are carbon atoms that are bonded to four different groups:\n     - One carbon in the five-membered ring containing the oxygen atom.\n     - Two carbons in the six-membered ring on the right side.\n     - One carbon in the bridge connecting the five-membered ring and the six-membered ring on the right.\n\n4. **Bonding and Stereochemistry**:\n   - The bonds between the rings and functional groups are depicted with solid and dashed lines, indicating their spatial orientation (solid for bonds coming out of the plane, dashed for bonds going into the plane).\n   - The nitrogen atom is part of a five-membered ring and is bonded to a methyl group, but it is not a chirality center since it is not a carbon atom.\n\nIn summary, the molecule has four chirality centers, which are the carbon atoms bonded to four different groups within the ring system."
