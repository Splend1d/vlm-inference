    "description": "The image presents a table with data collected from five different bays (labeled Bay 1 through Bay 5). The table includes four columns:\n\n1. **Bay**: Lists the bay numbers (1 to 5).\n2. **Observed length (m)**: Indicates the observed lengths in meters for each bay:\n   - Bay 1: 30.034 m\n   - Bay 2: 30.109 m\n   - Bay 3: 30.198 m\n   - Bay 4: 30.075 m\n   - Bay 5: 30.121 m\n\n3. **Mean temperature (\u00b0C)**: Shows the average temperatures recorded for each bay:\n   - Bay 1: 25.2\u00b0C\n   - Bay 2: 25.4\u00b0C\n   - Bay 3: 25.1\u00b0C\n   - Bay 4: 25.0\u00b0C\n   - Bay 5: 24.8\u00b0C\n\n4. **Reduced levels of index marks (m)**: Provides two sets of reduced level values for each bay:\n   - Bay 1: 293.235 m and 293.610 m\n   - Bay 2: 293.610 m and 294.030 m\n   - Bay 3: 294.030 m and 294.498 m\n   - Bay 4: 294.498 m and 294.000 m\n   - Bay 5: 294.000 m and 293.355 m\n\nThis table provides essential information about the observed lengths, temperatures, and reduced levels necessary for calculating corrections due to temperature, tension, and other factors affecting the measurement of a baseline using a tape measure."
