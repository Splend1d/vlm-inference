    "description": "The image shows a close-up view of a person's skin, specifically focusing on the chest area. The skin appears light in color with a significant amount of dark, coarse hair covering the region. There are several small, brownish, slightly raised lesions scattered across the skin. These lesions vary slightly in size but generally appear flat or slightly elevated with irregular borders. They seem to be distributed randomly over the chest area and do not appear to be inflamed or irritated. The texture of the lesions suggests they might be rough or scaly to the touch. There is no visible sign of recent growth or change in the appearance of these lesions. Additionally, there is a watermark at the bottom of the image that reads \"Clinical Dermatology Handbook.\""
