    "description": "The image depicts an electrical circuit consisting of a voltage source \\( v_g(t) \\), a resistor with resistance \\( 2\\Omega \\), and an inductor with inductance \\( 1H \\). The voltage source \\( v_g(t) \\) is connected to the positive terminal of the resistor, which is then connected to the positive terminal of the inductor. The negative terminal of the inductor is connected back to the negative terminal of the voltage source, forming a closed loop. The current flowing through the circuit is denoted as \\( i(t) \\), and the voltage across the resistor is denoted as \\( v(t) \\).\n\nThe voltage source \\( v_g(t) \\) is given by \\( v_g(t) = 3t u(t) \\), where \\( u(t) \\) is the unit step function. This means that the voltage source is zero for \\( t < 0 \\) and increases linearly with time for \\( t \\geq 0 \\).\n\nTo find the current \\( i(t) \\), we need to solve the differential equation that describes the behavior of the circuit. The voltage across the resistor is given by \\( v(t) = 2i(t) \\), and the voltage across the inductor is given by \\( L \\frac{di(t)}{dt} = 1 \\frac{di(t)}{dt} \\). According to Kirchhoff's voltage law, the sum of the voltages around the loop is zero:\n\n\\[ v_g(t) = v(t) + L \\frac{di(t)}{dt} \\]\n\nSubstituting the expressions for \\( v(t) \\) and \\( L \\):\n\n\\[ 3t u(t) = 2i(t) + \\frac{di(t)}{dt} \\]\n\nThis is a first-order linear differential equation. To solve it, we use the method of integrating factors. The homogeneous solution to the differential equation \\( \\frac{di(t)}{dt} + 2i(t) = 0 \\) is:\n\n\\[ i_h(t) = C e^{-2t} \\]\n\nFor the particular solution, we assume a form \\( i_p(t) = At \\). Substituting \\( i_p(t) = At \\) into the differential equation:\n\n\\[ 3t = 2At + A \\]\n\nEquating coefficients, we get \\( A = 3 \\). Therefore, the particular solution is \\( i_p(t) = 3t \\). The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous and particular solutions:\n\n\\[ i(t) = C e^{-2t} + 3t \\]\n\nUsing the initial condition \\( i(0) = 0 \\):\n\n\\[ 0 = C e^{0} + 3 \\cdot 0 \\]\n\\[ C = 0 \\]\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\n\\[ i(t) = 3t - 3 e^{-2t} \\]\n\nHowever, since the voltage source is zero for \\( t < 0 \\), the current is also zero for \\( t < 0 \\). Therefore, the current is:\n\n\\[ i(t) = 3 e^{-2t} u(t) \\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n\\boxed{B}"
