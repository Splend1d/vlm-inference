    "question": "A rod on a horizontal tabletop is pivoted at one end and is free to rotate without friction about a vertical axis, as shown. A force F is applied at the other end, at an angle $\\theta $ to the rod. If F were to be applied perpendicular to the rod, at what distance from the axis should it be applied in order to produce the same torque?<image 1>",

    "description": "The image shows a top-down view of a rod of length \\( L \\) lying horizontally on a surface. The rod is pivoted at one end, which is labeled as the \"Axis,\" indicating that this end is fixed and the rod can rotate around this point. At the other end of the rod, a force \\( F \\) is applied at an angle \\( \\theta \\) relative to the rod. The direction of the force is indicated by an arrow pointing diagonally upward and to the right, forming the angle \\( \\theta \\) with the rod.\n\nThe question asks how the application of the force \\( F \\) would change if it were applied perpendicularly to the rod while maintaining the same torque. The torque (\\( \\tau \\)) produced by a force is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ \\tau = r \\cdot F \\cdot \\sin(\\phi) \\]\n\nwhere \\( r \\) is the distance from the pivot point (axis) to the point where the force is applied, \\( F \\) is the magnitude of the force, and \\( \\phi \\) is the angle between the force vector and the line connecting the pivot point to the point of application of the force.\n\nIn the current setup, the distance \\( r \\) is \\( L \\), the full length of the rod, and the angle \\( \\phi \\) is \\( \\theta \\). Therefore, the torque is:\n\n\\[ \\tau = L \\cdot F \\cdot \\sin(\\theta) \\]\n\nIf the force \\( F \\) is applied perpendicularly to the rod, the angle \\( \\phi \\) becomes \\( 90^\\circ \\), and \\( \\sin(90^\\circ) = 1 \\). To achieve the same torque, we need to find the new distance \\( r' \\) such that:\n\n\\[ \\tau = r' \\cdot F \\cdot \\sin(90^\\circ) = r' \\cdot F \\cdot 1 = r' \\cdot F \\]\n\nSetting the two expressions for torque equal gives:\n\n\\[ L \\cdot F \\cdot \\sin(\\theta) = r' \\cdot F \\]\n\nSolving for \\( r' \\):\n\n\\[ r' = L \\cdot \\sin(\\theta) \\]\n\nTherefore, the distance from the axis at which the force \\( F \\) should be applied perpendicularly to produce the same torque is \\( L \\sin(\\theta) \\).\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{A}\n\\]"
