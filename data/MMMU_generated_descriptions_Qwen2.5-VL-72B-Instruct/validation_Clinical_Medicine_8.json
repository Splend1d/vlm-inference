    "question": "A 23-year-old G2 P1 woman has noted minimal fetal movement in the second trimester. An ultrasound scan at 19 weeks shows hydrops fetalis. A girl infant is born at 32 weeks gestation and is markedly icteric. The microscopic appearance of the placenta is shown here. Laboratory studies show the baby has a Hct of 18%, and an exchange transfusion is performed. Her first pregnancy was uncomplicated and resulted in the birth of a normal girl at term. Which of the following immunologic mechanisms is most likely to produce these findings? <image 1> ",
    "options": "['Anti-receptor antibody', 'Immune complex formation', 'Complement mediated cell destruction', 'Delayed type hypersensitivity', 'Loss of self tolerance']",

    "description": "The image provided is a histological section of a placenta stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). The staining highlights various cellular structures and components within the tissue. The overall appearance of the placental tissue shows significant pathological changes. \n\nThe tissue exhibits areas of congestion and edema, which are indicative of increased fluid accumulation within the placental villi. There is also evidence of inflammation, as seen by the presence of numerous inflammatory cells infiltrating the placental tissue. These inflammatory cells appear to be predominantly lymphocytes and plasma cells, suggesting an immune response.\n\nAdditionally, there are areas of necrosis and hemorrhage visible within the placental villi. The necrotic areas are characterized by the loss of cellular structure and the presence of debris. The hemorrhagic areas are indicated by the presence of red blood cells and hemosiderin deposits, which are remnants of degraded red blood cells.\n\nThe placental villi themselves appear to be enlarged and distorted, with thickened walls and reduced intervillous space. This suggests impaired blood flow and gas exchange between the maternal and fetal circulations. The overall appearance of the placenta is consistent with a condition known as chronic villitis, which is often associated with maternal-fetal immune reactions.\n\nGiven the clinical history of hydrops fetalis, marked jaundice, and low hematocrit in the newborn, along with the histological findings of inflammation, necrosis, and hemorrhage in the placenta, the most likely immunologic mechanism responsible for these findings is complement-mediated cell destruction. This mechanism involves the activation of the complement system, leading to the lysis of red blood cells and other cellular components, resulting in the observed clinical and pathological features. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is C. Complement-mediated cell destruction."
