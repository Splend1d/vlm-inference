    "description": "The image depicts a pedigree chart used to illustrate genetic relationships among family members. Here's a detailed breakdown:\n\n- The chart consists of squares (representing males) and circles (representing females).\n- There are two main branches stemming from a central square at the top left corner.\n- The central square connects to a circle labeled \"A\" via a horizontal line, indicating they are parents.\n- Below this couple, there is one offspring represented by a circle labeled \"B,\" connected to both parents by vertical lines.\n- Additionally, there is another square connected to the central square, but it does not have any offspring with the central square.\n- Another circle is connected to the square labeled \"A,\" forming a separate branch that does not connect to \"B.\"\n\nBased on this pedigree:\n- Individual \"A\" is a parent of individual \"B.\"\n- The coefficient of relatedness between a parent and an offspring is always 1/2 because an offspring inherits half of its genes from each parent.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of relatedness between individuals A and B is 1/2."
