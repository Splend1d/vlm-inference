Here's a detailed breakdown:\n\n- **Screening Test Results for Cervical Cancer Patients**:\n  - Positive test result: 800 patients.\n  - Negative test result: 200 patients.\n  - Total number of cervical cancer patients: 1000.\n\n- **Screening Test Results for Non-Cervical Cancer Patients**:\n  - Positive test result: 200 patients.\n  - Negative test result: 800 patients.\n  - Total number of non-cervical cancer patients: 1000.\n\nSensitivity is defined as the proportion of true positives (patients with cervical cancer who tested positive) out of all actual positives (all patients with cervical cancer). \n\nTo calculate sensitivity:\n\\[ \\text{Sensitivity} = \\frac{\\text{Number of true positives}}{\\text{Total number of actual positives}} \\times 100\\% \\]\n\nFrom the data:\n- Number of true positives (cervical cancer patients who tested positive): 800.\n- Total number of actual positives (total cervical cancer patients): 1000.\n\nTherefore:\n\\[ \\text{Sensitivity} = \\frac{800}{1000} \\times 100\\% = 80\\% \\]"
