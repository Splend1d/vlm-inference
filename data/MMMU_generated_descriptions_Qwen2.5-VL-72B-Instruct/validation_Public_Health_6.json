    "description": "The image displays a contingency table comparing the occurrence of infections among patients at two different hospitals, Hospital A and Hospital B, during the same time period. The table is organized into three columns: \"Infection,\" \"No Infection,\" and \"Total.\" There are also two rows for each hospital, plus a row for totals.\n\nHere are the specific numbers:\n\n- **Hospital A**:\n  - Infection: 16 patients developed an infection.\n  - No Infection: 237 patients did not develop an infection.\n  - Total: 253 patients were observed in Hospital A.\n\n- **Hospital B**:\n  - Infection: 27 patients developed an infection.\n  - No Infection: 594 patients did not develop an infection.\n  - Total: 621 patients were observed in Hospital B.\n\nThe table provides a clear comparison of infection rates between the two hospitals, with Hospital B having a higher total number of patients and a slightly higher number of infections compared to Hospital A. The data is presented in a format suitable for conducting statistical tests to compare proportions between the two groups."
