    "question": "In the following figure, select the correct view ().<image 1>",
    "options": "['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']",
    "id": "validation_Mechanical_Engineering_2",
    "description": "The image shows a technical drawing with four options labeled A, B, C, and D. Each option represents a cross-sectional view of an object that appears to be a bent pipe or tube. The main part of the image shows a side view of this object, which has a straight section followed by a bend.\n\n- **Option A**: Shows a cross-section where the circular outline of the pipe is visible, but the bend is not depicted correctly. The lines indicating the bend do not align properly with the circular outline.\n  \n- **Option B**: Displays a cross-section where the circular outline of the pipe is shown, and the lines indicating the bend are correctly aligned with the circular outline, suggesting a proper representation of the bend in the pipe.\n  \n- **Option C**: Depicts a cross-section similar to Option A, where the circular outline is visible, but the lines indicating the bend are not aligned correctly with the circular outline.\n  \n- **Option D**: Shows a cross-section where the circular outline of the pipe is visible, but it lacks any indication of the bend, making it an incomplete representation of the object.\n\nBased on the descriptions provided for each option, the correct view should accurately represent both the circular outline of the pipe and the bend. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. B**"
