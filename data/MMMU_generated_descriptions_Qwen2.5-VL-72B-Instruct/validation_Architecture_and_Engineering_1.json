    "description": "The image depicts a truss structure labeled P12.37. The truss spans a total horizontal distance of 90 feet, divided into six equal segments of 15 feet each. The truss has two parallel chords: an upper chord (BCDE) and a lower chord (AGF). The vertical height between the upper and lower chords is 20 feet.\n\nKey points along the truss include:\n- **A** and **F**: These are the supports at either end of the truss. Support A is a pin support, allowing rotation but no horizontal or vertical movement. Support F is a roller support, allowing horizontal movement but preventing vertical movement.\n- **B, C, D, E**: These are joints along the upper chord.\n- **G**: This is a joint along the lower chord directly below joint C.\n  \nThe truss includes diagonal members connecting the upper and lower chords. Specifically:\n- Diagonal members connect B to A, C to A, D to G, E to F, and D to F.\n- There are also vertical members connecting B to G and C to G.\n\nBar **CG** is a vertical member connecting joint C on the upper chord to joint G on the lower chord.\n\nThe problem involves designing the truss for a uniform live load of 0.32 kip/ft distributed across the entire span and a concentrated live load of 24 kips that can be placed at any point to maximize the force in bar CG. The goal is to determine the maximum live load force (tension, compression, or both) created in bar CG under these loading conditions. \n\nOptions provided for the maximum value of live load force in bar CG are:\nA. 9.75 kips compression\nB. 5.75 kips compression\nC. 7.75 kips compression"
