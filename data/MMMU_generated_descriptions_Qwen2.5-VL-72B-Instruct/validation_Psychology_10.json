    "description": "The image is a side view illustration of the human brain within the skull. The brain is divided into four distinct lobes, each labeled with a number:\n\n- **Lobe 1** is located at the front of the brain and is colored in a light greenish-yellow shade. This lobe occupies the anterior portion of the cerebral cortex.\n  \n- **Lobe 2** is situated behind Lobe 1 and is colored purple. It covers a significant portion of the upper middle area of the brain.\n  \n- **Lobe 3** is positioned further back and is colored blue. It is located towards the rear of the brain, near the back of the skull.\n  \n- **Lobe 4** is found below Lobe 2 and is colored orange. It is located in the lower middle part of the brain, closer to the base.\n\nThese lobes correspond to the major anatomical divisions of the cerebral cortex. Based on their positions and colors, they represent different functional regions of the brain."
