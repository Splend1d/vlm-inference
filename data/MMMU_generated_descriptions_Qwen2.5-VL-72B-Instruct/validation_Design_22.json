    "description": "The image depicts a modern dining room with a central round table surrounded by four chairs. The table is positioned in the middle of the room, and the chairs are evenly spaced around it, creating a symmetrical arrangement. Above the table hangs a single pendant light with a cylindrical shade, further emphasizing the central focus of the room. The background features a wooden panel wall with a warm tone, adding texture and warmth to the space. To the left, there is a tall vase with a plant, and to the right, there is a sideboard with a framed picture above it. The overall layout of the room exhibits a sense of order and balance, with all elements arranged harmoniously around the central table. The radial balance is evident as the chairs, light fixture, and even the placement of the sideboard and vase seem to radiate outward from the central point of the table, creating a circular symmetry. \n\nBased on this description, the correct answer to the question is:\n\nC. Radical"
