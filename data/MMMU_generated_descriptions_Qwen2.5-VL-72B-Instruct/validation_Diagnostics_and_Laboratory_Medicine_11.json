    "description": "The image shows a histological section of brain tissue stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). The tissue exhibits numerous vacuoles scattered throughout the neuropil, which appear as clear, round spaces within the tissue matrix. These vacuoles vary in size and are distributed diffusely across the field of view. There are also some cells with darkly stained nuclei, likely representing neurons or glial cells, interspersed among the vacuoles. The overall appearance suggests spongiform change, characterized by the presence of these vacuoles within the brain parenchyma. This type of change is typically associated with prion diseases. \n\nBased on this description, the most likely diagnosis is:\n\nB. Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease"
