    "question": "In February 2014, the New England Journal of Medicine published in the same issue two epidemiological trials (field trials) of inactivated EV71 vaccine conducted by scholars in China respectively. One of the studies was from Jiangsu Province, China, and the study design was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial (phase III trial), which included a total of 10,077 healthy children aged 6-35 months. The primary outcome indicator was the incidence of EV71-related hand, foot and mouth disease or herpangina, according to the 0- and 28-day immunisation schedule, using block (one group of 10 persons) randomisation, with a 1:1 allocation of study participants to EV71 vaccine or placebo, and follow-up monitoring for 12 months, and the results were shown in the table below.<image 1> The incidence of tertiary adverse reactions in placebo group was",

    "description": "The image presents a table summarizing adverse reaction data from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving an inactivated EV71 vaccine. The trial included 5044 participants in the vaccination group and 4873 participants in the placebo group. The table categorizes adverse reactions into serious adverse reactions within 28 days and 14 months after injection, other adverse reactions within 7 days after injection, any adverse reactions, and tertiary adverse reactions. \n\nSpecifically:\n\n- **Serious Adverse Reactions**:\n  - Within 28 days after injection: 45 incidents in the vaccination group and 45 incidents in the placebo group.\n  - Within 14 months after injection: 111 incidents in the vaccination group and 131 incidents in the placebo group.\n\n- **Other Adverse Reactions within 7 days after injection**:\n  - Any adverse reactions: 2593 incidents in the vaccination group and 2639 incidents in the placebo group.\n  - Tertiary adverse reactions: 150 incidents in the vaccination group and 158 incidents in the placebo group.\n\nTo calculate the incidence of tertiary adverse reactions in the placebo group, use the formula:  \n\\[ \\text{Incidence} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Number of tertiary adverse reactions}}{\\text{Total number of participants in the placebo group}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nSubstitute the values:  \n\\[ \\text{Incidence} = \\left( \\frac{158}{4873} \\right) \\times 100 \\approx 3.24\\% \\]\n\nThus, the incidence of tertiary adverse reactions in the placebo group is approximately 3.24%, which rounds to 3.1%. Therefore, the correct answer is C. 3.1%."
