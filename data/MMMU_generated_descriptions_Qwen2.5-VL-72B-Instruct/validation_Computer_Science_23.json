    "question": "Suppose that TCP's current estimated values for the round trip time (estimatedRTT) and deviation in the RTT (DevRTT) are 250 msec and 38 msec, respectively (see Section 3.5.3 for a discussion of these variables). Suppose that the next three measured values of the RTT are 280 msec, 200 msec, and 340 msec respectively. <image 1> Compute TCP's new value of DevRTT, estimatedRTT, and the TCP timeout value after each of these three measured RTT values is obtained. Use the values of $\\alpha$ = 0.125, and $\\beta$ = 0.25. Round your answers to two decimal places after leading zeros. What is the estimatedRTT after the first RTT?",

    "description": "The image illustrates a simplified model of network communication between two computers connected via the Internet. Each computer has a stack of protocol layers: application, TCP, IP, link, and physical. The application layer at both ends communicates over the TCP layer, which in turn relies on the IP layer for routing packets across the network. The link layer handles data transmission over the physical medium, represented by the \"physical\" layer.\n\nA red arrow labeled \"RTT\" spans between the TCP layers of the two computers, indicating the concept of Round Trip Time\u2014the time it takes for a packet to travel from one computer to the other and back. This visual representation emphasizes that RTT is a key metric in TCP for managing network performance and reliability.\n\nThe Internet is depicted as a cloud between the two computers, symbolizing the complex network infrastructure that connects them. The image does not provide specific numerical values or formulas related to RTT calculation but visually represents the context in which RTT is relevant for TCP operations. \n\nTo answer the question about the estimatedRTT after the first RTT measurement, you would use the provided initial values and the formula for updating the estimatedRTT with the measured RTT value. The image itself does not contain the necessary numerical data or formulas for this calculation."
