    "description": "The image depicts an electrical circuit with various current paths and measurements. Here's a detailed description:\n\n- There is a current source on the left side of the circuit providing -2A.\n- This current splits into two branches at a junction. One branch leads to a resistor where the current is measured as 1A flowing through it.\n- The other branch leads to another junction where the current splits again. At this junction, one path leads to a resistor where the current is measured as 0.5A.\n- The remaining current from this second junction flows into a third branch, which is labeled as \\( I_1 \\).\n- Further along in the circuit, there is another junction where the currents combine. At this point, the combined current is measured as 1.5A.\n- Finally, the current exits the circuit through a path labeled as \\( I_2 \\).\n\nFrom the given information:\n- The total current entering the first junction is -2A.\n- Since 1A flows through the first resistor, the remaining current (-2A + 1A = -1A) flows into the second branch.\n- In the second branch, 0.5A flows through the resistor, so the remaining current (-1A + 0.5A = -0.5A) flows into the path labeled \\( I_1 \\). However, since the direction of \\( I_1 \\) is opposite to the assumed direction, \\( I_1 \\) is actually 0.5A in the opposite direction.\n- At the final junction, the currents combine to give 1.5A. Since 0.5A comes from \\( I_1 \\), the remaining current (1.5A - 0.5A = 1A) must flow through \\( I_2 \\).\n\nTherefore, the currents \\( I_1 \\) and \\( I_2 \\) are 0.5A and 1A, respectively. However, none of the provided options match exactly. The closest option considering possible rounding or interpretation differences would be:\n\n**C. 2.5A and 0A** (if there was a misinterpretation or error in the provided options). \n\nBut based on the exact values calculated:  \n\\( I_1 = 0.5A \\) and \\( I_2 = 1A \\)."
