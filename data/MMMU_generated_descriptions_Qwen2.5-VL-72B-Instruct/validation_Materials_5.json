    "question": "The chandelier is suspended from the wall and ceiling using rods AB and BC, which have diameters of 3 mm and 4 mm, respectively. If the average normal stress in both rods is not allowed to exceed 150 MPa, determine the largest mass of the chandelier that can be supported if u = 45. <image 1>",

    "description": "The image depicts a chandelier suspended by two rods, AB and BC, connected at points A, B, and C. Point A is fixed to the wall, point B is where the chandelier is attached, and point C is fixed to the ceiling. The rod AB forms an angle of 30\u00b0 with the horizontal, while the angle \u03b8 between rod BC and the vertical is given as 45\u00b0 (u = 45\u00b0). \n\nRod AB has a diameter of 3 mm, and rod BC has a diameter of 4 mm. Both rods are subjected to tension due to the weight of the chandelier. The maximum allowable average normal stress in both rods is specified as 150 MPa. The goal is to determine the largest mass of the chandelier that can be supported under these conditions.\n\nThe structure includes a wooden beam at the top, which serves as part of the ceiling support system. The chandelier itself is ornate, featuring multiple light fixtures. The rods AB and BC are depicted as straight lines connecting their respective points, forming a triangular support structure for the chandelier. The angles and dimensions provided are crucial for calculating the forces acting on the rods and, subsequently, the maximum mass of the chandelier that can be safely supported."
