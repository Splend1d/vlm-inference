    "description": "The image depicts a mechanical device known as a metal stud punch, which consists of several components connected by pins and links. The key elements and dimensions are as follows:\n\n- **Handle**: A force of 120 N is applied vertically downward at the end of the handle.\n- **Dimensions**:\n  - The handle extends 300 mm horizontally from point D to the point where the force is applied.\n  - From point D to point E, there is a vertical distance of 50 mm and a horizontal distance of 100 mm.\n  - Point E is connected to point B via a link that is 50 mm long.\n  - Point B is connected to point C via another link that forms a 60-degree angle with the horizontal.\n  - The distance from point C to the base is 200 mm.\n  - There is a 30-degree angle between the link BE and the horizontal line extending from point E.\n- **Pins and Joints**:\n  - Pin A is located at the intersection of the links connecting points B and E.\n  - Pin C is fixed to the base of the device.\n  - Pin D is where the handle connects to the rest of the mechanism.\n\nThe goal is to determine the magnitude of the reactive force at pin A due to the 120 N force applied at the handle. The geometry and angles provided are crucial for calculating the forces using principles of statics and mechanics."
