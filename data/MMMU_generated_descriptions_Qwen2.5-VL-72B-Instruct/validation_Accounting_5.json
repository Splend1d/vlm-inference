    "question": "The following data show the units in beginning work in process inventory, the number of units started, the number of units transferred, and the percent completion of the ending work in process for conversion. Given that materials are added at the beginning of the process, what are the equivalent units for conversion costs for each quarter using the weighted-average method? Assume that the quarters are independent.<image 1>",

    "description": "The image presents a table with four columns and five rows, including the header row. The columns represent different pieces of information related to production processes across four quarters. Here's a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Columns:\n1. **Quarter**: Lists the four quarters (1, 2, 3, and 4).\n2. **Beginning Work in Process**: Indicates the number of units in the beginning work-in-process inventory for each quarter.\n   - Quarter 1: \u2014 (no value provided, implying zero)\n   - Quarter 2: 2,500 units\n   - Quarter 3: 3,600 units\n   - Quarter 4: 6,500 units\n3. **Started**: Shows the number of units started in each quarter.\n   - Quarter 1: 255,000 units\n   - Quarter 2: 275,000 units\n   - Quarter 3: 290,000 units\n   - Quarter 4: 300,000 units\n4. **Transferred Out**: Represents the number of units transferred out during each quarter.\n   - Quarter 1: 235,000 units\n   - Quarter 2: 250,000 units\n   - Quarter 3: 275,000 units\n   - Quarter 4: 280,000 units\n5. **Conversion (%)**: Displays the percentage completion of the ending work-in-process inventory for conversion costs.\n   - Quarter 1: 50%\n   - Quarter 2: 40%\n   - Quarter 3: 45%\n   - Quarter 4: 60%\n\n### Additional Information:\n- Materials are added at the beginning of the process.\n- The question asks for the equivalent units for conversion costs for each quarter using the weighted-average method.\n- The quarters are considered independent of one another.\n\nThis detailed description should enable someone to calculate the equivalent units for conversion costs for each quarter without needing to see the image."
