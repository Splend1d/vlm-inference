    "description": "The image shows a highly branched neuron against a yellowish background. The neuron has a central cell body from which numerous dendrites extend outward in a complex, tree-like pattern. These dendrites branch out extensively, creating a dense network of fine extensions. The overall structure resembles a bush or a coral, with the dendrites spreading out in multiple directions but generally maintaining a relatively flat plane. There are no visible granule cell axons in the image, but based on the typical organization of the cerebellum, where Purkinje cells are located, the dendrites of the Purkinje cell are known to be oriented perpendicular to the parallel fibers (axons of granule cells). Therefore, the orientation of the Purkinje cell dendrites with respect to the granule cell axons is perpendicular."
