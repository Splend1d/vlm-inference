    "question": "Suppose that the price of basketball tickets at your college is determined by market forces. Currently, the demand and supply schedules are as follows: <image 1> Your college plans to increase total enrollment next year by 5,000 students. The additional students will have the following demand schedule: <image 2> Now add the old demand schedule and the demand schedule for the new students to calculate the new demand schedule for the entire college. What will be the new equilibrium price?",

For each price level, sum the quantities demanded from both groups of students. Then compare this new combined demand schedule with the supply schedule to find where quantity demanded equals quantity supplied. This intersection point will give you the new equilibrium price."
