    "description": "The image displays a table labeled \"Table 10.15,\" which compares the number of annual goals scored by teams in the Western and Eastern Major League Soccer (MLS) conferences. The table is divided into two columns: \"Western\" and \"Eastern.\" Each row lists a team from each conference along with the number of goals they scored. Here is the data presented:\n\n**Western Conference:**\n- Los Angeles: 9 goals\n- FC Dallas: 3 goals\n- Chivas USA: 4 goals\n- Real Salt Lake: 3 goals\n- Colorado: 4 goals\n- San Jose: 4 goals\n\n**Eastern Conference:**\n- D.C. United: 9 goals\n- Chicago: 8 goals\n- Columbus: 7 goals\n- New England: 6 goals\n- MetroStars: 5 goals\n- Kansas City: 3 goals\n\nThis table provides the goal-scoring data necessary for conducting a hypothesis test comparing the performance of the two conferences. The data appears to be paired, with each Western team matched against an Eastern team. The sample size is small (n=6 pairs), and the data does not suggest any specific distribution type like uniform or exponential. The question asks about the exact distribution for the hypothesis test, which would typically involve comparing means between the two groups. Given the small sample size and paired nature of the data, the most appropriate distribution for this scenario is likely the **Student's t-distribution**."
