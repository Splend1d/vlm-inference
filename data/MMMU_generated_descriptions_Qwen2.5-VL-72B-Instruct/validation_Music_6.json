    "question": "<image 1> The second measure of the above example uses which rhythmic device?",
    "options": "['Anacrusis', 'Hemiola', 'Suspension', 'Augmentation']",

    "description": "The image displays a musical excerpt written for piano, with both treble and bass clefs. The time signature is 6/8, indicating compound duple meter. \n\nIn the **first measure**, the treble clef features a series of eighth notes: D, E-flat, F, G, A-flat, B-flat, C, and D. The bass clef has a similar pattern but starts with an E-flat, followed by F, G, A-flat, B-flat, C, and D.\n\nIn the **second measure**, the treble clef continues with a sequence of eighth notes: A-flat, B-flat, C, D, E-flat, F, G, and A-flat. The bass clef begins with a G, then an A-flat tied to another A-flat, followed by B-flat and C.\n\nThe key detail in the second measure is the **tied note** (A-flat tied to A-flat) in the bass clef. This creates a rhythmic effect where the duration of the tied note spans across the beat structure, disrupting the typical 6/8 feel. This disruption suggests a rhythmic device where the natural grouping of beats is altered.\n\nGiven this description, the rhythmic device used in the second measure is **Hemiola** (Option B). Hemiola involves a temporary shift in the perceived meter, often achieved by grouping beats differently than expected, which aligns with the tied note creating a cross-rhythmic effect in this measure."
