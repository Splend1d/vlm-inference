    "description": "The image displays two coronal sections of human brains placed side by side against a blue background. The brain on the left is labeled \"normal,\" indicating it represents a healthy brain. This brain has well-defined gyri and sulci, with no apparent abnormalities in the structure or size of the cerebral cortex. The ventricles appear proportionate and within normal limits for a healthy brain.\n\nIn contrast, the brain on the right exhibits noticeable differences. The most striking feature is the significant enlargement of the lateral ventricles, which are the dark spaces within the brain tissue. This ventricular dilation suggests atrophy of the surrounding brain tissue. Additionally, there is a visible reduction in the volume of the caudate nucleus, a part of the basal ganglia located near the lateral ventricles. The caudate appears shrunken and less prominent compared to its counterpart in the normal brain.\n\nGiven these observations, the brain on the right shows signs of caudate atrophy, which is characteristic of Huntington's Disease. There is no evidence of cortical atrophy typical of Alzheimer's Disease, nor does it show normal variation in ventricular size. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is:\n\nB. caudate atrophy consistent with Huntington's Disease."
