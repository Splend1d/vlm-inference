    "question": "<image 1> In the figure above, where does the neurotransmitter dopamine have its effect?",
    "options": "['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E']",
    "id": "validation_Psychology_13",
    "description": "The image depicts a synapse between two neurons: a presynaptic neuron and a postsynaptic neuron. The presynaptic neuron is shown at the top, and the postsynaptic neuron is at the bottom. \n\n- **A** points to the synaptic terminal of the presynaptic neuron.\n- **B** indicates vesicles within the presynaptic neuron that contain neurotransmitters.\n- **C** shows neurotransmitter molecules that have been released into the synaptic cleft.\n- **D** represents the synaptic cleft, which is the space between the presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons.\n- **E** points to receptors on the membrane of the postsynaptic neuron.\n\nNeurotransmitters like dopamine are released from the presynaptic neuron into the synaptic cleft (D) and then bind to specific receptors (E) on the postsynaptic neuron. Therefore, the effect of dopamine occurs at the receptors on the postsynaptic neuron."
