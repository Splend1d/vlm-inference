    "description": "The first image depicts the interior of a grand, historic building characterized by its vast, open space and intricate architectural design. The most striking feature is the large central dome, which dominates the ceiling and is supported by a series of arches and pendentives. The dome is adorned with a patterned design that appears to be composed of small, colorful pieces, suggesting the use of mosaics. The walls are lined with rows of windows that allow natural light to flood the space, enhancing the luminosity of the interior. The overall aesthetic is one of opulence and grandeur, typical of significant religious or cultural structures from historical periods known for their elaborate artistry.\n\nThe second image is a floor plan of the same building, showing the layout with labeled sections such as the nave, aisles, apse, and narthex. This technical drawing provides a clear understanding of the spatial organization but does not offer direct visual information about the materials used in the interior decoration.\n\nBased on the description of the first image, the interior surfaces of the upper walls and dome of the building were originally covered with **C. mosaics**. The patterned design visible on the dome suggests the use of small, colorful pieces characteristic of mosaic art."
