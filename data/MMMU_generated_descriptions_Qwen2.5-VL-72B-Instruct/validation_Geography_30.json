    "description": "The image provided is a graph depicting a low-strain reflected wave dynamic test curve for a column. The x-axis represents time (t) in milliseconds (ms), while the y-axis represents velocity (v) in meters per second (m/s). The curve shows three distinct peaks labeled as \\( t_1 \\), \\( t_2 \\), and \\( t_3 \\).\n\n- \\( t_1 \\): This is the first peak on the left side of the graph. It occurs very early in the time scale, indicating an initial impact or excitation.\n- \\( t_2 \\): This is the second peak, located roughly in the middle of the graph. It appears as a sharp negative spike, suggesting a reflection from a boundary within the pile.\n- \\( t_3 \\): This is the third peak, located towards the right side of the graph. It is similar in shape to \\( t_1 \\), indicating another reflection, likely from the bottom of the pile.\n\nThe time intervals between these peaks are crucial for calculating the length of the pile. Specifically, the time difference between \\( t_1 \\) and \\( t_3 \\) is relevant because it corresponds to the round-trip travel time of the wave from the top of the pile to the bottom and back.\n\nGiven the average wave velocity of the pile body as 3555.6 m/s, the length of the pile can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Length} = \\frac{\\text{Wave Velocity} \\times \\text{Time Difference}}{2} \\]\n\nTo find the correct option, you would need to estimate the time difference between \\( t_1 \\) and \\( t_3 \\) from the graph and then apply the formula. Based on the provided options, the closest value to the calculated length should be selected."
