    "description": "The image presents a simplified balance sheet for a bank named TD. The balance sheet is divided into two main sections: Assets and Liabilities.\n\n**Assets Section:**\n- Reserves: $493\n- Loans: $2407\n\n**Liabilities Section:**\n- Deposits: $2900\n\nThis balance sheet indicates that TD has assets totaling $2900 ($493 in reserves + $2407 in loans), which matches its liabilities of $2900 (all in deposits). This suggests that the bank is operating with a balance where its assets equal its liabilities.\n\nThe question mentions that TD keeps only the required reserves and that someone deposited an additional $700. To determine the total change in the M1 Money Supply, one would need to calculate the reserve ratio and then use it to find out how much of the new deposit can be loaned out, thereby increasing the money supply. However, the specific steps for this calculation are not included in the description but can be inferred from standard banking principles and the given data."
