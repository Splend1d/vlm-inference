The clipping is under the section labeled \"Classified Ads\" and advertises for research participants. The text reads:\n\n---\n\n**RESEARCH PARTICIPANTS WANTED:**\n\nCollege students needed for a psychological study on **authority and behavior**. Participants must be available for five 30-minute sessions during the fall semester. Note: this research involves some use of confederates), and your responses to different kinds of **authority** will be assessed. Participants can leave at any time without penalty and all IRB procedures will be followed. For further information & applications come to room 248, Jordan Hall.\n\n---\n\nThe key points relevant to answering the question are:\n- The study focuses on **authority and behavior**.\n- Participants' **responses to different kinds of authority** will be assessed.\n- The study involves the use of confederates (people who pretend to be other participants but are actually part of the research team).\n\nBased on these details, the study appears to examine how participants respond to various forms of authority. Therefore, the most likely independent variable is related to the concept of authority."
