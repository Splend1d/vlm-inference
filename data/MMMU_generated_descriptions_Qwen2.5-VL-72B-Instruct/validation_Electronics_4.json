    "description": "The image depicts a common-emitter amplifier circuit using an NPN silicon transistor. The circuit includes the following components:\n\n- **Power Supply**: A positive voltage source \\( V_{CC} \\) is connected to the top of the circuit.\n- **Collector Resistor (\\( R_C \\))**: A resistor labeled \\( R_C \\) is connected between the collector terminal of the transistor and \\( V_{CC} \\).\n- **Emitter Resistor (\\( R_E \\))**: A resistor labeled \\( R_E \\) is connected between the emitter terminal of the transistor and ground (negative terminal of the power supply).\n- **Base Bias Resistors (\\( R_1 \\) and \\( R_2 \\))**: Two resistors, \\( R_1 \\) and \\( R_2 \\), form a voltage divider network. \\( R_1 \\) is connected between \\( V_{CC} \\) and the base of the transistor, while \\( R_2 \\) is connected between the base of the transistor and ground.\n- **Transistor**: An NPN silicon transistor is at the center of the circuit. Its collector is connected to \\( R_C \\), its emitter is connected to \\( R_E \\), and its base is connected to the voltage divider formed by \\( R_1 \\) and \\( R_2 \\).\n\nThe currents in the circuit are denoted as follows:\n- \\( I_C \\): Collector current flowing through \\( R_C \\).\n- \\( I_E \\): Emitter current flowing through \\( R_E \\).\n- \\( I_B \\): Base current flowing through the base-emitter junction.\n\nThe voltages across various parts of the circuit are labeled as:\n- \\( V_{CE} \\): Voltage between the collector and emitter terminals of the transistor.\n- \\( V_{BE} \\): Voltage between the base and emitter terminals of the transistor.\n\nGiven values for the components are:\n- \\( R_1 = 33 \\, \\text{k}\\Omega \\)\n- \\( R_2 = 10 \\, \\text{k}\\Omega \\)\n- \\( R_C = 2.2 \\, \\text{k}\\Omega \\)\n- \\( R_E = 1 \\, \\text{k}\\Omega \\)\n- \\( V_{CC} = 18 \\, \\text{V} \\)\n\nThe transistor has a current gain (\\( \\beta \\)) of 50.
