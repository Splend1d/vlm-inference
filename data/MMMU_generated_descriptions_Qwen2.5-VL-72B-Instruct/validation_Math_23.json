    "question": "A rocket is shot from the top of a tower at an angle of 45\u00b0 above the horizontal (Fig. 19-1). It hits the ground in 5 seconds at a horizontal distance from the foot of the tower equal to three times the height of the tower. Find the height of the tower.<image 1>",
    "options": "['h = 100 ft', 'h = 80 ft', 'h = 110 ft', 'h = 85 ft']",

    "description": "The image depicts a diagram illustrating the trajectory of a projectile launched from the top of a tower. The tower has a height denoted as \\( h \\). The projectile is launched at an angle of 45 degrees above the horizontal. The projectile's path is shown as a curved line, indicating its parabolic motion. The projectile lands on the ground at a horizontal distance from the base of the tower, which is given as \\( 3h \\). The time taken for the projectile to hit the ground is stated as 5 seconds. The figure is labeled as \"Fig. 19-1\". The problem involves using kinematic equations related to projectile motion to determine the height \\( h \\) of the tower. The options provided for the height \\( h \\) are: A. \\( h = 100 \\) ft, B. \\( h = 80 \\) ft, C. \\( h = 110 \\) ft, D. \\( h = 85 \\) ft."
