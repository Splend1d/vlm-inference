    "description": "The image depicts an undirected weighted graph with six vertices labeled 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', and 'f'. The edges connecting these vertices have associated weights as follows:\n\n- Edge (a, b) has a weight of 1.\n- Edge (a, c) has a weight of 6.\n- Edge (b, c) has a weight of 3.\n- Edge (b, d) has a weight of 4.\n- Edge (b, f) has a weight of 2.\n- Edge (c, d) has a weight of 2.\n- Edge (c, e) has a weight of 4.\n- Edge (d, e) has a weight of 3.\n- Edge (d, f) has a weight of 1.\n- Edge (e, f) has a weight of 5.\n\nThe graph is fully connected, meaning there is a path between any two vertices. The weights on the edges represent the cost or distance between the connected vertices. The goal is to determine which sequence of edges cannot be added to form a minimum spanning tree using Kruskal's algorithm, which involves sorting all the edges in non-decreasing order of their weight and adding the next lightest edge that does not form a cycle."
