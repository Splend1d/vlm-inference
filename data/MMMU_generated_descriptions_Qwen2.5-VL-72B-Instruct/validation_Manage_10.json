    "question": "<image 1>: Elements of Website User Experience, Jesse James Garrett (2002) model. The model identifies five interdependent 'planes' with different levels of abstraction that together define the usability of a website. Which of the following options is not part of the model definition?",
    "options": "['cooperate', 'scope', 'Structure', 'Strategy']",
    "id": "validation_Manage_10",
    "description": "The image is a black-and-white illustration depicting a woman seated at a computer workstation. She appears to be interacting with the computer using a keyboard and mouse. The computer screen displays the word \"SURFACE\" prominently in the center, along with various icons and symbols that suggest a user interface design context.\n\nTo the left of the computer monitor, there are four vertical panels extending outward from the screen. Each panel represents a different aspect of website design and is labeled with a specific term:\n\n1. The first panel is labeled \"STRATEGY.\" Below this label, there is an icon of a light bulb, symbolizing ideas or concepts.\n2. The second panel is labeled \"SCOPE.\" This panel includes some bullet points and lines, possibly indicating lists or outlines.\n3. The third panel is labeled \"STRUCTURE.\" It features a diagram resembling a flowchart or organizational chart, suggesting the arrangement of content.\n4. The fourth panel is labeled \"SKELETON.\" An illustration of a human skeleton is depicted here, likely representing the foundational layout of a website.\n\nThe panels are arranged in a sequence from left to right, leading up to the \"SURFACE\" displayed on the computer screen. The overall composition suggests a hierarchical or sequential relationship between these elements, with \"SURFACE\" being the final, most visible layer of the design process.\n\nBased on the labels provided in the image, the elements of the model include \"Strategy,\" \"Scope,\" \"Structure,\" and \"Skeleton,\" culminating in the \"Surface.\" Therefore, the option that is not part of the model definition is:\n\nA. cooperate"
