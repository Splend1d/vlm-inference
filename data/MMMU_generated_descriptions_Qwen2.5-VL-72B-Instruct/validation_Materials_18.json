    "description": "The image depicts a rectangular rubber block with dimensions 300 mm (length AB) and 400 mm (height AD). The rectangle is oriented in an xy-coordinate system, with point A at the origin (0,0), B at (300,0), D at (0,400), and C at (300,400). The block undergoes a deformation represented by dashed lines, indicating a shear strain. \n\nThe shear strain is given by the equation \\(\\gamma_{xy} = 40 \\times 10^{-6}x + 20 \\times 10^{-6}y\\), where \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are in millimeters. This deformation causes the originally straight edges to become slightly curved or angled, but all lines initially parallel to the y-axis remain vertical after deformation. \n\nThe task is to determine the normal strain along edge BC. Since the deformation is due to shear strain and the lines parallel to the y-axis remain vertical, the normal strain along edge BC can be calculated using the given shear strain equation. Specifically, the normal strain along BC will depend on the value of \\(y\\) at points B and C, which is 400 mm. \n\nBy substituting \\(y = 400\\) into the shear strain equation, we get:\n\\[\n\\gamma_{xy} = 40 \\times 10^{-6} \\times 300 + 20 \\times 10^{-6} \\times 400 = 12 \\times 10^{-3} + 8 \\times 10^{-3} = 20 \\times 10^{-3} = 20 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ mm/mm}\n\\]\n\nHowever, since the question asks for the normal strain along BC and considering the options provided, the correct interpretation should focus on the component affecting the length change along BC, leading to the normal strain being:\n\\[\n\\epsilon_{yy} = 20 \\times 10^{-6} \\times 400 = 8 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ mm/mm}\n\\]\n\nThus, the closest option matching this calculation is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{6.00 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ mm/mm}}\n\\]"
