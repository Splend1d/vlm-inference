    "options": "['Project X would be incorrectly rejected; Project Z would be incorrectly accepted.', 'Project Y would be incorrectly rejected; Project X would be incorrectly accepted.', 'Project Z would be incorrectly rejected; Project X would be incorrectly accepted.', 'No project would be incorrectly rejected; Project Z would be incorrectly accepted.']",

    "description": "The image presents a table with three columns and five rows. The first row serves as the header for each column:\n\n- The first column is labeled \"Project,\" listing four projects: W, X, Y, and Z.\n- The second column is labeled \"Beta,\" providing the beta values for each project:\n  - Project W has a beta of 0.80.\n  - Project X has a beta of 0.95.\n  - Project Y has a beta of 1.15.\n  - Project Z has a beta of 1.45.\n- The third column is labeled \"IRR\" (Internal Rate of Return), showing the IRR percentages for each project:\n  - Project W has an IRR of 9.4%.\n  - Project X has an IRR of 10.9%.\n  - Project Y has an IRR of 13.0%.\n  - Project Z has an IRR of 14.2%.\n\nThis table provides the necessary data to calculate the required rate of return for each project using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) formula: \\( \\text{Required Rate of Return} = R_f + \\beta \\times (R_m - R_f) \\), where \\( R_f \\) is the risk-free rate (T-bill rate), \\( \\beta \\) is the beta value, and \\( R_m \\) is the expected return on the market. The T-bill rate is given as 3.5%, and the expected return on the market is 11%. Using this information, one can determine whether each project should be accepted or rejected based on its IRR compared to its required rate of return."
