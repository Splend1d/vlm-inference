The screen features abstract designs in white and metallic accents, including swirling patterns and a prominent black and white abstract shape resembling a stylized bird or flame. The artwork is characterized by its bold color contrast and dynamic lines, showcasing Gray's modernist style. This piece was created in the early 20th century and gained recognition when it was showcased at the Salon des Artistes D\u00e9corateurs. \n\nJacques Doucet, a prominent French fashion designer and collector, sought out Eileen Gray after seeing her work at the Salon. He became an important patron of her art, commissioning several pieces from her, including this iconic screen. The relationship between Doucet and Gray played a significant role in promoting her career and establishing her reputation within the art world."
