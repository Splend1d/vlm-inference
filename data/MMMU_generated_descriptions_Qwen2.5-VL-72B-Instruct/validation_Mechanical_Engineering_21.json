    "question": "A model rocket is launched from rest with a constant upward acceleration of 3 m /s^2 under the action of a small thruster. The thruster shuts off after 8 seconds, and the rocket continues upward until it reaches its apex. At apex, a small chute opens which ensures that the rocket falls at a constant speed of 0.85 m /s until it impacts the ground. Determine the maximum height h attained by the rocket and the total flight time. Neglect aerodynamic drag during ascent, and assume that the mass of the rocket and the acceleration of gravity are both constant.<image 1>",
    "options": "['h=125.358m,t=27.62s', 'h=105.358m,t=27.62s', 'h=125.358m,t=24.62s']",

    "description": "The image illustrates the motion of a model rocket during its launch and descent. The rocket starts from rest on the ground and accelerates upward with a constant acceleration of 3 m/s\u00b2 due to a thruster. After 8 seconds, the thruster shuts off, and the rocket continues to move upward under the influence of gravity until it reaches its highest point (apex). At this apex, a parachute deploys, causing the rocket to descend at a constant speed of 0.85 m/s until it reaches the ground.\n\nKey details from the image:\n\n- **Initial acceleration phase**: The rocket accelerates upward at 3 m/s\u00b2 for 8 seconds.\n- **Free-fall phase**: After the thruster shuts off, the rocket continues to move upward under gravity until it reaches its apex.\n- **Descent phase**: The rocket descends at a constant speed of 0.85 m/s due to the deployed parachute.\n\nThe image also includes a vertical line representing the total height \\( h \\) reached by the rocket. The goal is to determine this maximum height \\( h \\) and the total flight time of the rocket. The options provided in the question are:\nA. \\( h = 125.358 \\) m, \\( t = 27.62 \\) s  \nB. \\( h = 105.358 \\) m, \\( t = 27.62 \\) s  \nC. \\( h = 125.358 \\) m, \\( t = 24.62 \\) s  \n\nThe image does not provide any additional numerical values or specific formulas but visually represents the different phases of the rocket's motion."
