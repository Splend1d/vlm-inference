    "description": "The provided image depicts a geometric diagram consisting of a trapezoid with labeled points A, B, C, and D. The trapezoid has two parallel sides: one at the top and one at the bottom. The top side is shorter than the bottom side. Point C is located on the top side, while point A is on the bottom side. Points B and D lie on the non-parallel sides of the trapezoid, forming a triangle ABC within the trapezoid. \n\nThe height of the trapezoid is marked as 20 meters, and there is an angle of 30 degrees indicated between the line segment BC and the vertical line from point C to the bottom side. The length of the bottom side is also marked as 20 meters. \n\nHowever, the image does not contain any information related to soil properties, liquid limits, or cone settlement tests. Therefore, the image itself cannot provide any direct information to answer the question about the viscous natural state of the soil sample. The question appears to be unrelated to the content of the image."
