    "description": "The image features three cartoon characters standing side by side against a plain background. At the top of the image, the text \"value-neutrality\" is written in a simple font. \n\n- The character on the left is wearing a blue hard hat and a blue vest with the word \"PRESS\" printed on it. This character also has a camera hanging around their neck, suggesting they represent a journalist or reporter.\n  \n- The middle character is holding a clipboard and appears to be dressed in business attire, possibly representing an administrator or researcher. They have blonde hair tied back in a ponytail.\n  \n- The character on the right is dressed in formal business attire, including a suit and tie, and is depicted with a serious expression. This character might represent a professional or expert in a field related to policy or decision-making.\n\nThe overall theme of the image seems to revolve around the concept of value-neutrality, which implies maintaining objectivity and avoiding bias in professional roles such as journalism, research, and policymaking. The characters' attire and props suggest different professions where value-neutrality could be relevant."
