    "description": "The image is an AD-AS (Aggregate Demand-Aggregate Supply) diagram for Spain, with all values represented in billions. The x-axis represents Real GDP, ranging from 0 to 1100, while the y-axis represents the Price Level, also ranging from 0 to 1100. \n\nThere are three curves depicted:\n\n1. **AD (Aggregate Demand)**: This curve is downward sloping, indicating an inverse relationship between the price level and the quantity of real GDP demanded. It starts at approximately (0, 1000) and ends at around (1000, 0).\n\n2. **SRAS (Short-Run Aggregate Supply)**: This curve is upward sloping, showing a positive relationship between the price level and the quantity of real GDP supplied in the short run. It begins at roughly (0, 200) and extends to about (800, 800).\n\n3. **LRAS (Long-Run Aggregate Supply)**: This curve is vertical, indicating that in the long run, the economy's output is independent of the price level. It is positioned at a Real GDP value of 500, suggesting that this is the economy's potential output or natural level of output.\n\nThe short-run equilibrium occurs where the AD and SRAS curves intersect. In this diagram, the intersection point is located at a Real GDP value of approximately 400 and a Price Level of around 600. This indicates that the short-run equilibrium Real GDP is 400 billion."
