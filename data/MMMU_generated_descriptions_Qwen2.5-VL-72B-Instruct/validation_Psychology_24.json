    "question": "<image 1> Which part of the brain represented above is indicated by the blue region?",
    "options": "['pons', 'medulla oblongata', 'spinal cord', 'reticular formation']",
    "id": "validation_Psychology_24",
    "description": "The image shows a side view of a human brain with a section cut away to reveal internal structures. The brain appears in natural colors, primarily beige or light brown. The cerebral cortex, with its characteristic folds (gyri) and grooves (sulci), is visible at the top. Below the cerebral cortex, deeper structures like the thalamus and parts of the limbic system can be seen. \n\nAt the bottom of the image, there is a distinct area highlighted in blue. This blue region is located at the base of the brain, just above where the brainstem connects to the spinal cord. The shape and position of this blue-highlighted area correspond to the medulla oblongata, which is the lower portion of the brainstem responsible for controlling several autonomic functions such as breathing and heart rate. The blue region does not extend into the spinal cord but is clearly part of the brainstem. \n\nGiven the location and shape of the blue-highlighted area, it is specifically indicating the **medulla oblongata**. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is:\n\nB. medulla oblongata"
