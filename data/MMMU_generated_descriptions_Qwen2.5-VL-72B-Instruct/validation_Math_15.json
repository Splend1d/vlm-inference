    "question": "The top of a 25-foot ladder, leaning against a vertical wall is slipping down the wall at the rate of 1 foot per second. How fast is the bottom of the ladder slipping along the ground when the bottom of the ladder is 7 feet away from the base of the wall? <image 1>",

    "description": "The image depicts a right triangle with the hypotenuse labeled as 25 units. The triangle represents a ladder leaning against a vertical wall. The horizontal leg of the triangle is labeled \"x,\" representing the distance from the bottom of the ladder to the base of the wall. The vertical leg is labeled \"y,\" representing the height of the ladder up the wall. The figure is labeled as Fig. 14-1. The ladder forms a right angle with the ground, indicating that the wall is perpendicular to the ground. The length of the ladder (hypotenuse) remains constant at 25 units throughout the scenario described in the question."
