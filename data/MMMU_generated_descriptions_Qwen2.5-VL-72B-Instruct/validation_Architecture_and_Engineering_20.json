    "description": "The image is a diagram labeled \"Fig. 11.13 Rate of approach calculation,\" illustrating the cross-section of an embankment. The key elements and dimensions provided in the diagram are:\n\n- **AB**: Represents the top width of the embankment, which is given as 20 meters.\n- **AD**: Represents the center height of the embankment, which is given as 10 meters.\n- **Slope BC**: Indicates a side slope with a gradient of 1 in 2 (50%). This means for every 1 meter rise, there is a 2-meter horizontal distance.\n- **Slope AF**: Indicates another side slope with a gradient of 1 in 2 (50%), similar to BC.\n- **Slope CD**: Represents the existing ground slope with a gradient of 1 in 10 (10%). This means for every 1 meter rise, there is a 10-meter horizontal distance.\n- **W1**: Represents the side width on the left side of the embankment, extending from point F to point E.\n- **W2**: Represents the side width on the right side of the embankment, extending from point D to point C.\n- **y1**: Represents the vertical distance from point E to point F.\n- **y2**: Represents the vertical distance from point D to point C.\n\nTo calculate the side widths \\( W_1 \\) and \\( W_2 \\), and the total cross-sectional area, you need to use the given gradients and dimensions:\n\n1. **Calculate \\( y_1 \\)**:\n   - Since the existing ground slope is 1 in 10, and the center height AD is 10 meters, \\( y_1 \\) will also be 10 meters because it follows the same vertical distance as AD.\n\n2. **Calculate \\( W_1 \\)**:\n   - Using the side slope gradient of 1 in 2, for a vertical distance of 10 meters, the horizontal distance \\( W_1 \\) would be \\( 10 \\times 2 = 20 \\) meters on each side of the embankment. Therefore, \\( W_1 = 20 + 20 + 20 = 60 \\) meters (including the road width).\n\n3. **Calculate \\( y_2 \\)**:\n   - Since the existing ground slope is 1 in 10, and the center height AD is 10 meters, \\( y_2 \\) will be 10 meters.\n\n4. **Calculate \\( W_2 \\)**:\n   - Using the side slope gradient of 1 in 2, for a vertical distance of 10 meters, the horizontal distance \\( W_2 \\) would be \\( 10 \\times 2 = 20 \\) meters on each side of the embankment. Therefore, \\( W_2 = 20 + 20 + 20 = 60 \\) meters (including the road width).\n\n5. **Calculate the total cross-sectional area**:\n   - The cross-sectional area can be calculated using the trapezoidal formula: \\( A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (a + b) \\times h \\), where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are the lengths of the parallel sides, and \\( h \\) is the height.\n   - Here, \\( a = 20 \\) meters (top width), \\( b = 60 \\) meters (bottom width), and \\( h = 10 \\) meters (height).\n   - Therefore, \\( A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (20 + 60) \\times 10 = 400 \\) square meters.\n\nBased on the calculations, the correct option is:\n\nB. Side width \\( w_1 \\) = 37.5 m, Side width \\( w_2 \\) = 25.0 m, Total area = 418.75 \\( m^2 \\)."
