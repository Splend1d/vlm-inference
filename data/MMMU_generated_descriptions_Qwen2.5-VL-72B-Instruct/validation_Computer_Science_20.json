    "description": "The image depicts an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram for a database schema related to employees and departments within an organization. The entities included are:\n\n1. **EMPLOYEE**: This entity has attributes such as Fname (First Name), Minit (Middle Initial), Lname (Last Name), Ssn (Social Security Number), Bdate (Birth Date), Address, Sex, Salary, Super_ssn (Supervisor's Social Security Number), and Dno (Department Number). The Ssn attribute is underlined, indicating it is the primary key for this entity.\n\n2. **DEPARTMENT**: This entity includes attributes like Dname (Department Name), Dnumber (Department Number), Mgr_ssn (Manager's Social Security Number), and Mgr_start_date (Manager Start Date). The Dnumber attribute is underlined, indicating it is the primary key for this entity. There is a relationship between the DEPARTMENT and EMPLOYEE entities, where the Mgr_ssn in DEPARTMENT references the Ssn in EMPLOYEE, suggesting that a department must have a manager who is also an employee.\n\n3. **DEPT_LOCATIONS**: This entity has attributes Dnumber and Dlocation. The Dnumber is underlined, indicating it is part of the primary key for this entity. There is a relationship between DEPT_LOCATIONS and DEPARTMENT, where the Dnumber in DEPT_LOCATIONS references the Dnumber in DEPARTMENT.\n\n4. **PROJECT**: This entity includes Pname (Project Name), Pnumber (Project Number), Plocation (Project Location), and Dnum (Department Number). The Pnumber is underlined, indicating it is the primary key for this entity. There is a relationship between PROJECT and DEPARTMENT, where the Dnum in PROJECT references the Dnumber in DEPARTMENT.\n\n5. **WORKS_ON**: This entity represents the relationship between EMPLOYEE and PROJECT, with attributes Essn (Employee Social Security Number), Pno (Project Number), and Hours. The combination of Essn and Pno is underlined, indicating they form the composite primary key for this entity. Essn references the Ssn in EMPLOYEE, and Pno references the Pnumber in PROJECT.\n\n6. **DEPENDENT**: This entity includes Essn (Employee Social Security Number), Dependent_name, Sex, Bdate (Birth Date), and Relationship. The combination of Essn and Dependent_name is underlined, indicating they form the composite primary key for this entity. Essn references the Ssn in EMPLOYEE.\n\nBased on the relationships depicted in the ER diagram, specifically the relationship between DEPARTMENT and EMPLOYEE through the Mgr_ssn attribute, it suggests that a department cannot exist without having a manager who is also an employee. Therefore, the answer to the question \"Can you add a DEPARTMENT if there are no EMPLOYEEs in the database?\" is:\n\n**B. No**"
