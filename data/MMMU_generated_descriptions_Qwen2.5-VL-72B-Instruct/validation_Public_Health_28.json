    "description": "The image presents a table summarizing data from a Framingham study involving 1045 men aged 33-49 years who were followed for 10 years to monitor the development of coronary heart disease. The table categorizes the participants into five groups based on their serum cholesterol levels (measured in mg/dL) at the time of enrollment. Each group has an equal number of observations (209 individuals), and the table also lists the number of coronary heart disease cases observed in each group over the 10-year follow-up period. Here's the detailed breakdown:\n\n| Serum Cholesterol Level (mg/dL) | Number of Observations | Number of Cases |\n|----------------------------------|------------------------|-----------------|\n| 114 - 193                        | 209                    | 2               |\n| 194 - 213                        | 209                    | 11              |\n| 214 - 230                        | 209                    | 14              |\n| 231 - 255                        | 209                    | 26              |\n| 256+                             | 209                    | 32              |\n| **Total**                        | **1045**               | **85**          |\n\nThe question asks for the relative risk (RR) of developing coronary heart disease for the serum cholesterol level group 231-255 mg/dL compared to the reference group of 114-193 mg/dL. To calculate the RR, you would use the formula: \n\n\\[ \\text{RR} = \\frac{\\text{Incidence rate in exposed group}}{\\text{Incidence rate in unexposed group}} \\]\n\nWhere:\n- The incidence rate for the 231-255 mg/dL group is \\( \\frac{26}{209} \\).\n- The incidence rate for the 114-193 mg/dL group is \\( \\frac{2}{209} \\).\n\nUsing these values, the calculation yields:\n\n\\[ \\text{RR} = \\frac{\\frac{26}{209}}{\\frac{2}{209}} = \\frac{26}{2} = 13 \\]\n\nTherefore, the closest option provided is C. 12.96."
