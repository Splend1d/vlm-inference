    "question": "The arrow in this figure <image 1> is pointing to which part of the brain?",
    "options": "['parietal lobe', 'temporal lobes', 'cerebral cortex', 'occipital lobe']",
    "id": "validation_Psychology_5",
    "description": "The image is a side view illustration of the human brain with different regions color-coded. The brain is divided into four main lobes: \n\n- The **frontal lobe** is colored blue and occupies the front portion of the brain.\n- The **parietal lobe** is colored yellow and is located behind the frontal lobe.\n- The **temporal lobe** is colored pink and is situated below the parietal lobe, extending towards the bottom of the brain.\n- The **occipital lobe** is colored purple and is positioned at the back of the brain.\n\nThere is an arrow in the image pointing to the pink-colored region, which corresponds to the **temporal lobe**. The arrow specifically highlights this area, distinguishing it from the other lobes. The cerebral cortex, which is the outer layer of the brain, encompasses all these lobes but is not distinctly labeled or pointed out by the arrow."
