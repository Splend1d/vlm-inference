    "description": "The image is a black-and-white portrait of a woman with neatly styled hair, parted in the middle and curled at the sides. She is wearing a light-colored blouse or dress with a V-neckline. Around her neck, there is a necklace with a heart-shaped pendant. The background is plain and does not provide any additional context about the setting or time period. The woman appears to be looking directly at the camera with a composed expression. \n\nThe image itself does not provide direct information about the historical event mentioned in the question. However, the description of the event in the question indicates that the person was arrested for refusing to comply with racial segregation laws in a cinema in Nova Scotia in 1946. This act of defiance against racially discriminatory practices is an example of a **social deviation**, which refers to behavior that violates established norms and expectations within a society. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is:\n\nC. A social deviation"
