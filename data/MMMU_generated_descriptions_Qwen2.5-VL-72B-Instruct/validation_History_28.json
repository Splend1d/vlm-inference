    "description": "The image shows a statue of a woman dressed in traditional Japanese attire, seated with her legs folded beneath her. The statue appears to be made of stone or a similar material and is situated outdoors, with a bridge and some buildings visible in the background. Below the statue, there is text that reads: \"Murasaki wrote the world's first novel, Tale of Genji, in the 11th century C.E.\"\n\nThe text provides historical context, indicating that Murasaki, a woman, authored \"Tale of Genji,\" which is recognized as the world's first novel. This achievement suggests that women in Japan during this period were capable of making significant contributions to literature and culture. However, it does not imply that all women had equal opportunities as men or that Japanese society was not patriarchal. The image and accompanying text highlight an instance where a woman exercised considerable influence on society through her literary work. \n\nBased on this description, the image represents the characteristic that **women in Japan exercised influence on society, despite the persistence of patriarchy elsewhere** (Option A)."
