    "question": "See the following phase diagram below, where there are 5 points labeled as (A), (B), (C), (D), and (E), respectively. <image 1> At which point will the substancemce represented by the phase diagram be solely in the solid phase at equilibrium?",
    "options": "['(A)', '(B)', '(C)', '(D)', '(E)']",

    "description": "The image is a phase diagram with two axes: Pressure (in atmospheres) on the vertical axis and Temperature (in degrees Celsius) on the horizontal axis. The diagram shows three distinct regions separated by curved lines representing phase transitions. \n\n- Region A is located in the lower-left area of the diagram, below and to the left of the curved line that separates it from region B.\n- Region B is situated above and to the right of the curved line separating it from region A, but still below another curved line that separates it from region C.\n- Region C is located above the curved line that separates it from region B and to the left of a straight diagonal line that separates it from region D.\n- Region D is situated above the straight diagonal line that separates it from region C and extends towards the upper-right corner of the diagram.\n- Region E is located below the straight diagonal line that separates it from region D and extends towards the lower-right corner of the diagram.\n\nThe curved line between regions A and B represents the boundary between the solid and liquid phases. The curved line between regions B and C represents the boundary between the liquid and gas phases. The straight diagonal line between regions C and D represents the boundary between the gas and supercritical fluid phases.\n\nPoint (A) is located within region A, point (B) is within region B, point (C) is within region C, point (D) is within region D, and point (E) is within region E. \n\nRegion A corresponds to the solid phase, region B corresponds to the liquid phase, region C corresponds to the gas phase, region D corresponds to the supercritical fluid phase, and region E corresponds to the gas phase. Therefore, the substance represented by the phase diagram will be solely in the solid phase at equilibrium at point (A)."
