    "description": "The image depicts a bacteriophage, a virus that infects bacteria. The structure is composed of several labeled parts:\n\n- **A** points to the outer shell of the head region, which is hexagonal in shape.\n- **B** indicates the material inside the head region, which appears as a tangled, thread-like structure.\n- **C** labels the central part of the tail, which is a hollow tube with a helical pattern.\n- **D** points to the leg-like structures at the base of the tail, which are thin and extend outward.\n\nPart **B**, located within the head of the bacteriophage, represents the genetic material of the virus. This genetic material is typically composed of DNA or RNA and is essential for the virus's replication process. Therefore, part **B** corresponds to the viral genome."
