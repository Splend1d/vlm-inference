    "question": "Donna Donie, CFA, has a client who believes the common stock price of TRT Materials (currently $58 per share) could move substantially in either direction in reaction to an expected court decision involving the company. The client currently owns no TRT shares, but asks Donie for advice about implementing a strangle strategy to capitalize on the possible stock price movement. A strangle is a portfolio of a put and a call with different exercise prices but the same expiration date. Donie gathers the TRT option-pricing data: <image 1> Calculate, at expiration for long strangle strategy, the Maximum possible loss per share.",
    "options": "['$9.00', '$5.00', 'the Maximum  possible loss is unlimited']",

    "description": "The image provides option pricing data for TRT Materials' call and put options:\n\n- **Call Option**:\n  - Price: $5\n  - Strike Price: $60\n  - Time to Expiration: 90 days from now\n\n- **Put Option**:\n  - Price: $4\n  - Strike Price: $55\n  - Time to Expiration: 90 days from now\n\nBoth options have the same expiration date, which is 90 days from now. The current stock price of TRT Materials is $58 per share. \n\nA strangle strategy involves buying both a call option and a put option with different strike prices but the same expiration date. In this case, the call option has a higher strike price ($60), while the put option has a lower strike price ($55). \n\nTo calculate the maximum possible loss per share for a long strangle strategy at expiration, you need to consider the cost of purchasing both options. The total cost would be the sum of the call option price and the put option price, which is $5 + $4 = $9. This represents the maximum possible loss per share since the options will expire worthless if the stock price remains between the two strike prices ($55 and $60) at expiration. Therefore, the maximum possible loss per share is $9.00."
