    "description": "The image shows a mountainous landscape under clear blue skies. The terrain is rugged, with steep slopes and rocky surfaces. There are patches of snow visible in some areas, indicating a high-altitude environment. Two black arrows have been added to the image, pointing towards specific features on the mountainside.\n\nThe arrow on the left points to a narrow, elongated ridge that runs parallel to the slope. This ridge appears to be composed of loose rock and debris, and it is situated along the side of a valley. The arrow on the right also points to a similar feature: another narrow, elongated ridge made up of loose rock and debris, running parallel to the slope and situated along the side of a valley.\n\nThese ridges are distinct from the main mountain peaks and do not form part of the main ridgelines or aretes. They are located at the edges of what appear to be glacial valleys, suggesting they were formed by glacial activity. The ridges are not continuous with the main peaks and do not form a hanging valley structure. Instead, they seem to be remnants of material deposited by glaciers along the sides of the valleys."
