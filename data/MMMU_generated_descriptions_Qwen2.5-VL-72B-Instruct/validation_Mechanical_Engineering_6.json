    "question": "The aerodynamic resistance to motion of a car is nearly proportional to the square of its velocity. Additional frictional resistance is constant, so that the acceleration of the car when coasting may be written a = -C1 - C2*v^2, where C1 and C2 are constants which depend on the mechanical configuration of the car. If the car has an initial velocity v0 when the engine is disengaged, derive an expression for the distance D required for the car to coast to a stop.<image 1>",
    "options": "['$D=\\\\frac{1}{C_{2}}\\\\ln(1+\\\\frac{C_{2}}{C_{1}}v_{0}^{2})$', '$D=\\\\frac{1}{2C_{2}}\\\\ln(1+\\\\frac{C_{1}}{C_{2}}v_{0}^{2})$', '$D=\\\\frac{1}{2C_{2}}\\\\ln(1+\\\\frac{C_{2}}{C_{1}}v_{0}^{2})$']",

    "description": "The image depicts a car moving along a horizontal surface, with streamlines indicating airflow around it. The car is shown in profile view, facing right, and appears to be in motion. The streamlines curve around the front of the car, suggesting air flowing over and under the vehicle. The lines become more parallel behind the car, indicating smoother airflow after passing the vehicle. A green arrow labeled \"v\" points to the right below the car, representing the direction of motion. The car's wheels are in contact with the ground, and there is no visible indication of any external forces acting on the car other than the implied air resistance and friction. The overall scene suggests a focus on the aerodynamics and motion of the car."
