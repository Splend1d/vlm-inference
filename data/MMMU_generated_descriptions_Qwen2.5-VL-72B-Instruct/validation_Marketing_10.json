    "question": "<image 1> People visiting video rental stores often rent more than one DVD at a time. The probability distribution for DVD rentals per customer at Video To Go is given Table 4.5. There is five-video limit per customer at this store, so nobody ever rents more than five DVDs. Find the probability that a customer rents three DVDs.",

    "description": "The image displays a table labeled \"Table 4.5,\" which represents a probability distribution for the number of DVDs rented by customers at a video rental store named \"Video To Go.\" The table consists of two columns: \n\n- The first column is labeled \"x\" and lists the number of DVDs rented, with values ranging from 0 to 5.\n- The second column is labeled \"P(x)\" and provides the corresponding probabilities for each value of x.\n\nHere are the specific values in the table:\n\n- For x = 0, P(x) = 0.03\n- For x = 1, P(x) = 0.50\n- For x = 2, P(x) = 0.24\n- For x = 3, P(x) = (the value is missing in the provided image)\n- For x = 4, P(x) = 0.07\n- For x = 5, P(x) = 0.04\n\nThe question asks for the probability that a customer rents three DVDs, which corresponds to finding the value of P(x) when x = 3. However, the value for P(3) is not provided in the table. Therefore, it cannot be determined directly from the information given in the image."
