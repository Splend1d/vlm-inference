    "question": "Which of the following best depicts the relation between performance and arousal?",
    "options": "['<image 1>', '<image 2>', '<image 3>', '<image 4>', '<image 5>']",
    "id": "validation_Psychology_1",
    "description": "The provided images depict various relationships between performance and arousal level:\n\n- **Image A**: Shows an inverted U-shaped curve where performance increases with arousal up to a certain point and then decreases as arousal continues to rise. The x-axis represents \"Arousal Level\" ranging from low to high, while the y-axis represents \"Performance,\" also ranging from low to high. Performance peaks at a moderate level of arousal before declining.\n\n- **Image B**: Displays a U-shaped curve where performance is high at both low and high levels of arousal but dips significantly in the middle when arousal is moderate. The axes are similar to Image A, with \"Arousal Level\" on the x-axis and \"Performance\" on the y-axis.\n\n- **Image C**: Illustrates a flat line indicating no change in performance regardless of the arousal level. The performance remains constant across all levels of arousal, from low to high.\n\n- **Image D**: Depicts a linear positive relationship where performance increases steadily as arousal increases. The graph shows a straight diagonal line going upwards from left to right.\n\n- **Image E**: Shows a linear negative relationship where performance decreases steadily as arousal increases. The graph displays a straight diagonal line going downwards from left to right.\n\nThese descriptions should enable someone to determine which image best represents the relationship between performance and arousal based on the given options."
