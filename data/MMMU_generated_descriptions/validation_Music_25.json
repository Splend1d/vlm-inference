    "description": "The image shows a musical staff with a treble clef at the beginning. On the staff, there are two notes: one on the second line from the top and another on the fourth line from the top. The note on the second line has a flat (\u266d) symbol next to it, indicating that it is a flat note. The note on the fourth line has a natural (\u266e) symbol next to it, indicating that it is a natural note. The distance between these two notes represents an interval."
