    "question": "Express the note value of <image 1> with three dotted notes",
    "options": "['<image 2>', '<image 3>', '<image 4>', '<image 5>']",
    "id": "validation_Music_1",
    "description": "The image shows a musical note with a single flag and a dot. This note is a quarter note with a dot, which represents a duration of one and a half beats in common time (4/4). The question asks to express this note value using three dotted notes. \n\nTo determine the correct answer, we need to understand that a dotted quarter note is equivalent to a quarter note plus an eighth note. Therefore, we need to find an option where three notes add up to the same duration as a dotted quarter note.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. This option shows three notes: two quarter notes and one eighth note. Two quarter notes equal one whole note, and adding an eighth note does not match the duration of a dotted quarter note.\n\nB. This option shows three notes: two quarter notes and one sixteenth note. Two quarter notes equal one whole note, and adding a sixteenth note does not match the duration of a dotted quarter note.\n\nC. This option shows three notes: two quarter notes and one thirty-second note. Two quarter notes equal one whole note, and adding a thirty-second note does not match the duration of a dotted quarter note.\n\nD. This option shows three notes: two quarter notes and one sixteenth note. Two quarter notes equal one whole note, and adding a sixteenth note does not match the duration of a dotted quarter note.\n\nNone of the options provided correctly represent the duration of a dotted quarter note using three notes. Therefore, there is no correct answer among the given options."
