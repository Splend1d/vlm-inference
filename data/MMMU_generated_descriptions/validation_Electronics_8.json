    "description": "The image shows three different voltage waveforms labeled as (a), (b), and (c). Each waveform is plotted with voltage (v) on the y-axis and time (t) in seconds on the x-axis.\n\n1. **Waveform (a)**:\n   - The waveform is a square wave.\n   - It alternates between +1 V and -1 V.\n   - The period of the waveform is 2 seconds.\n   - The waveform starts at +1 V at t = 0 and switches to -1 V at t = 1 second, then back to +1 V at t = 2 seconds, and so on.\n\n2. **Waveform (b)**:\n   - This is also a square wave.\n   - It alternates between +1 V and -1 V.\n   - The period of the waveform is 2 seconds.\n   - The waveform starts at +1 V at t = 0 and switches to -1 V at t = 1 second, then back to +1 V at t = 2 seconds, and so on.\n   - This waveform is identical to waveform (a).\n\n3. **Waveform (c)**:\n   - This is a triangular wave.\n   - It varies linearly between +1 V and -1 V.\n   - The period of the waveform is 2 seconds.\n   - The waveform starts at -1 V at t = 0, increases linearly to +1 V at t = 1 second, then decreases linearly back to -1 V at t = 2 seconds, and so on.\n\nBased on this description, the Fourier series for the square wave in (a) and (b) can be determined. The correct option for the Fourier series of the square wave is:\n\nB. (4 / \u03c0) (sin \u03c0t + (1 / 3) sin 3\u03c0t + (1 / 5) sin 5\u03c0t + ....)."
