    "question": "A finite automaton (FA) is an abstract machine that can be used to represent certain forms of computation. <image 1> The above FA identifies which of the following regular expressions?",
    "options": "['for', '[a-z][a-z0-9]*', '([1-9][0-9]*)|0', 'none of the above']",

    "description": "The image depicts a finite automaton (FA) with four states labeled 0, 1, 2, and 3. The initial state is marked with a black dot pointing to state 0. States 1, 2, and 3 are accepting states, indicated by double circles.\n\nThe transitions between the states are as follows:\n- From state 0 to state 1: The transition occurs on input symbols '1' through '9'.\n- From state 0 to state 3: The transition occurs on input symbol '0'.\n- From state 1 to state 2: The transition occurs on input symbols '0' through '9'.\n- From state 2 to state 2: The transition occurs on input symbols '0' through '9'.\n\nBased on these transitions, the FA accepts strings that start with any digit from '1' to '9' followed by any number of digits from '0' to '9', or it accepts the string '0'. This corresponds to the regular expression:\n\n\\[ ([1-9][0-9]*) | 0 \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. ([1-9][0-9]*)|0"
