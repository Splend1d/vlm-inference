    "question": "A gas-turbine power plant operates on the simple Brayton cycle between the pressure limits of 100 and 1600 kPa.The working fluid is air, which enters the compressor at 40\u00b0C at a rate of 850 m^3/min and leaves the turbine at 650\u00b0C. Using variable specific heats for air and assuming a compressor isentropic efficiency of 85 percent and a turbine isentropic efficiency of 88 percent, determine (1) the net power output and (2) the back work ratio.<image 1>",

    "description": "The image depicts a schematic of a gas-turbine power plant operating on a simple Brayton cycle. The cycle involves four main components: a compressor, a combustion chamber, a turbine, and the net work output.\n\n1. **Compressor**: Air enters the compressor at a pressure of 100 kPa and a temperature of 40\u00b0C. The compressor increases the pressure to 1.6 MPa (1600 kPa).\n\n2. **Combustion Chamber**: After compression, the air enters the combustion chamber where it is heated to a high temperature before entering the turbine.\n\n3. **Turbine**: The heated air exits the combustion chamber at a temperature of 650\u00b0C and expands through the turbine, generating work.\n\n4. **Net Work Output**: The net work output (\\(W_{net}\\)) is indicated by an arrow pointing outwards from the turbine, representing the useful work produced by the system.\n\nThe cycle is labeled with four points:\n- Point 1: Air enters the compressor at 100 kPa and 40\u00b0C.\n- Point 2: Air exits the compressor at 1.6 MPa.\n- Point 3: Air enters the turbine after being heated in the combustion chamber.\n- Point 4: Air exits the turbine at 650\u00b0C.\n\nThe image also includes arrows indicating the direction of flow and the processes involved in the cycle."
