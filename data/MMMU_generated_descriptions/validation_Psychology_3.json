    "description": "The image is a graph that illustrates the percentage of words recalled in relation to their position in a list. The x-axis is labeled with three categories: Primacy, Intermediate, and Recency. The y-axis represents the percentage of words recalled, ranging from 0% to 100%.\n\nThe graph shows a U-shaped curve:\n- At the beginning (Primacy), the percentage of words recalled starts high and gradually decreases.\n- In the middle (Intermediate), there is a shaded area indicating a lower percentage of words recalled.\n- Towards the end (Recency), the percentage of words recalled increases again.\n\nThis pattern suggests that words at the beginning and end of a list are more likely to be recalled than those in the middle."
