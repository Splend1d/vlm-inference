    "description": "The image depicts a serene winter landscape featuring a winding path that leads across a bridge over a river. The scene is covered in snow, with trees and hills in the background. A person is walking along the path, and there are two oxen pulling a cart filled with what appears to be firewood. To the right, there is a traditional Japanese building with a thatched roof, partially covered in snow. The overall style of the artwork is reminiscent of traditional Japanese woodblock prints, characterized by its detailed line work and use of color to depict the natural environment. The image has a peaceful and tranquil atmosphere, typical of landscape art from this genre."
