    "description": "The image depicts a fluid flow system involving water at 20\u00b0C. The system consists of two reservoirs labeled as (1) and (2), connected by a network of pipes made of 8-cm-diameter cast iron. Reservoir (1) is located at an elevation of 25 meters, while reservoir (2) is at an elevation of 0 meters. \n\nThe pipes are arranged in a Y-shaped configuration with three branches:\n- Branch A extends directly from reservoir (1) to reservoir (2) with a length of 100 meters.\n- Branch B splits off from branch A and extends for 50 meters before reaching reservoir (2).\n- Branch C also splits off from branch A and extends for 70 meters before reaching a valve, which is then connected to reservoir (2).\n\nReservoir (2) is shown with two levels: one at 10 meters below the ground level and another at 30 meters below the ground level. The valve in branch C has a specified loss coefficient (Kvalve) of 0.5.\n\nThe task is to determine the flow rate from reservoir (1) when valve C is open."
