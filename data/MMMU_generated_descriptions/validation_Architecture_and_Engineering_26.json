    "question": "A, B and C are three visible stations in a hydrographic survey. The computed sides of the triangle ABC are AB = 1200 m, BC = 1442 m and CA = 1960 m. A station O is established outside the triangle and its position is to be determined by resection on A, B and C, the angle AOB and BOC being respectively 45\u00b030' and 52\u00b015'. Determine distances of OA and OC, if O and Bare on the opposite sides of line AC.<image 1>",

    "description": "The image depicts a geometric diagram involving four points: A, B, C, and O. Points A, B, and C form a triangle with the following side lengths:\n- AB = 1200 meters\n- BC = 1442 meters\n- CA = 1960 meters\n\nPoint O is located outside the triangle ABC. The angles at point O are given as follows:\n- Angle AOB = 45\u00b030'\n- Angle BOC = 52\u00b015'\n\nThe task is to determine the distances of OA and OC, given that O and B are on opposite sides of line AC."
