    "description": "The image is a geometric representation of a nonlinear optimization problem. It shows a feasible region defined by constraints and an objective function with contours. The feasible region is shaded and bounded by three lines labeled \\( g_1 \\), \\( g_2 \\), and \\( g_3 \\). The optimal point is marked within this region at coordinates (2, 1). The contours of the objective function are also shown, indicating the direction of increasing values.\n\nGiven the problem statement:\nMinimize \\((x_1 - 3)^2 + (x_2 - 2)^2\\) subject to:\n- \\( x_1^2 - x_2 - 3 \\leq 0 \\)\n- \\( x_2 - 1 \\leq 0 \\)\n- \\( -x_1 \\leq 0 \\)\n\nThe solution to this problem is indicated in the image as the point (2, 1).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nD.
