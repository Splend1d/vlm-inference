    "description": "The image shows a graph with two axes: the vertical axis labeled \"v (m/s)\" representing velocity in meters per second, and the horizontal axis labeled \"t (ms)\" representing time in milliseconds. The graph depicts a waveform with three distinct peaks labeled t1, t2, and t3. \n\n- The first peak occurs at time t1.\n- The second peak occurs at time t2, which is significantly later than t1.\n- The third peak occurs at time t3, which is even later than t2.\n\nThe waveform between t1 and t2 dips below the zero line, indicating a change in direction or phase. The waveform between t2 and t3 remains above the zero line but is less pronounced than the initial peak at t1."
