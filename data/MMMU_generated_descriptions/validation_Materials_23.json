    "description": "The image depicts a concrete pipe being suspended by two cables, labeled AB and AC. The pipe has a mass of 2 Mg (megagrams) and its center of mass is indicated by point G. Cable AB is attached to the pipe at point B and makes an angle of 30 degrees with the vertical line passing through point A. Cable AC is attached to the pipe at point C and makes an angle of 45 degrees with the vertical line passing through point A. The cables converge at point A, where they are connected to a hook or support mechanism. The task is to determine the diameter of cable AB so that the average normal stress developed in this cable is the same as in the 10-mm diameter cable AC."
