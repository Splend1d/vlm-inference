    "description": "The image shows a close-up view of a leaf with visible signs of disease. The leaf has a powdery white coating on its surface, which is characteristic of a fungal infection. The veins of the leaf are prominently visible, and there are areas where the leaf tissue appears to be discolored or damaged. The powdery white coating is distributed unevenly across the leaf surface, with some areas appearing more heavily affected than others. The overall appearance suggests a fungal infection commonly associated with certain plant diseases."
