    "description": "The image depicts a mountainous landscape with two prominent ridges highlighted by arrows. The ridges are characterized by their sharp, angular edges and appear to be formed by glacial activity. The surrounding terrain includes rugged, rocky slopes with patches of snow in higher elevations. The ridges run parallel to each other and seem to be part of a larger glacial feature."
