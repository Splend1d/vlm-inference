    "description": "The image is a table with two columns and four rows. The first column is labeled \"Ion,\" and the second column is labeled \"Ionic Radius (pm).\" The ions listed in the table are:\n\n1. Cl\u207b with an ionic radius of 181 pm.\n2. I\u207b with an ionic radius of 216 pm.\n3. S\u00b2\u207b with an ionic radius of 184 pm.\n4. Te\u00b2\u207b with an ionic radius of 221 pm.\n\nThe table provides the ionic radii for each ion in picometers (pm)."
