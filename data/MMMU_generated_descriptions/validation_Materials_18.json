    "description": "The image depicts a rectangular rubber block with dimensions of 300 mm in width (along the x-axis) and 400 mm in height (along the y-axis). The block is oriented such that its bottom left corner is labeled A, top left corner D, top right corner C, and bottom right corner B. The x-axis runs horizontally through point B, and the y-axis runs vertically through point A.\n\nThe block is subjected to a shear strain given by the equation \\(\\gamma_{xy} = 40 \\times 10^{-6}x + 20 \\times 10^{-6}y\\), where \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are in millimeters. This deformation results in the shape shown by the dashed lines, indicating that all lines parallel to the y-axis remain vertical after the deformation.\n\nTo determine the normal strain along edge BC, we need to consider the given shear strain equation and how it affects the dimensions of the block. The normal strain along edge BC can be calculated using the given shear strain equation and the dimensions of the block."
