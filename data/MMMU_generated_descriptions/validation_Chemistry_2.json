    "options": "['The Lewis structure shows ten valence electrons which is not the correct number.', 'The Lewis structure shows the electrons as distributed evenly between the carbon and oxygen but they are not.', 'The Lewis structure should show the intermolecular forces present, but it does not.', 'The Lewis structure shows the bond between carbon and oxygen as a triple bond but the real bond is actually a double bond.', 'The Lewis structure shows that the molecule has a linear shape but it is actually a bent/v-shape substance.']",

    "description": "The image depicts the Lewis structure for the molecule CO (carbon monoxide). In this structure, the carbon atom (C) is represented by a central dot surrounded by three lines, indicating three bonds. The oxygen atom (O) is represented by a dot with two lines extending from it, indicating two bonds. The lines connecting the carbon and oxygen atoms represent a triple bond, indicating that there are three pairs of shared electrons between the two atoms. Additionally, each atom has a lone pair of electrons represented by a single dot on either side of the atoms."
