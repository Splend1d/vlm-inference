    "options": "['Achieve performance levels required by the market', 'This product has ongoing sales value', 'Customers are overserved', 'Customers receive additional value']",

    "description": "The image is a graph titled \"Figure 2.24 Sustaining versus disruptive innovation.\" The graph plots \"Product Performance\" on the y-axis and \"Time\" on the x-axis. There are two main lines representing different types of technological progress:\n\n1. A dashed line labeled \"Progress due to sustaining technologies,\" which starts at a higher performance level and gradually increases over time.\n2. A solid line labeled \"Progress due to disruptive technologies,\" which starts at a lower performance level and increases more steeply over time.\n\nThere are also two horizontal lines indicating the performance demanded at different ends of the market:\n- A dotted line labeled \"Performance demanded at the high end of the market,\" which intersects with the dashed line (sustaining technologies).\n- Another dotted line labeled \"Performance demanded at the low end of the market,\" which intersects with the solid line (disruptive technologies).\n\nThe graph illustrates how sustaining technologies improve over time to meet the demands of the high-end market, while disruptive technologies start at a lower performance level but eventually surpass the performance demanded by the low-end market."
