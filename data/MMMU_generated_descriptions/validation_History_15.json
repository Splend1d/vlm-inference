    "description": "The first image depicts a muscular individual named Leonard Parkinson, identified as a Maroon resistance fighter from Jamaica around 1796. The person is shown in a dynamic pose, holding a rifle with a bayonet attached to it. The individual is wearing minimal clothing, including a cloth wrapped around their waist and what appears to be a pouch or small bag hanging from their belt. The overall appearance suggests a readiness for combat or resistance.\n\nThe second image is a map showing the major Cossack hosts of the former Russian Empire. The map includes various locations marked with numbers corresponding to different Cossack regions, such as Don, Kuban, Terek, Astrakhan, Ural, Orenburg, Semirecheniye, Siberian, Transbaikal, Amur, Ussuri, Irkutsk, and Yakutsk. The map indicates the geographical distribution of these Cossack communities across a vast area, suggesting they were located on the periphery of the Russian Empire.\n\nTogether, these images depict individuals and groups who lived on the periphery of larger states and engaged in forms of resistance or autonomous existence."
