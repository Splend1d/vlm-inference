    "description": "The image is a graph that plots the \"Amount of Effort\" on the y-axis against the \"Group Size\" on the x-axis. The x-axis ranges from 1 to 12, and the y-axis ranges from 0 to 20. The graph shows a downward trend, indicating that as the group size increases, the amount of effort decreases. There are several data points plotted on the graph, and a smooth curve connects these points, illustrating the general trend. The curve starts high at a group size of 1 and gradually declines as the group size increases, suggesting that individuals tend to exert less effort as the size of the group grows larger."
