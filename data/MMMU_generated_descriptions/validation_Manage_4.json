    "question": "Room registrations in the Toronto Towers Plaza Hotel have been recorded for the past 9 years. To project future occupancy, management would like to determine the mathematical trend of guest registration. This estimate will help the hotel determine whether future expansion will be needed. Given the following time-series data, develop a regression equation relating registrations to time (e.g., a trend equation). Then forecast year 11 registrations. Room registrations are in the thousands: <image 1>",

    "description": "The image shows a table with room registrations at the Toronto Towers Plaza Hotel over a period of 9 years. The data is presented in two rows, with each column representing a different year and the corresponding number of room registrations in thousands. Here are the details:\n\n- Year 1: 17 thousand registrations\n- Year 2: 16 thousand registrations\n- Year 3: 16 thousand registrations\n- Year 4: 21 thousand registrations\n- Year 5: 20 thousand registrations\n- Year 6: 20 thousand registrations\n- Year 7: 23 thousand registrations\n- Year 8: 25 thousand registrations\n- Year 9: 24 thousand registrations\n\nThis data will be used to develop a regression equation to forecast future room registrations."
