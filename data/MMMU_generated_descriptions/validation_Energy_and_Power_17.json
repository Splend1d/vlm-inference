    "description": "The image depicts a scenario where water from a storm drain flows over an outfall onto a porous bed. The initial depth of the water is 40 cm, and it flows with a velocity of 2 m/s. The porous bed absorbs the water at a uniform vertical velocity of 8 mm/s. The system is 5 meters deep into the paper. The question asks to find the length \\( L \\) of the bed that will completely absorb the storm water."
