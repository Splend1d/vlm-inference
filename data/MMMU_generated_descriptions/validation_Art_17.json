The sculpture is made of stone and features a reclining figure with its head resting on its hands and its legs bent at the knees. The background shows a beautiful coastal scene with clear blue water, white sandy beaches, and a few people enjoying the beach. The sky is bright blue with scattered white clouds. The overall setting suggests a tropical or subtropical location, likely in a region with historical Mayan influence."
