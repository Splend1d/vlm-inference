    "description": "The image consists of two sections labeled (a) and (b), each depicting different geometric shapes with holes cut out of them.\n\n- **Section (a)**: This section shows a circle with a rectangular hole cut out of its center. The rectangle is oriented such that its longer sides are aligned horizontally and vertically.\n- **Section (b)**: This section shows a square with a circular hole cut out of its center. The circle is perfectly centered within the square.\n\nBoth sections have labels indicating dimensions:\n- In section (a), the circle has a radius labeled as \\( r \\).\n- In section (b), the square has sides labeled as \\( u \\) and \\( v \\), and the circle has a radius labeled as \\( r \\).\n\nThe question asks to compare the moments of inertia \\( I \\) for these two sections."
