    "question": "<image 1>A beam of light passes from medium 1 to medium 2 to medium 3 as shown in the diagram. What may be concluded about the speed of light in each medium?",
    "options": "['v_3 > v_1 > v_2', 'v_1 > v_2 > v_3', 'v_1 > v_3 < v_2', 'v_2 > v_3 > v_1']",

    "description": "The image depicts a ray of light passing through three different media labeled n1, n2, and n3. The light beam enters medium n1 at an angle, then refracts as it moves into medium n2, and finally refracts again as it enters medium n3. The angles of incidence and refraction are indicated by small arrows at each boundary between the media. The path of the light beam changes direction at each interface, suggesting that the refractive indices of the media are different."
