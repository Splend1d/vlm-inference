    "description": "The image consists of four graphs labeled A, B, C, and D, each depicting the relationship between power dissipated \\( P \\) and current \\( I \\) in a component that obeys Ohm's law.\n\n- **Graph A**: This graph shows a curve where the power \\( P \\) increases rapidly as the current \\( I \\) increases. The curve starts from the origin (0,0) and rises steeply.\n  \n- **Graph B**: This graph shows a straight line that decreases linearly from the y-axis to the x-axis, indicating a negative slope.\n  \n- **Graph C**: This graph shows a straight line that increases linearly from the origin (0,0), indicating a positive slope.\n  \n- **Graph D**: This graph shows a curve that starts high on the y-axis and decreases rapidly as the current \\( I \\) increases, approaching zero.\n\nGiven that the component obeys Ohm's law, the power dissipated \\( P \\) can be calculated using the formula \\( P = I^2R \\), where \\( R \\) is the resistance. Since \\( R \\) is constant for a component obeying Ohm's law, the power \\( P \\) should increase quadratically with the current \\( I \\).\n\nTherefore, the correct graph that shows how power dissipated \\( P \\) varies with current \\( I \\) in a component that obeys Ohm's law is:\n\n**A.
