    "description": "The image shows a table comparing the cash flows for two projects, labeled Project A and Project B. The table is structured as follows:\n\n- The first column lists the time periods for the cash flows, denoted as \\( C_0 \\) through \\( C_4 \\).\n- The second column represents the cash flows for Project A.\n- The third column represents the cash flows for Project B.\n\nThe specific cash flows are as follows:\n\n- For Project A:\n  - \\( C_0 \\): -\\$200 (initial investment)\n  - \\( C_1 \\): \\$80\n  - \\( C_2 \\): \\$80\n  - \\( C_3 \\): \\$80\n  - \\( C_4 \\): \\$80\n\n- For Project B:\n  - \\( C_0 \\): -\\$200 (initial investment)\n  - \\( C_1 \\): \\$100\n  - \\( C_2 \\): \\$100\n  - \\( C_3 \\): \\$100\n  - \\( C_4 \\): \\$100\n\nThe question asks for the internal rates of return (IRR) for both projects."
