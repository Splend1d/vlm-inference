    "description": "The image consists of four different panels labeled (a), (b), (c), and (d). Each panel depicts a hypothetical room-temperature random polycrystalline grain structure for the same single-component metal, all at the same magnification.\n\n- **Panel (a)** shows a structure with large, irregularly shaped grains. The grains are relatively few in number and occupy a significant portion of the space.\n- **Panel (b)** shows a structure with medium-sized grains. The grains are more numerous than in panel (a) but still have irregular shapes.\n- **Panel (c)** shows a structure with smaller grains compared to panels (a) and (b). The grains are densely packed and have irregular shapes.\n- **Panel (d)** shows a structure with the smallest grains among the four panels. The grains are very numerous and densely packed, with irregular shapes.\n\nBased on this description, the structure expected to provide the lowest yield stress would be the one with the largest grains, which is depicted in **Panel (a)**."
