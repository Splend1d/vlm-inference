    "description": "The image shows an electrical circuit diagram labeled \"Fig. 1.\" The circuit consists of a current source \\( i(t) \\), a resistor, and a capacitor connected in parallel. The current source is given by the equation:\n\n\\[ i(t) = \\cos\\left(\\frac{2}{3}t + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) \\text{ A} \\]\n\nThe circuit elements are arranged as follows:\n- The current source is connected to a node labeled \\( n_1 \\).\n- From node \\( n_1 \\), there is a branch with a 2\u03a9 resistor.\n- Another branch from node \\( n_1 \\) has a 1\u03a9 resistor in series with a capacitor labeled \\( C \\).\n\nThe voltage across the capacitor is denoted as \\( V_C(t) \\)."
