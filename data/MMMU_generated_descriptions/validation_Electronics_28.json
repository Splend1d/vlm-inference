    "description": "The image depicts an electrical circuit diagram labeled \"Fig. 1.\" The circuit consists of various components connected in series and parallel configurations. Here is a detailed description of the circuit:\n\n1. **Voltage Source (Vs)**: There is a voltage source labeled \\( V_s = 25 \\cos(250t) \\) volts.\n2. **Resistors**: \n   - A 5\u03a9 resistor is connected in series with the voltage source.\n   - A 1\u03a9 resistor is connected in parallel with a current source.\n3. **Capacitor**: A 200\u03bcF capacitor is connected in parallel with the 5\u03a9 resistor.\n4. **Inductor**: An 80mH inductor is connected in series with the 1\u03a9 resistor.\n5. **Current Source**: An 8A current source is connected in parallel with the 1\u03a9 resistor and the inductor.\n6. **Nodes and Voltages**:\n   - Node \\( v_1 \\) is the voltage across the 5\u03a9 resistor and the capacitor.\n   - Node \\( v_2 \\) is the voltage across the 1\u03a9 resistor and the inductor.\n\nThe circuit is designed to analyze the behavior of voltages and currents under the given sinusoidal excitation. The goal is to find the voltage \\( v_2 \\) across the 1\u03a9 resistor and the inductor."
