    "description": "The image consists of three separate electrical circuits labeled as Fig. 1(a), Fig. 1(b), and Fig. 1(c). Each circuit includes resistors, inductors, and voltage sources, with switches that are closed at time \\( t = 0 \\).\n\n### Fig. 1(a)\n- **Components**: \n  - A 12V voltage source.\n  - Two resistors: 6\u03a9 and 4\u03a9.\n  - An inductor: 2H.\n- **Switch**: The switch is closed at \\( t = 0 \\).\n- **Current and Voltage Labels**: There are labels for current \\( i \\) and voltage \\( v \\).\n\n### Fig. 1(b)\n- **Components**:\n  - A 100V voltage source.\n  - Three resistors: 30\u03a9, 20\u03a9, and 4\u03a9.\n  - An inductor: 5H.\n- **Switch**: The switch is closed at \\( t = 0 \\).\n- **Current and Voltage Labels**: There are labels for current \\( i \\) and voltage \\( v \\).\n\n### Fig. 1(c)\n- **Components**:\n  - A 5A current source.\n  - Two resistors: 20\u03a9 and 10\u03a9.\n  - An inductor: 8H.\n- **Switch**: The switch is closed at \\( t = 0 \\).\n- **Current and Voltage Labels**: There are labels for current \\( i \\) and voltage \\( v \\).\n\nBased on the description provided, the question asks about the expression for voltage \\( v \\) in each case for \\( t > 0 \\) after the circuits become source-free. Specifically, it mentions Fig. 1(b) and provides four options for the voltage expression.\n\nGiven the components and the nature of the circuits, the correct answer can be determined by analyzing the behavior of the circuits after the switches are closed and the sources are removed. The correct expression for voltage \\( v \\) in Fig. 1(b) is:\n\n**Option B: -5e\\(^{-0.8t}\\) V**"
