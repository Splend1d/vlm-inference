    "description": "The image depicts a common-collector amplifier circuit, also known as an emitter follower. The circuit includes several components and their respective values:\n\n- An input voltage source labeled \\( E_s \\) is connected to the base of the transistor through a resistor \\( R_f \\) (680 \u03a9).\n- A capacitor \\( C_c \\) is placed between the base and the ground.\n- A resistor \\( R_B \\) (470 k\u03a9) is connected from the base to a negative supply voltage of -10 V.\n- The transistor has a beta (\\( \\beta \\)) value of 50 and an internal resistance \\( r_e' \\) of 50 \u03a9.\n- A resistor \\( R_E \\) (5.6 k\u03a9) is connected from the emitter to ground.\n- Another capacitor \\( C_c \\) is placed between the collector and the output voltage \\( V_{out} \\), which is labeled as 4 V (ac).\n\nThe circuit is designed to amplify the input signal while maintaining a low output impedance, characteristic of a common-collector configuration."
