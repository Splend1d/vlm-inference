    "description": "The image shows a microscopic view of muscle tissue stained with Gomori trichrome. The tissue appears to have large, irregularly shaped fibers with a blue background. Within these fibers, there are numerous small, rod-like structures that are stained pink or red. These structures are characteristic of nemaline rods, which are abnormal protein aggregates found in certain muscle disorders. The presence of these rods suggests a specific type of myopathy."
