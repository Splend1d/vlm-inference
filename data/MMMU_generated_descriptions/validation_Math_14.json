    "description": "The image shows a graph with the x-axis labeled and the y-axis labeled. The function \\( y = f(x) \\) is plotted, and it appears to be a smooth curve that intersects the x-axis at two points: one at \\( x = -2 \\) and another at \\( x = 4 \\). \n\nThere are two shaded regions labeled A and B. Region A is below the x-axis and between \\( x = -2 \\) and \\( x = 0 \\), while region B is above the x-axis and between \\( x = 0 \\) and \\( x = 4 \\). The areas of these regions are denoted as \\( a \\) for region A and \\( b \\) for region B.\n\nThe question asks about the average value of the function \\( g(x) = f(x) + 3 \\) on the interval \\([-2, 4]\\).\n\nTo find the average value of \\( g(x) \\) on the interval \\([-2, 4]\\), we need to integrate \\( g(x) \\) over this interval and then divide by the length of the interval, which is 6.\n\nThe integral of \\( g(x) \\) from \\(-2\\) to \\(4\\) can be expressed as:\n\\[ \\int_{-2}^{4} (f(x) + 3) \\, dx \\]\n\nThis can be split into two parts:\n\\[ \\int_{-2}^{4} f(x) \\, dx + \\int_{-2}^{4} 3 \\, dx \\]\n\nThe first part, \\( \\int_{-2}^{4} f(x) \\, dx \\), represents the net signed area under the curve \\( f(x) \\) from \\(-2\\) to \\(4\\). Since region A is below the x-axis and region B is above the x-axis, the net signed area is \\( b - a \\).\n\nThe second part, \\( \\int_{-2}^{4} 3 \\, dx \\), is simply the area of a rectangle with height 3 and width 6, which is \\( 3 \\times 6 = 18 \\).\n\nTherefore, the integral of \\( g(x) \\) from \\(-2\\) to \\(4\\) is:\n\\[ (b - a) + 18 \\]\n\nThe average value of \\( g(x) \\) on the interval \\([-2, 4]\\) is then:\n\\[ \\frac{(b - a) + 18}{6} \\]\n\nSimplifying this expression gives:\n\\[ \\frac{b - a}{6} + 3 \\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\\[ C. \\left( \\frac{-a + b}{6} \\right) + 3 \\]"
