    "description": "The image shows a pentagon with labeled internal angles at each vertex. The vertices are numbered from 1 to 5 in a clockwise direction. The internal angles are as follows:\n\n- Angle at vertex 1: 70\u00b0\n- Angle at vertex 2: 145\u00b0\n- Angle at vertex 3: 85\u00b0\n- Angle at vertex 4: 120\u00b0\n- Angle at vertex 5: 120\u00b0\n\nThe coordinate bearing angle of side \\( L_{12} \\) is given as \\( \\alpha_{12} = 30\u00b0 \\)."
