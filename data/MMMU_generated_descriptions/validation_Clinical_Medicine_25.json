    "options": "['The serum TSH is probably increased', 'She will probably survive for at least 10 years', 'Anti-microsomal and anti-thyroglobulin antibodies are detectable', 'A dietary iodine deficiency probably preceded its appearance', 'The patient has relatives with a similar condition']",

    "description": "The image shows a histological section of tissue under a microscope. The tissue appears to be from the thyroid gland, as indicated by the presence of follicular structures filled with colloid. The cells lining these follicles are arranged in a single layer and appear uniform in size and shape. There are no signs of inflammation or significant cellular atypia. The overall architecture of the tissue seems well-preserved, suggesting a benign process."
