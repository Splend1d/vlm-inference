    "description": "The image depicts a chemical structure of a cyclohexane ring with two substituents attached to it. One substituent is a chlorine atom (Cl), and the other is a methyl group (CH3). The chlorine atom is attached to one carbon atom of the ring, and the methyl group is attached to another carbon atom of the ring. The dashed lines indicate that these substituents are on opposite sides of the ring, suggesting a trans configuration."
