    "description": "The image depicts a molecular interaction between a small molecule (in blue) and a binding site within a larger structure (represented by a black outline). The small molecule has a benzene ring with an amide group attached to it, and an amino group extending from the amide group. The binding site includes various functional groups, including a carboxylate ion (COO\u207b), a phenylalanine (Phe) residue, and a tyrosine (Tyr) residue.\n\nThere are four labeled interactions (i, ii, iii, and iv) indicated by red dashed lines. Interaction ii involves the ammonium ion (NH\u2083\u207a) of the small molecule interacting with the carboxylate ion (COO\u207b) of the binding site. This interaction is likely an electrostatic interaction due to the opposite charges of the ammonium ion and the carboxylate ion.\n\nBased on this description, the binding interaction taking place at ii is:\n\nB. Ionic bonds"
