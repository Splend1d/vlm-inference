    "description": "The image depicts a periodic function \\( f(t) \\) plotted against time \\( t \\). The function appears to be a piecewise linear function with the following characteristics:\n\n1. For \\( -5 \\leq t < -4 \\), the function decreases linearly from 0 to -1.\n2. For \\( -4 \\leq t < -3 \\), the function remains constant at -1.\n3. For \\( -3 \\leq t < -2 \\), the function increases linearly from -1 to 0.\n4. For \\( -2 \\leq t < -1 \\), the function remains constant at 0.\n5. For \\( -1 \\leq t < 0 \\), the function decreases linearly from 0 to -1.\n6. For \\( 0 \\leq t < 1 \\), the function increases linearly from -1 to 0.\n7. For \\( 1 \\leq t < 2 \\), the function remains constant at 0.\n8. For \\( 2 \\leq t < 3 \\), the function increases linearly from 0 to 1.\n9. For \\( 3 \\leq t < 4 \\), the function remains constant at 1.\n10. For \\( 4 \\leq t < 5 \\), the function decreases linearly from 1 to 0.\n\nThe function repeats itself every 5 units of time, indicating a period of 5. The function values range from -1 to 1."
