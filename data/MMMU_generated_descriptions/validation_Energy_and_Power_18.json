    "question": "A room is kept at 25\u00b0C by a vapor-compressionrefrigeration cycle with R-134a as the refrigerant. Heat is rejected to cooling water that enters the condenser at 20\u00b0C at a rate of 0.13 kg/s and leaves at 28\u00b0C. The refrigerant enters the condenser at 1.2 MPa and 50\u00b0C and leave as a saturated liquid. If the compressor consumes 1.9 kW of power, determine the exergy destruction in the condenser. Take T0 = 20\u00b0C and $c_{p,water}$ = 4.18 kJ/kg\u22c5\u00b0C<image 1>",

    "description": "The image depicts a vapor-compression refrigeration cycle using R-134a as the refrigerant. The cycle consists of four main components: the evaporator, the expansion valve, the condenser, and the compressor.\n\n1. **Evaporator**: This component is where the refrigerant absorbs heat from the room, which is maintained at 25\u00b0C. The refrigerant enters the evaporator at a low pressure and temperature, absorbing heat and changing its state from liquid to vapor.\n\n2. **Expansion Valve**: After leaving the evaporator, the refrigerant passes through an expansion valve, which reduces its pressure and temperature, preparing it for the next stage.\n\n3. **Condenser**: The refrigerant then enters the condenser, where it releases heat to the cooling water. The cooling water enters the condenser at 20\u00b0C at a rate of 0.13 kg/s and leaves at 28\u00b0C. The refrigerant enters the condenser at 1.2 MPa and 50\u00b0C and leaves as a saturated liquid.\n\n4. **Compressor**: Finally, the refrigerant is compressed by the compressor, which consumes 1.9 kW of power. The compressed refrigerant then returns to the condenser to complete the cycle.\n\nThe cycle operates in a closed loop, with the refrigerant continuously circulating through these components to maintain the desired temperature in the room."
