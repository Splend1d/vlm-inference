The infographic illustrates the concept of dependency theory in economics, which focuses on the relationship between core nations (developed countries) and peripheral nations (underdeveloped countries).\n\nThe infographic is divided into two main sections: \"Center\" and \"Periphery.\" \n\n- **Center**: This section represents developed or core nations. It includes icons representing wealth (money bags), industrialization (factory), economic growth (bar graph), and agriculture (cow). The center is depicted as having control over the periphery.\n  \n- **Periphery**: This section represents underdeveloped or peripheral nations. It includes icons indicating poverty (empty wallet), dependence on the center (hand holding another hand), and lack of resources (sad face). The periphery is shown as being exploited by the center.\n\nThe infographic shows a flow of trade from the periphery to the center, with the center receiving 80% of the wealth and the periphery receiving only 20%. This imbalance is represented by scissors cutting the flow of wealth from the periphery to the center, symbolizing the exploitation and control exerted by the core nations over the peripheral nations.\n\nThe overall message of the infographic is that core nations exploit peripheral nations through trade and economic dominance, leading to global inequality and stratification."
