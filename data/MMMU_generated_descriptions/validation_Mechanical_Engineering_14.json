    "description": "The image depicts a mechanical system involving a drum and a mass. A 1000-kg mass is being lowered by a cable at a uniform rate of 4 m/s. The drum has a diameter of 550 mm and weighs 2.5 kN. The radius of gyration of the drum is 250 mm. The system is maintained at a uniform rate of descent by a brake on the drum, which applies a torque of 2698 N\u22c5m. The question asks for (a) the kinetic energy in the system and (b) the additional brake torque required to bring the system to rest in 0.60 seconds."
