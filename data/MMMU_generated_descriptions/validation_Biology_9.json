    "question": "You discover a transmembrane protein ALPHA that, like most transmembrane proteins, exhibits a transmembrane domain composed of alpha helices. You next discover that ALPHA serves as a channel. What is a likely amino acid sequence for some portion of the transmembrane domain?  (See <image 1> for one-letter abbreviations)",
