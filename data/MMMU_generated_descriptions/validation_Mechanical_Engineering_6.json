    "question": "The aerodynamic resistance to motion of a car is nearly proportional to the square of its velocity. Additional frictional resistance is constant, so that the acceleration of the car when coasting may be written a = -C1 - C2*v^2, where C1 and C2 are constants which depend on the mechanical configuration of the car. If the car has an initial velocity v0 when the engine is disengaged, derive an expression for the distance D required for the car to coast to a stop.<image 1>",
    "options": "['$D=\\\\frac{1}{C_{2}}\\\\ln(1+\\\\frac{C_{2}}{C_{1}}v_{0}^{2})$', '$D=\\\\frac{1}{2C_{2}}\\\\ln(1+\\\\frac{C_{1}}{C_{2}}v_{0}^{2})$', '$D=\\\\frac{1}{2C_{2}}\\\\ln(1+\\\\frac{C_{2}}{C_{1}}v_{0}^{2})$']",

    "description": "The image depicts a car moving along a flat surface with air flowing around it. The air flow is represented by curved lines, indicating the aerodynamic forces acting on the car. The car is shown in motion, with a velocity vector \\( v \\) pointing to the right, suggesting that the car is moving forward. The background includes stylized representations of air turbulence and flow patterns, emphasizing the aerodynamic resistance experienced by the car."
