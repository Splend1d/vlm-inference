    "question": "The pedigree in <image 1> shows the mode of inheritance of a human disease that is associated with mutations in Gene A. Note: Individuals marrying into this family DO NOT have the disease-associated allele unless shaded and the pedigree is completely penetrant. What is the genotype(s) of Individual 9?",

    "description": "The image is a pedigree chart representing the inheritance pattern of a genetic disease associated with mutations in Gene A. The chart consists of three generations of individuals, numbered from 1 to 19. The symbols used in the pedigree are:\n\n- Circles represent females.\n- Squares represent males.\n- Shaded symbols indicate individuals who have the disease.\n- Unshaded symbols indicate individuals who do not have the disease.\n\nThe relationships between individuals are indicated by lines connecting them. Here is a detailed breakdown of the pedigree:\n\n1. Generation 1:\n   - Individual 1 (female) is unshaded.\n   - Individual 2 (male) is unshaded.\n\n2. Generation 2:\n   - Individual 3 (male) is shaded.\n   - Individual 4 (female) is unshaded.\n   - Individual 5 (male) is unshaded.\n   - Individual 6 (female) is unshaded.\n   - Individual 7 (male) is shaded.\n   - Individual 8 (female) is unshaded.\n\n3. Generation 3:\n   - Individual 9 (female) is unshaded.\n   - Individual 10 (male) is unshaded.\n   - Individual 11 (male) is shaded.\n   - Individual 12 (female) is shaded.\n   - Individual 13 (male) is unshaded.\n   - Individual 14 (male) is unshaded.\n   - Individual 15 (female) is unshaded.\n   - Individual 16 (male) is unshaded.\n   - Individual 17 (male) is unshaded.\n   - Individual 18 (male) is shaded.\n   - Individual 19 (female) is unshaded.\n\nFrom this pedigree, we can deduce the genotype of Individual 9 based on the inheritance pattern of the disease."
