    "description": "The image shows a table with three rows and four columns. The first column lists three angles: \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b1 + \u03b2. The second column lists their respective values in degrees, minutes, and seconds. The third column lists the weights associated with each angle. The fourth column is labeled \"Adjusted values of \u03b1 and \u03b2.\"\n\nThe specific values are as follows:\n\n- For \u03b1:\n  - Value: 20\u00b010'10\"\n  - Weight: 6\n\n- For \u03b2:\n  - Value: 30\u00b020'30\"\n  - Weight: 4\n\n- For \u03b1 + \u03b2:\n  - Value: 50\u00b030'50\"\n  - Weight: 2\n\nThe question asks to determine the adjusted values of \u03b1 and \u03b2 based on these observations."
