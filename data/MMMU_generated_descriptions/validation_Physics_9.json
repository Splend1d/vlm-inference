    "description": "The image shows a uniform rod that is being held in place by a rope attached at one end and resting against a wall at the other end. The rod is oriented horizontally, with the rope pulling upwards from the left side and the wall supporting the right side. There are four labeled points along the rod: Point 1 is where the rope is attached, Point 2 is where the rod touches the wall, Point 3 is the midpoint of the rod, and Point 4 is the far end of the rod. The rod appears to be balanced, suggesting that the forces and torques acting on it are in equilibrium."
