    "description": "The image is a painting featuring a series of six figures seated at individual tables, each engaged in different activities. The figures are depicted in a stylized manner with elongated limbs and simplified features. The background is a muted gray, and there is a prominent golden line running vertically through the center of the painting, connecting the figures. Each figure is dressed in dark clothing, and the tables they are seated at are simple wooden structures. The overall style of the painting is characterized by its flat, two-dimensional appearance and the use of bold, contrasting colors. The painting has a modernist feel, with an emphasis on geometric shapes and a lack of detailed facial expressions or backgrounds."
