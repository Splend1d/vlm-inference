    "description": "The image depicts a simplified model of a transistor embedded in a large silicon substrate. The transistor is represented as a hemispherical heat source with a radius \\( r_o \\) of 0.1 mm. The silicon substrate has a thermal conductivity \\( k \\) of 125 W/m\u00b7K. The ambient temperature \\( T_\\infty \\) is given as 27\u00b0C (or 300.15 K). \n\nKey elements in the image include:\n- A hemispherical heat source labeled with a radius \\( r_o \\).\n- An arrow pointing downward from the heat source, indicating the direction of heat dissipation.\n- Labels indicating the silicon substrate and the ambient temperature \\( T_\\infty \\).\n\nThe question asks to evaluate the surface temperature of the heat source for a given heat dissipation rate \\( q \\) of 4 W."
