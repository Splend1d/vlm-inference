    "description": "The image depicts a rectangular piece of plastic with dimensions 400 mm in length (x-axis) and 300 mm in height (y-axis). The original shape of the rectangle is shown with solid lines, while the distorted shape after deformation is indicated by dashed lines. The corners of the rectangle are labeled A, B, C, and D, starting from the bottom right corner and moving counterclockwise.\n\nKey measurements and deformations are provided:\n- At corner A, the x-coordinate shifts by 3 mm to the right.\n- At corner B, the y-coordinate shifts by 4 mm upwards and the x-coordinate shifts by 5 mm to the right.\n- At corner C, the y-coordinate shifts by 2 mm upwards.\n- At corner D, there is no significant shift in either coordinate.\n\nThe shear strain \\(\\gamma_{xy}\\) at corner B can be determined using the deformation data provided for corners A and B. The shear strain is calculated as the change in angle between two originally perpendicular lines due to shear stress. In this case, the shear strain \\(\\gamma_{xy}\\) can be approximated by the ratio of the horizontal displacement at corner B to the vertical distance between corners A and B.\n\nGiven:\n- Horizontal displacement at corner B: 5 mm\n- Vertical distance between corners A and B: 300 mm\n\nThe shear strain \\(\\gamma_{xy}\\) is given by:\n\\[\n\\gamma_{xy} = \\frac{\\text{Horizontal displacement at corner B}}{\\text{Vertical distance between corners A and B}}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\\[\n\\gamma_{xy} = \\frac{5 \\text{ mm}}{300 \\text{ mm}} = \\frac{5}{300} = \\frac{1}{60}\n\\]\n\nConverting to radians:\n\\[\n\\gamma_{xy} = \\frac{1}{60} \\approx 0.0167 \\text{ radians}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the shear strain \\(\\gamma_{xy}\\) at corner B is approximately \\(1.6 \\times 10^{-3}\\) radians. The correct answer is:\n\nB. 1.6*10^(-3) rad"
