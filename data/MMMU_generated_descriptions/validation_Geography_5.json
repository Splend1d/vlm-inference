    "description": "The image depicts an electrical circuit with several current sources and branches. The circuit includes:\n\n1. A current source labeled \"2A\" pointing to the left.\n2. A current source labeled \"1A\" pointing to the right.\n3. A current source labeled \"1.5A\" pointing to the right.\n4. A current source labeled \"0.5A\" pointing to the left.\n\nThere are two main branches in the circuit:\n- Branch 1: This branch has the 2A current source and the 1A current source connected in parallel.\n- Branch 2: This branch has the 1.5A current source and the 0.5A current source connected in parallel.\n\nThe currents in these branches are labeled as I1 and I2, respectively.\n\nTo determine the values of I1 and I2, we need to consider the direction and magnitude of the currents in each branch:\n\n1. For Branch 1 (I1):\n   - The 2A current source points to the left.\n   - The 1A current source points to the right.\n   - Since these currents are in parallel, the net current in Branch 1 (I1) is the difference between the two currents: 2A - 1A = 1A.\n\n2. For Branch 2 (I2):\n   - The 1.5A current source points to the right.\n   - The 0.5A current source points to the left.\n   - Since these currents are in parallel, the net current in Branch 2 (I2) is the difference between the two currents: 1.5A - 0.5A = 1A.\n\nTherefore, the currents I1 and I2 are both 1A."
