    "description": "The image depicts a rectangular piece of rubber with dimensions of 400 mm in height (AD) and 300 mm in width (AB). The original shape is shown with solid lines, while the deformed shape is indicated by dashed lines. The deformation causes the top right corner (point C) to move outward by 3 mm along the y-axis and the bottom right corner (point B) to move inward by 2 mm along the x-axis. The deformation results in a slight skewing of the rectangle, with the top edge (CD) becoming longer and the bottom edge (AB) becoming shorter. The goal is to determine the average normal strain along the side AD."
