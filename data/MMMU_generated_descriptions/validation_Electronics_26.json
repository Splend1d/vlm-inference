    "description": "The image shows an electrical circuit diagram labeled \"Fig. 1.\" The circuit consists of resistors and capacitors connected in various configurations. Here is a detailed description:\n\n1. **Resistors:**\n   - There are three resistors in the circuit:\n     - A 2-ohm resistor (denoted as 2\u03a9).\n     - A 4-ohm resistor (denoted as 4\u03a9).\n     - A 6-ohm resistor (denoted as 6\u03a9).\n\n2. **Capacitors:**\n   - There are three capacitors in the circuit:\n     - A 5-microfarad capacitor (denoted as 5\u03bcF).\n     - A 2-microfarad capacitor (denoted as 2\u03bcF).\n     - A 4-microfarad capacitor (denoted as 4\u03bcF).\n\n3. **Connections:**\n   - The 2-ohm resistor is connected in series with the 6-ohm resistor.\n   - The 4-ohm resistor is connected in parallel with the combination of the 2-ohm and 6-ohm resistors.\n   - The 5-microfarad capacitor is connected in parallel with the 4-ohm resistor.\n   - The 2-microfarad and 4-microfarad capacitors are connected in series with each other and then connected in parallel with the 5-microfarad capacitor.\n\n4. **Equivalent Circuit:**\n   - On the right side of the diagram, there is an equivalent circuit representation with a single resistor R and a single capacitor C.\n\nThe question asks for the equivalent capacitor \\( C \\) in the equivalent circuit. To find this, we need to calculate the equivalent capacitance of the capacitors in the original circuit.\n\n**Steps to find the equivalent capacitor \\( C \\):**\n\n1. **Series Capacitance:**\n   - The 2-microfarad and 4-microfarad capacitors are in series. The formula for capacitors in series is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{1}{C_{eq}} = \\frac{1}{C_1} + \\frac{1}{C_2}\n     \\]\n     Substituting the values:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{1}{C_{eq}} = \\frac{1}{2\\mu F} + \\frac{1}{4\\mu F} = \\frac{1}{2\\mu F} + \\frac{1}{4\\mu F} = \\frac{2}{4\\mu F} + \\frac{1}{4\\mu F} = \\frac{3}{4\\mu F}\n     \\]\n     Therefore,\n     \\[\n     C_{eq} = \\frac{4\\mu F}{3} = \\frac{4}{3}\\mu F\n     \\]\n\n2. **Parallel Capacitance:**\n   - The equivalent capacitance from step 1 (\\( \\frac{4}{3}\\mu F \\)) is in parallel with the 5-microfarad capacitor. The formula for capacitors in parallel is:\n     \\[\n     C_{total} = C_1 + C_2\n     \\]\n     Substituting the values:\n     \\[\n     C_{total} = \\frac{4}{3}\\mu F + 5\\mu F = \\frac{4}{3}\\mu F + \\frac{15}{3}\\mu F = \\frac{19}{3}\\mu F\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the equivalent capacitor \\( C \\) in the equivalent circuit is:\n\\[\nC = \\frac{19}{3}\\mu F\n\\]"
