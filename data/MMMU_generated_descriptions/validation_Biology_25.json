    "question": "Consider the diagram in <image 1> regarding a mountainous region. The diagram shows the average winter temperature (left-hand y-axis) at different altitudes (x-axis) and the abundance of three tree species (right-hand y-axis) at different altitudes (x-axis). Which species is/are found below an altitude of 500m?",
    "options": "['Species 1 only', 'Species 2 only', 'Species 3 only', 'Species 1 and 2 only', 'Species 2 and 3 only']",
    "id": "validation_Biology_25",
    "description": "The image is a graph that illustrates the relationship between altitude (in meters) and two variables: average winter temperature (in degrees Celsius) and the abundance of three tree species (number per km\u00b2). \n\n- The x-axis represents altitude in meters, ranging from 0 to 2000 meters.\n- The left y-axis represents average winter temperature in degrees Celsius, ranging from -5\u00b0C to 20\u00b0C.\n- The right y-axis represents the abundance of tree species, measured in number per km\u00b2, ranging from 0 to 250.\n\nThere are four lines on the graph:\n1. A blue line labeled \"Average temperature\" that shows the decrease in temperature with increasing altitude.\n2. A black line labeled \"Species 1\" that peaks at around 500 meters altitude.\n3. A gray line labeled \"Species 2\" that peaks at around 1000 meters altitude.\n4. Another gray line labeled \"Species 3\" that peaks at around 1500 meters altitude.\n\nFrom the graph, it is clear that Species 1 is found below an altitude of 500 meters, while Species 2 and Species 3 are found at higher altitudes."
