    "description": "The image depicts a serene coastal scene with a clear blue sky and calm sea. The foreground features a sandy beach with a few small figures, possibly people, scattered along the shore. To the right, there is a prominent cliff or rocky outcrop covered in green vegetation. In the distance, several sailboats can be seen on the water, adding to the tranquil atmosphere. The overall style of the painting is characterized by small, distinct dots of color, which is indicative of pointillism, a technique used by Georges Seurat."
