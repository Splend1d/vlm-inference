    "question": "A simply supported beam is subjected to a linearly varying distributed load $q(x)=\\frac{x}{L}q_{0}$ with maximum intensity q0 at B. The beam has a length L = 4 m and rectangular cross section with a width of 200 mm and height of 300 mm. Determine the maximum permissible value for the maximum intensity, q0, if the allowable normal stresses in tension and compression are 120 MPa.<image 1>",

    "description": "The image depicts a simply supported beam labeled AB, which is subjected to a linearly varying distributed load \\( q(x) \\). The load varies from zero at point A to a maximum intensity \\( q_0 \\) at point B. The beam has a length \\( L \\) of 4 meters and a rectangular cross-section with a width of 200 mm and a height of 300 mm. The load distribution is shown by arrows pointing downward, indicating the direction of the force acting on the beam. The variable \\( x \\) represents the position along the beam, ranging from 0 at point A to \\( L \\) at point B. The maximum intensity of the load, \\( q_0 \\), is indicated at point B."
