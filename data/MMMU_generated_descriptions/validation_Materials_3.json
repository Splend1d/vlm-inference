    "description": "The image depicts a mechanical assembly where a cylindrical shaft is subjected to an axial force of 5 kN. The shaft has a diameter of 60 mm and is supported by a collar labeled \"A.\" The collar has a thickness of 2.5 mm and is positioned at a distance of 100 mm from the end of the shaft. Below the collar, there is a support structure with a height of 15 mm. The collar appears to be made of a material with a metallic finish, and it is in contact with the shaft, providing support against the axial force."
