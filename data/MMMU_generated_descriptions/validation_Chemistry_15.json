    "question": "<image 1> The diagram above represents the idealized titration curve for the reaction of sodium oxalate ($Na_2C_2O_4$) with a strong acid like hydrochloric acid ($HCl$). E and F represent the pH at the endpoints. G and H will depend on the composition of the sample with the possibility that one may not be present. In addition to water, what are the predominant species in solution at E?",

    "description": "The image shows a titration curve representing the reaction of sodium oxalate (Na\u2082C\u2082O\u2084) with a strong acid like hydrochloric acid (HCl). The x-axis represents the volume of strong acid added, while the y-axis represents the pH of the solution. The curve has two distinct plateaus labeled E and F, which correspond to the endpoints of the titration. Points G and H indicate specific volumes of acid added, with G occurring before the first plateau (E) and H occurring after the second plateau (F). The curve shows a gradual decrease in pH as the acid is added, with sharp drops at the endpoints where the reactions occur."
