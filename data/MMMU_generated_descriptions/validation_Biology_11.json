    "question": "The apparatus in <image 1> is used for SDSPAGE (polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis). Which letter indicates the anode?",
    "options": "['A', 'B', 'Neither']",

    "description": "The image depicts a schematic of a polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) apparatus. The apparatus consists of a rectangular gel sandwiched between two buffer chambers. The top chamber is labeled with the letter \"I,\" indicating the cathode, where samples are loaded into wells. The bottom chamber is labeled with the letter \"B,\" indicating the anode. The gel itself is shown with lanes containing larger and smaller fragments, which migrate through the gel under the influence of an electric field. The plastic frame supports the gel and separates the buffer chambers.\n\nBased on this description, the letter indicating the anode is:\n\nB. B"
