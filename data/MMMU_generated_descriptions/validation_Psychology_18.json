    "question": "Drug addiction is often correlated with criminal behavior, and some convicted criminals begin their prison sentence already addicted to drugs. In these cases, treatment is focused on not only helping the person overcome drug addiction, but also reducing criminal behavior upon parole. One prison decided to try to improve their current treatment options by providing additions to traditional addiction psychotherapy. They offered three different types of treatment, and investigated if those treatment types had different long-term outcomes. The first treatment included psychotherapy and medication while the individuals were incarcerated and when they were released on parole. The second treatment included psychotherapy while the individuals were in prison, and medication only once they were released on parole. The third treatment included psychotherapy while the individuals were in prison, and a referral to a clinic where individuals could get medication if they wanted it after they were released. Participants from each group were contacted a year after they were released from prison, and researchers were then able to calculate how many individuals in each treatment condition had returned to drug abuse. Table 1 shows the percentage of people in each condition who were addicted to each drug one year after being released from prison. <image 1> Which group was most susceptible to relapse?",
    "options": "['Individuals who were addicted to opiates and received medication both pre and post release.', 'Individuals who were addicted to cocaine and only received medication referrals.', 'Individuals who were addicted to opiates and received medication post release only.', 'Individuals who were addicted to cocaine and received medication both pre and post release.']",

    "description": "The image is a table titled \"Table 1\" that compares the percentage of individuals who returned to drug abuse one year after being released from prison across three different treatment conditions for two types of drugs: opiates and cocaine. The table has four columns and four rows, including the header row. The columns are labeled \"Medication referral only,\" \"Medication post-release only,\" and \"Medication pre- and post-release.\" The rows correspond to the percentages of individuals who returned to drug abuse for each treatment condition and drug type.\n\nHere are the specific values in the table:\n\n- For opiate addiction:\n  - Medication referral only: 65.6%\n  - Medication post-release only: 48.7%\n  - Medication pre- and post-release: 25.0%\n\n- For cocaine addiction:\n  - Medication referral only: 71.2%\n  - Medication post-release only: 69.8%\n  - Medication pre- and post-release: 43.2%\n\nBased on this information, the group most susceptible to relapse can be determined by identifying the highest percentage of individuals who returned to drug abuse."
