    "description": "The image shows a chair with a modern, minimalist design. The chair has a red backrest and a blue seat, both of which appear to be flat panels. The frame of the chair is constructed from dark wooden beams, which are connected at various points by small yellow blocks. The overall structure suggests a sturdy build, typical of furniture made from wood and plywood. The chair is placed on a wooden floor against a plain wall."
