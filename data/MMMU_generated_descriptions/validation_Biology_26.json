    "question": "Consider the following plasmid, pET28a, a popular expression vector that is used for protein expression in bacteria: <image 1>. You freshly purified plasmid from overnight bacterial culture using extraction kit, also known as miniprep. You confirmed the quality of plasmids by checking DNA and protein ratio (A260/280) and running them on a DNA agarose gel. They looked pure as they should be. You would now like to digest this vector for gene manipulation (molecular cloning) to generate vectors suitable for molecular cloning. If you cut the above plasmid with restriction enzyme called HindIII, the form of DNA will be changed from _________",
    "options": "['Linear to supercoiled', 'Nicked to linear', 'Nicked to supercoiled', 'Supercoiled to nicked', 'Supercoiled to linear']",

    "description": "The image depicts a circular map of the plasmid pET28a, which is commonly used for protein expression in bacteria. The plasmid is shown as a closed circle, indicating that it is in its supercoiled form. Various features of the plasmid are labeled, including the T7 promoter, lac operator, lacI promoter, KanR (kanamycin resistance gene), ori (origin of replication), f1 ori (f1 origin of replication), T7 terminator, and several other elements such as the 6xHis tag, thrombin site, RBS (ribosome binding site), and HindIII restriction site at position 173.\n\nGiven that the plasmid is depicted as a closed circle, it is in its supercoiled form. When a restriction enzyme like HindIII is used to cut the plasmid at the HindIII site, it will introduce a single cut into the circular DNA, converting the supercoiled form into a linear form. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is:\n\nE. Supercoiled to linear"
