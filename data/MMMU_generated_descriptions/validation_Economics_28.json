    "description": "The image is a graph representing the trade-off between income and leisure time for an individual with low work income (Case 1). The x-axis represents leisure time, ranging from 0 to 24 hours, while the y-axis represents income. There are two indifference curves labeled IC1 and IC2, which represent different levels of utility or satisfaction for the individual.\n\nThe graph shows two points, labeled 'a' and 'b', along the budget constraint line. Point 'a' corresponds to a higher income level but less leisure time, while point 'b' corresponds to a lower income level but more leisure time. The budget constraint line indicates the maximum amount of income the individual can earn given their choice of leisure time.\n\nGiven the context of Case 1 with low work income, the worker would likely choose point 'b', which offers more leisure time. This is because at point 'b', the worker is on a higher indifference curve (IC2) compared to point 'a', indicating a higher level of utility or satisfaction despite the lower income.\n\nTherefore, in Case 1, the worker would choose to enjoy more leisure time."
