At the top of the hierarchy is the \"Board of Directors,\" followed by the \"Chief Executive Officers.\" Below these positions, there are several departments categorized under different sectors: Health, Beauty, Food, and Admin & Finance. Each sector has its own set of roles, including Research and Development, Manufacturing, Finance and Marketing, Customer Service, Human Resources, Communications, Training/Safety, and Legal. The structure is presented in a clear, organized manner with boxes representing each role and lines connecting them to show the hierarchical relationships. The text at the top indicates that the slide is 100% editable and encourages adaptation to capture the audience's attention."
