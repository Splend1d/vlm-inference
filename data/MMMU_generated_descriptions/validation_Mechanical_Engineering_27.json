    "description": "The image depicts a quarter-circle gate labeled AB, which is submerged in water. The gate is hinged at point B and has a radius of 8 feet. The gate is 10 feet wide into the paper, indicating its depth. There is a force \\( F \\) applied vertically downward at point A, which is the top of the gate. The gate is uniform and weighs 3000 pounds-force (lbf). The question asks for the force \\( F \\) just sufficient to keep the gate from opening. The options provided are:\n\nA. \\( F = 7490 \\) lbf\nB. \\( F = 7470 \\) lbf\nC. \\( F = 7480 \\) lbf"
