    "question": "A W 8 X 28 beam of a length 10 ft is held between immoveable supports. The beam has a modulus of elasticity E = 29,000 ksi and coefficient of thermal expansion $\\alpha=6.5\\times10^{-6}/^\\circF$ . If the temperature of the beam is raised uniformly by an amount $\\Delta T=20^\\circF$ , calculate the thermal stress $\\sigma_{T}$ in the beam.<image 1>",

    "description": "The image depicts a mechanical engineering diagram of a beam held between two immovable supports labeled A and B. The beam is shown in light blue with a length \\( L \\) indicated below it. The beam is subjected to a uniform temperature change denoted as \\( \\Delta T \\). At each end of the beam, there are reaction forces labeled \\( R_A \\) and \\( R_B \\), represented by red arrows pointing away from the supports, indicating that the beam is under compression due to the temperature increase. The diagram is used to illustrate the concept of thermal stress in a beam when its temperature is uniformly increased."
