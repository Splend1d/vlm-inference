    "description": "The image depicts a P-V (pressure-volume) diagram for an ideal gas. The axes are labeled with \"P\" for pressure on the vertical axis and \"V\" for volume on the horizontal axis. There are three points labeled 1, 2, and 3 on the graph. \n\n- Point 1 is located at the top left corner of the graph.\n- Point 2 is located towards the bottom right, indicating a decrease in pressure and an increase in volume compared to point 1.\n- Point 3 is located between points 1 and 2, indicating a decrease in pressure but a smaller increase in volume compared to point 1.\n\nThe process from point 1 to point 2 is described as adiabatic, meaning there is no heat transfer (Q = 0) during this process. The process from point 2 to point 3 is described as isothermal, meaning the temperature remains constant (\u0394T = 0) during this process.\n\nBased on the adiabatic process from point 1 to point 2, we can conclude that:\n- Since the process is adiabatic (Q = 0), option B or C could be correct regarding heat transfer.\n- Since the volume increases from point 1 to point 2, the temperature must decrease (\u0394T < 0) because for an ideal gas, an adiabatic expansion results in a decrease in temperature.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement about the change in temperature and heat transferred during 1-2 is:\n\nB. \u0394T < 0, Q = 0"
