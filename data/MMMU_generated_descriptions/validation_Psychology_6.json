    "description": "The image is a graph showing the cumulative number of responses over time for different reinforcement schedules. The x-axis represents time, and the y-axis represents the cumulative number of responses. There are five different curves labeled A, B, C, D, and E, each representing a different reinforcement schedule. Each curve has a series of horizontal dashes indicating the addition of a reinforcer at various points along the curve.\n\n- Curve A shows a steep, linear increase with evenly spaced reinforcers.\n- Curve B shows a more gradual, linear increase with evenly spaced reinforcers.\n- Curve C shows a gradual increase with reinforcers occurring at irregular intervals.\n- Curve D shows a gradual increase with reinforcers occurring at increasingly irregular intervals.\n- Curve E shows a very slow increase with reinforcers occurring at very irregular intervals.\n\nBased on this description, the curve that represents a variable ratio reinforcement schedule is Curve D, as it shows reinforcers occurring at increasingly irregular intervals. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is:\n\nD. D"
