    "description": "The image shows a musical staff with a series of notes written in treble clef. The time signature is 4/4, indicating four beats per measure. The key signature has three flats, which are B-flat (B\u266d), E-flat (E\u266d), and A-flat (A\u266d). Below the staff, there are four options listed: C minor, E\u266d major, A\u266d major, and D\u266d major. The correct key of the melody needs to be circled according to these options."
