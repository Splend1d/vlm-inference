    "question": "A 32-year-old woman has the acute onset of fever, cough, and dyspnea as she is preparing to leave her work and go home. When she gets home the symptoms have abated. This scenario is repeated on multiple occasions over the next 6 weeks. On physical examination she has no abnormal findings. A transbronchial biopsy is performed after she is hospitalized with respiratory distress. The microscopic appearance of the biopsy is shown here. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? <image 1> ",
    "options": "['Influenza viral pneumonia', 'Hypersensitivity pneumonitis', 'Diffuse alveolar damage', 'Miliary tuberculosis']",

    "description": "The image shows a histological section of lung tissue under a microscope. The tissue appears to have a characteristic pattern of inflammation and cellular infiltration. There are numerous small, round cells, likely lymphocytes, scattered throughout the tissue. Additionally, there are areas of granulomatous inflammation, which are clusters of immune cells, including macrophages and multinucleated giant cells. These features suggest an immune response to an inhaled antigen or allergen. The overall appearance is consistent with a chronic inflammatory process rather than an acute infection or diffuse alveolar damage."
