    "description": "The image depicts a nondeterministic finite automaton (NFA) with five states labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. The initial state is marked as \"start\" and is connected to states 1 and 3 by epsilon transitions (\u03b5). \n\n- State 0 has an arrow pointing to it, indicating it is the start state.\n- From state 0, there are two outgoing \u03b5 transitions: one to state 1 and another to state 3.\n- State 1 has a transition labeled 'a' leading to state 2.\n- State 2 is a final state, indicated by a double circle, and has a self-loop labeled 'a'.\n- State 3 has a transition labeled 'b' leading to state 4.\n- State 4 is also a final state, indicated by a double circle, and has a self-loop labeled 'b'.\n\nBased on this description, the NFA recognizes strings that either start with an 'a' followed by any number of 'a's or start with a 'b' followed by any number of 'b's. This can be represented by the regular expression:\n\naa* | bb*"
