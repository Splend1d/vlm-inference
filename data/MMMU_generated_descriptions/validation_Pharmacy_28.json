    "question": "For the compound pictured below, identify the functional group and name the compound. The red atoms represent oxygen. <image 1>",
    "options": "['-OH,ethanol.', 'one oxygen attached to two alkyl groups,diethyl ether', 'ketonic carbonyl,propane-2-one', '-COOH,acetic acid']",
    "id": "validation_Pharmacy_28",
    "description": "The image depicts a molecular structure with three distinct atoms: two red atoms representing oxygen, one black atom representing carbon, and four gray atoms representing hydrogen. The structure shows a central carbon atom bonded to two oxygen atoms and two hydrogen atoms. The oxygen atoms are double-bonded to the carbon atom, forming a carbonyl group (-C=O). This indicates that the compound has a ketone functional group. The overall structure resembles propane-2-one (acetone), which is a common ketone."
