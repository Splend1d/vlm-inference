    "description": "The image depicts an experiment involving an electroscope, which consists of a metal rod connected to two thin metal leaves inside a glass container. The electroscope is initially uncharged. \n\nIn the first part of the image (I), a negatively charged rod is brought near the top of the electroscope but does not touch it. As a result, the leaves of the electroscope spring apart, indicating that they have become charged.\n\nIn the second part of the image (II), while the negatively charged rod is still near the electroscope, a finger touches the top of the electroscope. This causes the leaves to collapse, suggesting that the charge on the leaves has been neutralized or altered.\n\nIn the third part of the image (III), after the finger and the negatively charged rod are removed, the leaves spring apart again, indicating that the electroscope has regained a charge.\n\nBased on this sequence of events, the charge on the leaves in parts I and III can be determined."
