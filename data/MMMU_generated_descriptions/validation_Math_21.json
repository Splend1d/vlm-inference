    "description": "The image is a graph of the function \\( f_1(x) = xe^{-x} \\). The graph shows the curve of the function with respect to the x-axis. The curve starts from the origin (0,0), rises to a peak at \\( x = 1 \\), and then decreases towards the x-axis as \\( x \\) increases. The curve is entirely in the first quadrant, indicating that the function is positive for all positive values of \\( x \\). The peak at \\( x = 1 \\) suggests that this is a critical point of the function."
