The carving is executed in a relief style, with deep grooves and raised elements creating a sense of depth and movement. The overall composition is symmetrical and structured, with clear delineation between different sections of the artwork. The figures are depicted with elongated bodies and stylized features, characteristic of a particular artistic period."
