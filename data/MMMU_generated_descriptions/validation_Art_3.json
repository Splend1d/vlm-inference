    "description": "The image is a poster featuring a stylized illustration of a woman with vibrant red hair, dressed in a black dress with a flowing red skirt. The woman is depicted in a dynamic pose, with her arms raised and her head tilted back. The background is a plain, light color, which makes the figure stand out prominently. The text \"JANE Avril\" is written in bold letters below the figure. In the bottom right corner, there is a signature that reads \"H.S. Stein, Paris,\" and the year \"1899\" is also visible. The overall style of the illustration is reminiscent of Art Nouveau, characterized by its use of flowing lines and bold colors."
