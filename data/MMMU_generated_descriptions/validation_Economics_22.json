    "question": "<image 1> The central bank increases the money supply. What happens to GDP and to the price level?",
    "options": "['GDP and the price level fall.', 'GDP and the price level rise.', 'Nothing happens.']",
    "id": "validation_Economics_22",
    "description": "The image consists of two graphs. The first graph on the left shows the relationship between interest rates (r) and money supply. The vertical axis represents interest rates, and the horizontal axis represents the money supply. There are two lines: one labeled \"Supply\" and another labeled \"Demand.\" The supply line is vertical, indicating that the supply of money is fixed, while the demand line slopes downward, indicating an inverse relationship between interest rates and the demand for money.\n\nThe second graph on the right shows the relationship between the price level (PL) and GDP. The vertical axis represents the price level, and the horizontal axis represents GDP. There are two lines: one labeled \"Aggregate supply\" and another labeled \"Aggregate demand.\" The aggregate supply line slopes upward, indicating that as the price level increases, the quantity of goods and services supplied also increases. The aggregate demand line slopes downward, indicating that as the price level increases, the quantity of goods and services demanded decreases.\n\nAn arrow points from the first graph to the second graph, suggesting a causal relationship between the two.\n\nBased on this description, the central bank increasing the money supply would shift the supply curve in the first graph to the right, leading to a decrease in interest rates. This would then lead to an increase in aggregate demand in the second graph, resulting in both GDP and the price level rising. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is:\n\nB. GDP and the price level rise."
