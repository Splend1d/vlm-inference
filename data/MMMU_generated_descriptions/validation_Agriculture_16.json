    "description": "The image shows a close-up view of a plant leaf with visible signs of infection. The leaf has a green background with distinct brownish spots indicating the site of the infection. Surrounding these brown spots, there is a noticeable yellow area that appears to be a reaction to the infection. This yellow area is circular and encircles the infected spots, creating a halo-like effect around them. The rest of the leaf maintains its green coloration, but the presence of the yellow halo around the infected areas is prominent."
