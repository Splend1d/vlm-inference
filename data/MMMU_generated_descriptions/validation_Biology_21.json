    "options": "['Flagellum', 'Plasma membrane', 'Nucleus', 'Cell wall', 'Cytoplasm', 'Mitochondria', 'Centrioles']",
    "id": "validation_Biology_21",
    "description": "The image depicts a detailed diagram of an animal cell. The various parts of the cell are labeled with letters from A to H. \n\n- **A** points to the nucleus, which is the central control center of the cell.\n- **B** indicates the nuclear envelope, which surrounds the nucleus and separates it from the cytoplasm.\n- **C** labels the nucleolus, a dense region within the nucleus where ribosomal RNA is synthesized.\n- **D** points to the mitochondria, the powerhouse of the cell responsible for energy production.\n- **E** indicates the endoplasmic reticulum, a network of membranes involved in protein synthesis and transport.\n- **F** labels the Golgi apparatus, which modifies, packages, and sorts proteins and lipids for secretion or delivery to other parts of the cell.\n- **G** points to the centrosome, which contains the centrioles and helps organize the microtubules during cell division.\n- **H** indicates the plasma membrane, which encloses the cell and regulates the movement of substances in and out of the cell.\n\nBased on this description, the part of the cell labeled 'B' is the nuclear envelope."
