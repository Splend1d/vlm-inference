    "question": "What is the orientation of the Purkinje cell dendrites with respect to the granule cell axons? <image 1> ",
    "options": "['Perpendicular.', 'Parallel.']",
    "id": "validation_Basic_Medical_Science_19",
    "description": "The image depicts a Purkinje cell with its dendrites branching out in a complex, tree-like structure. The dendrites extend outward from the cell body in various directions, forming intricate patterns. The overall orientation of the dendrites appears to be predominantly perpendicular to the plane of the image, suggesting that they are oriented in multiple dimensions rather than parallel to each other."
