    "description": "The image depicts a diagram of a vessel with a coiled structure inside it. The vessel has two inlets labeled \"IN\" and two outlets labeled \"OUT.\" The coiled structure appears to be wound around the inner surface of the vessel, suggesting that it is an internal component designed to facilitate heat transfer or mixing within the vessel. The overall shape of the vessel is cylindrical with a rounded top."
