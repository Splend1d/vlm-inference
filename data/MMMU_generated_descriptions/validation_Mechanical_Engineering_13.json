    "description": "The image consists of two main parts: a top view and four options labeled (a), (b), (c), and (d). The top view shows a mechanical component with a central rectangular section flanked by two smaller rectangular sections on either side. There are also two circular features within the central rectangular section.\n\nBelow the top view, there are four different left views of the same component:\n- Option (a) shows a symmetrical view with two large circles and two small circles.\n- Option (b) shows a similar view but with one large circle and three small circles.\n- Option (c) shows a view with two large circles and two small circles, similar to option (a).\n- Option (d) shows a view with one large circle and three small circles, similar to option (b).\n\nBased on the top view, the correct left view should match the symmetry and arrangement of the circular features in the central rectangular section."
