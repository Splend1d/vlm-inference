    "description": "The image is an educational poster titled \"FOLKWAYS.\" It provides information about folkways, which are described as a category of norm roughly translated to a 'social or cultural custom.' Folkways are one of four types of norms, the others being laws, mores, and taboos.\n\nThe poster is divided into two main sections: \"DEFINITION\" and \"EXAMPLES.\"\n\nIn the \"DEFINITION\" section, folkways are defined as culturally-defined norms of etiquette that are not very serious if broken. They are mostly customary and polite. The text explains that folkways differ from other types of norms, such as taboos, mores, and laws, because they tend to be less serious. They are not illegal (like laws) and often not even norms of morality (like mores).\n\nIn the \"EXAMPLES\" section, eight examples of folkways are listed:\n1. Tucking in your Shirt\n2. Dressing Appropriately at Work\n3. Wearing a School Uniform\n4. Raising your Hand to Speak\n5. Only having Hard Drinks after 5 PM\n6. Not Spitting on the Sidewalk\n7. Working a 5 Day Week\n8. Saying Please and Thank You\n\nBased on this description, the answer to the question \"What is a <image 1>?\" would be:\n\nB. Norms for routine or casual interaction. 'Everyday behaviors.'"
