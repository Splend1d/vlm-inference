    "description": "The image features a realistic painting of a pipe against a plain background. Below the pipe, there is a caption in French that reads \"Ceci n'est pas une pipe,\" which translates to \"This is not a pipe.\" The style of the painting is reminiscent of surrealist art, and the signature in the bottom right corner appears to be that of Ren\u00e9 Magritte."
