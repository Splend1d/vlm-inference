    "description": "The image shows a graph of a sinusoidal current waveform labeled \"i(A)\" plotted against time \"t(ms).\" The vertical axis represents the current in amperes (A), ranging from -4 to 4, while the horizontal axis represents time in milliseconds (ms), ranging from -1 to 4 ms. The waveform starts at zero current at 0 ms, reaches its maximum positive value of 4 A at approximately 1 ms, then decreases to zero at 2 ms, reaches its minimum negative value of -4 A at approximately 3 ms, and returns to zero at 4 ms. This indicates a complete cycle of the sinusoidal waveform within 4 ms."
