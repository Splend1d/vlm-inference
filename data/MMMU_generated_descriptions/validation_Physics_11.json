    "question": "<image 1>A light ray is incident normal to a thin layer of glass. Given the figure, what is the minimum thickness of the glass that gives the reflected light an orange like color ($\\lambda $(air) orange light = 600nm)",
    "options": "['50 nm', '100 nm', '150 nm', '200 nm']",

    "description": "The image depicts a diagram illustrating the path of a light ray through different mediums. The light ray is shown entering from the top and passing through three layers: air, glass, and water. Each medium has a specified refractive index (n):\n\n- Air: \\( n = 1.00 \\)\n- Glass: \\( n = 1.50 \\)\n- Water: \\( n = 1.33 \\)\n\nThe thickness of the glass layer is denoted by \"t.\" The light ray is incident normal to the surface of the glass layer, meaning it strikes the glass at a perpendicular angle. The question asks for the minimum thickness of the glass layer that would cause the reflected light to have an orange-like color, with a wavelength in air of 600 nm."
