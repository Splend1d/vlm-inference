    "description": "The image shows an X-ray of a wrist, displaying both the anterior-posterior (AP) and lateral views. The X-ray reveals a fracture in the distal radius, which is the lower end of the radius bone near the wrist. This type of fracture is commonly known as a Colles' fracture. The fracture appears to involve the distal end of the radius, with displacement and angulation of the bone fragments. There is no visible fracture in the ulna or any of the carpal bones."
