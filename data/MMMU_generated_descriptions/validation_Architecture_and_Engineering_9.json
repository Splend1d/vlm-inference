    "question": "A railway embankment 400 m long is 12 m wide at the formation level. The side slope of the embankment is 2:1. The formation level at zero chainage is 107.00. The embankment has a rising gradient of 1 in 100. The ground is level across the c/l. Calculate the volume of earthwork using the prismoidal rule with the following observations:<image 1>",

    "description": "The image shows a table with two columns labeled \"Distance (m)\" and \"R.L. (m).\" The table lists distances in meters from 0 to 400 meters in increments of 100 meters. Corresponding to each distance, there is a Reduced Level (R.L.) value in meters. The R.L. values for each distance are as follows:\n\n- At 0 meters, the R.L. is 104.8 meters.\n- At 100 meters, the R.L. is 106.2 meters.\n- At 200 meters, the R.L. is 107.5 meters.\n- At 300 meters, the R.L. is 107.2 meters.\n- At 400 meters, the R.L. is 108.3 meters."
