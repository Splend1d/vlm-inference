    "question": "A machine frame is made of steel having Sy = 400 MPa and Ssy = 250 MPa. When loaded in a test fixture, the stresses were found to vary linearly with load. Two points on the surface were found to be most critical. With a 4-kN test load, stresses at these points were: point a, $\\sigma $1 = 200 MPa,$\\sigma $2 = 100 MPa; point b, $\\sigma $1 = 150 MPa, $\\sigma $2 = -100 MPa. Compute the test load at which the frame will experience initial yielding according to the maximum-normal-stress theory.<image 1>",

    "description": "The image shows two diagrams representing stress states at two different points, labeled \"a\" and \"b,\" on a machine frame made of steel. The diagrams illustrate the principal stresses acting on each point.\n\nFor point \"a\":\n- The first principal stress, \u03c31, is 200 MPa.\n- The second principal stress, \u03c32, is 100 MPa.\n\nFor point \"b\":\n- The first principal stress, \u03c31, is 150 MPa.\n- The second principal stress, \u03c32, is -100 MPa.\n\nThe stresses are depicted with arrows indicating their directions and magnitudes. The positive stresses (\u03c31 and \u03c32 for point \"a\") are shown with upward-pointing arrows, while the negative stress (\u03c32 for point \"b\") is shown with a downward-pointing arrow."
