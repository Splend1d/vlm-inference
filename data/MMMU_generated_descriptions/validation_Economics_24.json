    "description": "The image shows a statistical model output titled \"Model 2\" with the dependent variable being \"l_MARKUP.\" The model uses observations from 1 to 554 and employs heteroscedasticity-robust standard errors. The table lists various coefficients, their standard errors, t-statistics, and p-values for different variables and categories.\n\nHere are the details from the table:\n\n- **Constant**: \n  - Coefficient: 2.1149\n  - Standard error: 0.5026\n  - t-statistic: 4.2076\n  - p-value: <0.0001\n\n- **l_TURNOVER**:\n  - Coefficient: 0.8198\n  - Standard error: 0.0392\n  - t-statistic: 20.9040\n  - p-value: <0.0001\n\n- **l_CLIENTS**:\n  - Coefficient: 0.3144\n  - Standard error: 0.0727\n  - t-statistic: 4.3261\n  - p-value: <0.0001\n\n- **SALES_FORCE**:\n  - Coefficient: 0.0161\n  - Standard error: 0.0312\n  - t-statistic: 0.5154\n  - p-value: 0.6063\n\n- **SQ_SALES_FORCE**:\n  - Coefficient: -0.0024\n  - Standard error: 0.0020\n  - t-statistic: -1.1652\n  - p-value: 0.2440\n\n- **C2**:\n  - Coefficient: 0.1145\n  - Standard error: 0.0333\n  - t-statistic: 3.4323\n  - p-value: 0.0006\n\n- **C3**:\n  - Coefficient: 0.0831\n  - Standard error: 0.0442\n  - t-statistic: 1.8780\n  - p-value: 0.0604\n\n- **C4**:\n  - Coefficient: 0.0929\n  - Standard error: 0.0568\n  - t-statistic: 1.6357\n  - p-value: 0.1019\n\n- **C5**:\n  - Coefficient: 0.0812\n  - Standard error: 0.0575\n  - t-statistic: 1.4128\n  - p-value: 0.1577\n\nBased on this information, the question asks whether the null hypothesis that the coefficient associated with a level C3 branch is equal to that of a C4 branch should be rejected at the 5% significance level. The given probability \\( Prob[t(545) \\leq -2] = 0.025 \\) is provided for reference."
