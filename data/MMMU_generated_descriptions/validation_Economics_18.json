The x-axis represents Real GDP, ranging from 0 to 1200, while the y-axis represents the Price Level, ranging from 0 to 1200. There are two vertical lines on the graph: \n\n1. A black line labeled \"LRAS1\" at a Real GDP value of approximately 100.\n2. A red line labeled \"LRAS2\" at a Real GDP value of approximately 300.\n\nThe graph illustrates a shift in the LRAS curve from LRAS1 to LRAS2, indicating an increase in potential output or real GDP for Brazil."
