    "question": "Suppose that the price of basketball tickets at your college is determined by market forces. Currently, the demand and supply schedules are as follows: <image 1> Your college plans to increase total enrollment next year by 5,000 students. The additional students will have the following demand schedule: <image 2> Now add the old demand schedule and the demand schedule for the new students to calculate the new demand schedule for the entire college. What will be the new equilibrium quantity?",

    "description": "The first image shows a table with three columns: PRICE, QUANTITY DEMANDED, and QUANTITY SUPPLIED. The prices listed are $4, $8, $12, $16, and $20. The quantities demanded and supplied are as follows:\n\n- At $4, 10,000 tickets are demanded and 8,000 tickets are supplied.\n- At $8, 8,000 tickets are demanded and 8,000 tickets are supplied.\n- At $12, 6,000 tickets are demanded and 8,000 tickets are supplied.\n- At $16, 4,000 tickets are demanded and 8,000 tickets are supplied.\n- At $20, 2,000 tickets are demanded and 8,000 tickets are supplied.\n\nThe second image shows a demand schedule for new students:\n\n- At $4, 4,000 tickets are demanded.\n- At $8, 3,000 tickets are demanded.\n- At $12, 2,000 tickets are demanded.\n- At $16, 1,000 tickets are demanded.\n- At $20, 0 tickets are demanded.\n\nTo find the new equilibrium quantity, we need to add the old demand schedule (from the first image) and the demand schedule for the new students (from the second image)."
