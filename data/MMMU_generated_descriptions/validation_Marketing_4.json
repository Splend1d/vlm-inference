    "description": "The image is a bar chart with the x-axis labeled with numbers ranging from 3 to 7. The y-axis represents frequency or count, with values ranging from 0 to 8. Each bar corresponds to a number on the x-axis, indicating the frequency of that number in the dataset. \n\n- The bar for the number 3 has a height of approximately 1.\n- The bar for the number 4 has a height of approximately 1.\n- The bar for the number 5 has a height of approximately 2.\n- The bar for the number 6 has a height of approximately 4.\n- The bar for the number 7 has a height of approximately 7.\n\nThe bars increase in height as the numbers increase, indicating that higher numbers occur more frequently than lower numbers. This suggests that the distribution is skewed right."
