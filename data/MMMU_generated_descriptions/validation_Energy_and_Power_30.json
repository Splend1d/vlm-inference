    "question": "In contrast to the liquid rocket in Fig. P3.34, the solid-propellant rocket in Fig. P3.35 is self-contained and has no entrance ducts. Using a control-volume analysis for the conditions shown in Fig. P3.35, compute the rate of mass loss of the propellant, assuming that the exit gas has a molecular weight of 28. <image 1>",

    "description": "The image depicts a schematic of a solid-propellant rocket engine, labeled as \"Fig. P3.35.\" The diagram shows the flow of propellant through the combustion chamber and out through the exit section. Key information provided includes:\n\n- The propellant enters the combustion chamber.\n- Combustion occurs at a temperature of 1500 K and a pressure of 9.50 kPa.\n- The exit section has an area \\( A_e \\) of 18 cm\u00b2.\n- The exit pressure \\( p_e \\) is 90 kPa.\n- The exit velocity \\( V_e \\) is 150 m/s.\n- The exit temperature \\( T_e \\) is 750 K.\n- The molecular weight of the exit gas is given as 28.\n\nThe diagram also indicates that there are no entrance ducts, implying that the propellant is self-contained within the rocket."
