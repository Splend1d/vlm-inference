    "question": "<image 1>A sphere of mass m1, which is attached to a spring, is displaced downward from its equilibrium position as shown above left and released from rest. A sphere of mass m2, which is suspended from a string of length L, is displaced to the right as shown above right and released from rest so that it swings as a simple pendulum with small amplitude. Assume that both spheres undergo simple harmonic motion Which of the following is true for both spheres?",
    "options": "['The maximum kinetic energy is attained as the sphere passes through its equilibrium position.', 'The minimum gravitational potential energy is attained as the sphere passes through its equilibrium position.', 'The maximum gravitational potential energy is attained when the sphere reaches its point of release.', 'The maximum total energy is attained only as the sphere passes through its equilibrium position.']",

    "description": "The image depicts two different physical systems undergoing simple harmonic motion. On the left side, there is a sphere of mass \\( m_1 \\) attached to a spring. The sphere is displaced downward from its equilibrium position and then released from rest. The equilibrium position is marked, and the point of release is indicated below it.\n\nOn the right side, there is a sphere of mass \\( m_2 \\) suspended from a string of length \\( L \\). This sphere is displaced to the right from its equilibrium position and then released from rest, causing it to swing as a simple pendulum with small amplitude. The equilibrium position and the point of release are also marked for this system.\n\nBoth spheres are shown in their respective positions at the moment they are released, indicating the start of their oscillatory motion."
