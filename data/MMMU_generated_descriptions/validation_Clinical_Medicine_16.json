    "description": "The image shows a cross-sectional view of a brain with significant pathology. The brain appears to have a large, irregularly shaped lesion with a dark, necrotic center surrounded by a lighter, more solid area. The lesion is expansive and has caused significant distortion of the surrounding brain tissue. The size of the lesion is indicated by a metric ruler placed next to the brain, which measures approximately 5 centimeters in diameter. The overall appearance suggests a highly invasive and destructive process within the brain."
