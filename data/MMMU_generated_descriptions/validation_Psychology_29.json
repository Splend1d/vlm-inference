    "question": "Researchers have long studied human memory. In a classic series of studies, the German psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus investigated the storage and recall of information in memory. Based on his findings, he developed the so-called forgetting curve, a way of illustrating the rate at which people forget the information they have learned. The forgetting curve has been studied in a variety of different environments and for a variety of different stimuli. On day 1 of the memory research study, participants were asked to learn a list of items. Researchers then tracked the proportion of the list that the participants remembered as time passed. On day 2, some participants were asked to relearn the list. Again, the proportion remembered was tracked over time. On day 3, some participants were asked to relearn the list a second time, and the proportion they remembered was tracked over time. On day 4, some participants were asked to relearn the list a third time, and the proportion they remembered was tracked over time. The data from this study produced the following set of forgetting curves. Each line represents the memory of the learned or relearned list. The proportion of the list remembered is shown on the y-axis (memory), and the time interval for forgetting is shown on the x-axis (time remembered in days). <image 1> Suppose that one summer you take a training course on the maintenance and service of a certain piece of complex machinery. At the end of the course, you take a qualifying test. If you retake the test every summer for the next few years, based on the graph, how would you expect to perform on the test?",
    "options": "['Test performance would decline sharply at first but decline less and less in later years.', 'Test performance would decline gradually over the years and then stabilize.', 'Test performance would decline sharply at first and continue to decline rapidly until eventually, you were unable to remember anything at all.', 'Test performance would decline only slightly from year to year until eventually, you were unable to remember anything at all.']",

    "description": "The image is a graph titled \"Forgetting Curve,\" which illustrates the rate at which people forget the information they have learned over time. The x-axis represents the time remembered in days, ranging from 0 to 6 days. The y-axis represents memory retention, with higher values indicating better memory retention.\n\nThe graph shows four distinct curves, each representing a different stage of learning and review:\n1. **First learning exposure**: This curve starts high and drops steeply, indicating rapid forgetting immediately after initial learning.\n2. **Second review**: This curve starts lower than the first learning exposure but drops more gradually, indicating slower forgetting after the first review.\n3. **Third review**: This curve starts even lower but drops even more gradually, indicating further slowing of forgetting after the second review.\n4. **Fourth review**: This curve starts the lowest but drops very gradually, indicating minimal forgetting after the third review.\n\nEach subsequent review results in a flatter curve, indicating that the rate of forgetting decreases with each review."
