    "description": "The image depicts a timeline of fetal development from conception to birth, highlighting critical periods of development. The timeline is divided into weeks, with illustrations of the fetus at different stages of growth. The first two weeks are labeled as the \"Period of dividing zygote, implantation, and bilaminar embryo,\" during which the fetus is usually not susceptible to teratogens. \n\nA red arrow points to the period between weeks 3 and 8, indicating a highly sensitive period for various organ systems. Below this arrow, there are bars representing different parts of the body and their critical periods of development. The bars are color-coded: yellow for less sensitive periods and red for highly sensitive periods. The organs and systems listed include the central nervous system, heart, arms, legs, eyes, teeth, palate, external genitalia, and ears. Each bar shows the specific weeks during which these parts are most vulnerable to developmental issues."
