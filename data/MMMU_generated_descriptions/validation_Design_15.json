    "description": "The image depicts a religious scene set in an architectural structure with arched columns and a serene garden in the background. The scene features two figures: one is an angel with large wings, dressed in a flowing robe, and the other is a woman seated on a stool, wearing a dark cloak over a lighter garment. The angel appears to be in a posture of reverence or announcement, while the woman listens attentively. The overall composition, use of halos around the heads of the figures, and the serene, almost sacred atmosphere suggest a religious context. The architectural elements, including the columns and arches, are reminiscent of a cloister or a church courtyard."
