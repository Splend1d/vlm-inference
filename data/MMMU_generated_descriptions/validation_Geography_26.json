    "description": "The image depicts a technical drawing or schematic of a rectangular structure with various dimensions labeled. The structure appears to be divided into sections, with specific measurements provided for each section. Here are the key details:\n\n1. The overall dimensions of the rectangle are:\n   - Length: 2600 units\n   - Width: 1600 units\n\n2. Inside the rectangle, there is a central square section with dimensions:\n   - Side length: 600 units\n\n3. Surrounding the central square, there are four smaller square sections, each with dimensions:\n   - Side length: 400 units\n\n4. The distances from the edges of the rectangle to the central square and the surrounding squares are labeled as follows:\n   - From the top edge to the top of the central square: 1000 units\n   - From the bottom edge to the bottom of the central square: 1000 units\n   - From the left edge to the left side of the central square: 1000 units\n   - From the right edge to the right side of the central square: 1000 units\n\n5. There are additional measurements indicating the distances between the central square and the surrounding squares:\n   - Distance from the central square to the top of the surrounding squares: 300 units\n   - Distance from the central square to the bottom of the surrounding squares: 300 units\n   - Distance from the central square to the left of the surrounding squares: 300 units\n   - Distance from the central square to the right of the surrounding squares: 300 units\n\n6. The axes labeled 'x' and 'y' indicate the coordinate system used in the drawing, with the origin at the center of the rectangle.\n\nBased on this description, the image does not provide any information related to rock mass structures or the \"Code for Geological Investigation of Water Resources and Hydropower Engineering\" (GB Classification of Rock Mass Structure for 50287-99). Therefore, the image cannot be used to answer the question about rock mass structure types."
