    "question": "A survey line ABC crossing a river at right angles cut its banks at B and C, as shown in Fig. 2.39. To determine the width BC of the river, the following operation was carried out.A 60 m long line BE was set out roughly parallel to the river. Line CE was extended to D and mid-point F of DB was established. Then EF was extended to G such that FG = EF. Line DG was extended to cut the survey line ABC at H. GH and HB were measured and found to be 40 m and 80 m, respectively.Find the width of the river.<image 1>",

    "description": "The image depicts a geometric setup used for surveying the width of a river. The key elements and measurements are as follows:\n\n1. **Survey Line ABC**: This line crosses the river at right angles and intersects the riverbanks at points B and C.\n2. **Point B**: This is where the survey line ABC meets one bank of the river.\n3. **Point C**: This is where the survey line ABC meets the opposite bank of the river.\n4. **Line BE (60 m)**: A 60-meter-long line is set out from point B, roughly parallel to the river.\n5. **Line CE**: This line extends from point C to point E.\n6. **Point D**: This is an extension of line CE beyond point E.\n7. **Midpoint F of DB**: Point F is the midpoint of the line segment DB.\n8. **Line EF**: This line extends from point E to point F.\n9. **Point G**: This point is on the extension of line EF such that FG = EF.\n10. **Line DG**: This line extends from point D through point G.\n11. **Point H**: This is where the extension of line DG intersects the survey line ABC.\n12. **Measurements**:\n   - GH = 40 m\n   - HB = 80 m\n\nThe goal is to find the width of the river, which is the distance between points B and C."
