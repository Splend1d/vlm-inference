    "description": "The image depicts a graph with a curve that starts at the origin (0,0) and decreases as it moves to the right along the x-axis. The x-axis is labeled with numbers from 0 to 10. There is a shaded area under the curve between two vertical lines that intersect the x-axis at points labeled 6 and 7. This shaded area represents the probability or density function between these two points on the x-axis."
