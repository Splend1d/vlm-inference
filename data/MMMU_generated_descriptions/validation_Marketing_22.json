    "description": "The image shows a table with four rows and seven columns, containing numerical data. Each cell in the table contains a number representing the square footage (in 1,000 feet squared) of homes. The numbers are as follows:\n\n- First row: 1.5, 2.4, 3.6, 2.6, 1.6, 2.4, 2.0\n- Second row: 3.5, 2.5, 1.8, 2.4, 2.5, 3.5, 4.0\n- Third row: 2.6, 1.6, 2.2, 1.8, 3.8, 2.5, 1.5\n- Fourth row: 2.8, 1.8, 4.5, 1.9, 1.9, 3.1, 1.6\n\nThe data represents the square footage of 28 homes. The sample mean is given as 2.50, and the sample standard deviation is 0.8302. The distribution can be written as X ~ U(1.5, 4.5), indicating a uniform distribution between 1.5 and 4.5."
