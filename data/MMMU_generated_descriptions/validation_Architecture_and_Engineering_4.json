    "question": "As shown in the diagram, vertical leveling staffs are set up at points A and B. The level instrument is placed at point M. The reading on the A staff at the center crosshair is $a'_{M}=1.355m$, and the reading on the B staff at the center crosshair is $b'_{M}=1.455m$. When the level instrument is moved to point N, the reading on the A staff is $a'_{N}=1.585m$, and the reading on the B staff is $b'_{N}=1.485m$. What is the correct height difference $h_{AB}$ between points A and B?<image 1>",

    "description": "The image depicts a vertical leveling setup with two staffs positioned at points A and B. The level instrument is initially placed at point M, where the readings on the staffs at the center crosshair are recorded as \\(a'_M = 1.355\\) meters for staff A and \\(b'_M = 1.455\\) meters for staff B. The distance between points M and N is given as 70 meters. When the level instrument is moved to point N, the new readings on the staffs are \\(a'_N = 1.585\\) meters for staff A and \\(b'_N = 1.485\\) meters for staff B. The task is to determine the correct height difference \\(h_{AB}\\) between points A and B."
