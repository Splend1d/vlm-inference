    "description": "The image depicts a schematic of a precast concrete pile foundation. The diagram shows a single pile with a length of 30 meters extending vertically into the ground. At the top of the pile, there is a circular cap or footing. The diagram also includes a horizontal line labeled \"120 kPa\" at the bottom of the pile, indicating the pressure exerted by the soil at that depth. The label \"p0/kPa\" is shown to the right of this line, suggesting that it represents the pressure at the base of the pile."
