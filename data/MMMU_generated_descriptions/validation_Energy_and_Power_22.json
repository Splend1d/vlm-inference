    "description": "The image depicts a fluid flow system involving a smooth pipe with a diameter \\( d = 5 \\) cm. The pipe is connected to a pressurized tank at one end and discharges into an open jet at the other end. The tank is filled with water up to a height of 10 meters. The pipe has a horizontal section that extends 60 meters before turning vertically upward for 80 meters, then horizontally again for another 30 meters before discharging into the open jet. The flow rate \\( Q \\) is given as 60 m\u00b3/h. The question asks for the gauge pressure \\( p_1 \\) required in the tank to achieve this flow rate at 20\u00b0C."
