    "question": "In an experiment, researchers randomly assigned college students in an introductory calculus class into four groups. All groups were given the same set of questions in an exam, but the exam began with a brief introductory statement that differed for each group, establishing differing expectations for student performance, as follows: Group A: The introduction stated that most students are expected to pass the exam. Group B: The introduction stated that most students are expected to fail the exam. Group C: The introduction included statistics that showed female students performing worse than male students on similar exams. Group D: The introduction contained no information on expected performance. The results of the experiment are given in the bar graph below: <image 1> What phenomenon best explains the performance differences between Groups A and B?",
    "options": "['Social facilitation', 'Group polarization', 'Self-serving bias', 'Unstable attribution', 'The Pygmalion effect']",

    "description": "The image is a bar graph titled \"Score average\" with two sets of bars representing male and female students across four different groups labeled A, B, C, and D. Each group corresponds to a different introductory statement given before an exam in an introductory calculus class. The y-axis represents the score average, ranging from 50 to 95, while the x-axis lists the four groups.\n\n- **Group A**: The introduction stated that most students are expected to pass the exam.\n- **Group B**: The introduction stated that most students are expected to fail the exam.\n- **Group C**: The introduction included statistics that showed female students performing worse than male students on similar exams.\n- **Group D**: The introduction contained no information on expected performance.\n\nFor Group A:\n- Male students had an average score of approximately 85.\n- Female students had an average score of approximately 80.\n\nFor Group B:\n- Male students had an average score of approximately 70.\n- Female students had an average score of approximately 65.\n\nFor Group C:\n- Male students had an average score of approximately 75.\n- Female students had an average score of approximately 65.\n\nFor Group D:\n- Male students had an average score of approximately 70.\n- Female students had an average score of approximately 75.\n\nThe bar graph shows that the scores vary significantly between the groups, particularly between Groups A and B, where the expectations for performance were explicitly stated."
