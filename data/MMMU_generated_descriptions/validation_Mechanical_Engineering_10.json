    "description": "The image shows a bimetallic bar composed of two layers: one made of steel and the other made of aluminum. The dimensions of the bar are as follows:\n\n- Length (x-direction): 0.5 meters\n- Width (y-direction): 2 centimeters\n- Thickness (z-direction): 0.5 centimeters\n\nThe steel layer is on top, and the aluminum layer is on the bottom. The elastic modulus (E) values for the materials are given:\n- Steel: \\( E = 207 \\times 10^9 \\) Pa\n- Aluminum: \\( E = 83 \\times 10^9 \\) Pa\n\nThe coordinate system is defined with the x-axis pointing to the right and the y-axis pointing downwards."
