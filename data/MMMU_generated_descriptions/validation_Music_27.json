    "options": "['1', '3', '2', '4']",

    "description": "The image shows a musical staff with a melody written in treble clef. The melody consists of two lines of music, each containing a series of notes and accidentals (sharp, flat, and natural symbols). The key signature at the beginning of the staff indicates that the piece is in the key of A-flat major, as there are four flats (B-flat, E-flat, A-flat, and D-flat) in the key signature.\n\nEnharmonic modulation occurs when a note is rewritten using a different accidental to represent the same pitch. In this melody, there are several instances where notes are written with different accidentals but represent the same pitch:\n\n1. In the first measure, the note G is written as G-flat.\n2. In the second measure, the note F is written as E-sharp.\n3. In the third measure, the note B is written as A-sharp.\n4. In the fourth measure, the note E is written as D-sharp.\n\nTherefore, there are four instances of enharmonic modulation in the melody."
