    "description": "The image depicts a fluid dynamics scenario involving an open water jet exiting from a nozzle into sea-level air. The nozzle has a diameter of 4 cm, and the water flows through a larger pipe with a diameter of 12 cm before entering the nozzle. The water jet strikes a stagnation tube, which is used to measure the pressure at the point of impact. The centerline pressure at section (1), which is upstream of the nozzle, is given as 110 kPa. The goal is to estimate the mass flow rate of the water in kilograms per second (kg/s), assuming no losses in the system."
