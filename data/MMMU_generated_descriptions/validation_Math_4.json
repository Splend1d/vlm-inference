    "description": "The image shows a graph of a trigonometric function plotted on a Cartesian coordinate system. The x-axis ranges from -4 to 4, and the y-axis ranges from -5 to 5. The graph consists of a series of oscillations that repeat periodically. Each oscillation has a peak at y = 1 and a trough at y = -1. The graph crosses the x-axis at every integer value of x, indicating that the period of the function is 1 unit. The function starts at y = 0 when x = 0, which suggests it is a sine function rather than a cosine function. Therefore, the correct equation for the graph is:\n\n\\[ y = \\sin(2\\pi x) \\]\n\nThis matches option B: \\( y = \\sin(2\\pi x) \\)."
