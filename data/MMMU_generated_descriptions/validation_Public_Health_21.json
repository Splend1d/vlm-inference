    "question": "In February 2014, the New England Journal of Medicine published in the same issue two epidemiological trials (field trials) of inactivated EV71 vaccine conducted by scholars in China respectively. One of the studies was from Jiangsu Province, China, and the study design was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial (phase III trial), which included a total of 10,077 healthy children aged 6-35 months. The primary outcome indicator was the incidence of EV71-related hand, foot and mouth disease or herpangina, according to the 0- and 28-day immunisation schedule, using block (one group of 10 persons) randomisation, with a 1:1 allocation of study participants to EV71 vaccine or placebo, and follow-up monitoring for 12 months, and the results were shown in the table below.<image 1> The incidence of tertiary adverse reactions in placebo group was",

    "description": "The image is a table titled \"Adverse Reactions\" comparing the number of incidents between a vaccination group and a placebo group. The vaccination group consists of 5044 persons, while the placebo group consists of 4873 persons. The table is divided into several categories:\n\n1. **Serious adverse reactions**:\n   - Within 28 days after injection: Both groups have 45 incidents.\n   - Within 14 months after injection: The vaccination group has 111 incidents, and the placebo group has 131 incidents.\n\n2. **Other adverse reactions within 7 days after injection**:\n   - Any adverse reactions: The vaccination group has 2593 incidents, and the placebo group has 2639 incidents.\n   - Tertiary adverse reactions: The vaccination group has 150 incidents, and the placebo group has 158 incidents.\n\nThe table provides a clear comparison of adverse reactions between the two groups across different time frames and severity levels."
