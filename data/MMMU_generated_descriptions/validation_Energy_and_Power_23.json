    "description": "The image depicts a fluid mechanics problem involving a tank filled with water at 20\u00b0C. The tank has a 4-cm-diameter plug located at an angle of 50\u00b0 from the horizontal. The plug will pop out if the hydrostatic force on it reaches 25 N. There is also a manometer attached to the tank, showing a height \\( h \\) above the mercury level. The goal is to determine the reading \\( h \\) on the manometer when the plug pops out due to the hydrostatic force reaching 25 N."
