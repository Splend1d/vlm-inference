    "description": "The image shows four identical current-carrying wires arranged in a square pattern. Each wire has a conventional current flowing out of the plane of the page, indicated by the small circles with dots inside them. The wire on the right side of the square is labeled \"P.\" The other three wires are labeled \"4A\" and are positioned at the top, bottom left, and bottom right corners of the square."
