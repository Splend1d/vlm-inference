    "description": "The image depicts an electrical circuit with a bridge configuration. The circuit includes four resistors arranged in a diamond shape around an ammeter labeled \"A.\" The resistors have the following values: one resistor has a value of 1 ohm (\u03a9), another has a value of 2 \u03a9, and a third has a value of 3 \u03a9. The fourth resistor, labeled \"R,\" is the unknown resistance that needs to be determined. The circuit is powered by a voltage source represented by a battery symbol with a positive and negative terminal. The ammeter is placed in the middle of the bridge configuration, connecting the two branches of the circuit."
