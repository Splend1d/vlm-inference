    "description": "The image depicts a graph with eight vertices labeled \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), \\(d\\), \\(e\\), \\(f\\), and \\(h\\). The vertices are connected by edges in the following manner:\n\n- Vertex \\(a\\) is connected to vertices \\(b\\), \\(d\\), and \\(e\\).\n- Vertex \\(b\\) is connected to vertices \\(a\\), \\(c\\), \\(f\\), and \\(h\\).\n- Vertex \\(c\\) is connected to vertices \\(b\\), \\(d\\), and \\(f\\).\n- Vertex \\(d\\) is connected to vertices \\(a\\), \\(c\\), and \\(e\\).\n- Vertex \\(e\\) is connected to vertices \\(a\\), \\(d\\), and \\(f\\).\n- Vertex \\(f\\) is connected to vertices \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(e\\).\n- Vertex \\(h\\) is connected to vertex \\(b\\).\n\nFrom this description, it is clear that the graph is not regular because not all vertices have the same degree. For example, vertex \\(a\\) has a degree of 3 (connected to \\(b\\), \\(d\\), and \\(e\\)), while vertex \\(b\\) has a degree of 4 (connected to \\(a\\), \\(c\\), \\(f\\), and \\(h\\)). Therefore, the correct answer to the question is:\n\nC. not all vertices have the same degree"
