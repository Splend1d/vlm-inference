    "description": "The image depicts a simply supported beam with two supports labeled A and B. The beam has a length of 12 feet, divided into three segments: from A to C (3 ft), from C to D (3 ft), and from D to B (6 ft). The beam is subjected to a uniformly distributed load (UDL) of 6 kips per foot (kip/ft) over its entire length. The load is applied vertically downward. Points C and D are marked along the beam, with C being 3 feet from support A and D being 6 feet from support A (or equivalently, 3 feet from support B). The beam is assumed to have vertical reactions at supports A and B."
