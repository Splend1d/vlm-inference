    "description": "The image shows an electrocardiogram (ECG) recording with three leads displayed. The ECG tracing exhibits a regular rhythm with consistent P waves preceding each QRS complex. The PR intervals appear to be uniform and within normal limits, indicating that the electrical impulse is consistently conducted from the atria to the ventricles without delay. There are no dropped beats or irregularities in the conduction pattern that would suggest atrioventricular (AV) block. Additionally, there are no signs of atrial flutter, such as sawtooth-like F waves.\n\nGiven these observations, the most likely diagnosis is:\n\nA. first degree atrioventricular block"
