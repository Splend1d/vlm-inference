    "question": "A particle continuously moves in a circular path at constant speed in a counterclockwise direction. Consider a time interval during which the particle moves along this circular path from point P to point Q. Point Q is exactly half-way around the circle from Point P.<image 1>What is the direction of the average velocity during this time interval?",
    "options": "['rightward', 'leftward', 'upward', 'The average velocity is zero.']",

    "description": "The image depicts a circular path with two points labeled P and Q. Point Q is located exactly halfway around the circle from point P, indicating that the particle moves from P to Q along the circular path. The direction of motion is indicated by arrows, showing that the particle moves in a counterclockwise direction. The path is a complete circle, and the distance between P and Q represents half of the circumference of the circle."
