    "description": "The image shows four musical chords labeled A, B, C, and D. Each chord is represented by a series of notes on a staff with a treble clef. \n\n- Chord A consists of three notes: an E in the middle, a G below it, and a B above it.\n- Chord B consists of three notes: an F in the middle, an A below it, and a C above it.\n- Chord C consists of three notes: an F# in the middle, an A# below it, and a C# above it.\n- Chord D consists of three notes: an F in the middle, an A below it, and a B above it.\n\nThese chords are written in a way that suggests they are in first inversion, meaning the third of the chord is in the bass (lowest) position."
