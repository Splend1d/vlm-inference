The table includes the following columns:\n\n- Index model regression estimates\n- R-square\n- Residual standard deviation, \u03c3(e)\n- Standard deviation of excess returns\n\nFor Stock A:\n- Index model regression estimate: 1% + 1.2(r_M - r_f)\n- R-square: .576\n- Residual standard deviation, \u03c3(e): 10.3%\n- Standard deviation of excess returns: 21.6%\n\nFor Stock B:\n- Index model regression estimate: 2% + .8(r_M - r_f)\n- R-square: .436\n- Residual standard deviation, \u03c3(e): 19.1%\n- Standard deviation of excess returns: 24.9%\n\nThe risk-free rate over the period was 6%, and the market's average return was 14%.
