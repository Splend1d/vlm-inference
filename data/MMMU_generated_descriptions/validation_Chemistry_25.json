    "description": "The image shows a table with three rows and three columns. The first column is labeled \"Isotope,\" the second column is labeled \"Mass (amu),\" and the third column is labeled \"Percent Abundance.\" Each row corresponds to an isotope of magnesium:\n\n- The first row lists Mg-24 with a mass of 24.0 amu and a percent abundance of 79.0%.\n- The second row lists Mg-25 with a mass of 25.0 amu and a percent abundance of 10.0%.\n- The third row lists Mg-26 with a mass of 26.0 amu and a percent abundance of 11.0%.\n\nUsing this information, you can calculate the average atomic mass of magnesium by multiplying each isotope's mass by its percent abundance (converted to a decimal), summing these products, and then dividing by 100."
