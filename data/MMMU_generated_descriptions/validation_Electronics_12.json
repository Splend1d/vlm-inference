    "description": "The image shows a basic transistor circuit diagram labeled \"Fig. 1.\" The circuit consists of a bipolar junction transistor (BJT) with its base, collector, and emitter terminals clearly marked. The base of the transistor is connected to a resistor \\( R_B \\), which is labeled as 960 kilo-ohms (\\( 960k\\Omega \\)). The collector of the transistor is connected to a resistor \\( R_C \\), which is labeled as 7 kilo-ohms (\\( 7k\\Omega \\)). The collector is also connected to a voltage source labeled \\( V_{CC} \\), which is specified as 24 volts. The emitter of the transistor is connected to ground, indicated by the ground symbol.\n\nThe currents flowing through the base, collector, and emitter are denoted as \\( I_B \\), \\( I_C \\), and \\( I_E \\) respectively. The beta (\\( \\beta \\)) of the transistor is given as 80, indicating the current gain of the transistor. The leakage current is mentioned to be negligible.\n\nGiven these details, the question asks for the value of \\( V_{CE} \\), the collector-to-emitter voltage, under the specified conditions."
