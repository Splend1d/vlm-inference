    "description": "The image shows a geometric diagram involving a circle with center \\( O \\). The circle has a tangent line \\( PS \\) at point \\( S \\), and a secant line \\( PQR \\) intersecting the circle at points \\( Q \\) and \\( R \\). Point \\( P \\) is outside the circle, and the lines \\( PS \\) and \\( PQR \\) extend from point \\( P \\).\n\nGiven information in the image includes:\n- \\( PS = x \\)\n- \\( PQ = 3 \\)\n- \\( PR = x + 18 \\)\n\nThe question asks for the length of \\( PS \\), which is represented by \\( x \\)."
