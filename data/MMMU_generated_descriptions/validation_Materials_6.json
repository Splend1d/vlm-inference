    "description": "The image depicts a unit cell in a three-dimensional coordinate system with axes labeled x, y, and z. The unit cell is a rectangular prism with dimensions labeled as 'a', 'b', and 'c' along the x, y, and z axes, respectively. Within this unit cell, a vector is drawn from the origin to a point located at coordinates \\((\\frac{1}{2}, -\\frac{1}{3}, c)\\). The vector extends from the origin (0, 0, 0) to this point, indicating its direction within the unit cell.\n\nTo determine the indices for the direction represented by this vector, we need to consider the intercepts of the vector with the x, y, and z axes. The vector intersects the x-axis at \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), the y-axis at \\(-\\frac{1}{3}\\), and the z-axis at \\(c\\). These intercepts correspond to the reciprocals of the indices in the Miller notation for crystallographic directions.\n\nGiven these intercepts:\n- For the x-axis: \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) corresponds to an index of 2.\n- For the y-axis: \\(-\\frac{1}{3}\\) corresponds to an index of -3.\n- For the z-axis: \\(c\\) corresponds to an index of 1.\n\nTherefore, the indices for the direction represented by the vector are [2 -3 1]. However, since the question specifies that a negative index should be indicated with a minus sign in front of the index number, the correct answer is:\n\nA. [-3 2 1]"
