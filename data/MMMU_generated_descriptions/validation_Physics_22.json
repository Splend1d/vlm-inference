    "description": "The image depicts a hydrogen atom in the Bohr model, illustrating the emission of light due to an electron transition from one energy level to another. The diagram shows concentric circles representing different energy levels (n) of the hydrogen atom. Specifically, it highlights a transition from the n=3 level to the n=2 level, with a wavy line indicating the emission of light as a result of this transition. The n=3 level is further from the nucleus compared to the n=2 level, indicating a higher energy state for the electron at n=3."
