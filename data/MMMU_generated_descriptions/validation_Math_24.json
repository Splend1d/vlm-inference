    "description": "The image depicts a right circular cone with a right circular cylinder inscribed within it. The cone has a base radius labeled \\( R \\) and a height labeled \\( H \\). The cylinder has a radius labeled \\( r \\) and a height labeled \\( h \\).\n\nThe cylinder is positioned such that its top face is parallel to the base of the cone and touches the lateral surface of the cone. The height \\( h \\) of the cylinder is measured from the base of the cone to the top face of the cylinder. The radius \\( r \\) of the cylinder is measured from the center of the base of the cylinder to its edge, which is also tangent to the lateral surface of the cone.\n\nThe image shows the cone and cylinder in a side view, with the cone's apex pointing upwards and the cylinder's axis aligned vertically. The dimensions \\( R \\), \\( H \\), \\( r \\), and \\( h \\) are clearly marked on the diagram."
