    "description": "The image depicts a simple electrical circuit consisting of a voltage source \\( v_C \\) connected in series with a capacitor labeled \\( C = 10^{-5} \\text{ F} \\). The current flowing through the circuit is denoted by \\( I \\), and it is directed downward through the capacitor. The voltage source \\( v_C \\) is given by the equation \\( v_C = \\sin(2\\pi T) \\).\n\nTo find the expression for the current \\( I \\) and calculate its value at \\( t = 0 \\), we need to use the relationship between voltage and current for a capacitor, which is given by:\n\n\\[ I = C \\frac{dv}{dt} \\]\n\nGiven \\( v_C = \\sin(2\\pi T) \\), we differentiate \\( v_C \\) with respect to time \\( t \\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{dv}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}(\\sin(2\\pi T)) = 2\\pi \\cos(2\\pi T) \\]\n\nSubstituting this into the equation for \\( I \\):\n\n\\[ I = C \\cdot 2\\pi \\cos(2\\pi T) \\]\n\nAt \\( t = 0 \\), \\( \\cos(2\\pi T) = 1 \\) (since \\( \\cos(0) = 1 \\)):\n\n\\[ I = C \\cdot 2\\pi \\cdot 1 = C \\cdot 2\\pi \\]\n\nGiven \\( C = 10^{-5} \\text{ F} \\):\n\n\\[ I = 10^{-5} \\cdot 2\\pi = 2\\pi \\times 10^{-5} \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. \\( 2\\pi \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ A} \\)"
