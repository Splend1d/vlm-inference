    "question": "Blood glucose level is regulated by two antagonistic hormones, glucagon and insulin. The following graph shows the fluctuations in an individual's blood glucose level over a five hour period: <image 1>. From the information provided above and your knowledge of physiology, which of the following statements are appropriate? I. Normal homeostatic mechanisms maintain a glucose concentration of approximately 1 mg/ml. II. Glucagon is released at points A and C. III. The individual eats a meal at point D. IV. Insulin is being released at points B and E.",
    "options": "['I only', 'I and II only', 'I and IV only', 'I, II, and III only', 'II, III, and IV only']",

    "description": "The image is a graph showing the fluctuations in an individual's blood glucose level over a five-hour period. The x-axis represents time in hours, ranging from 0 to 5 hours, while the y-axis represents blood glucose level in milligrams per milliliter (mg/ml), ranging from 0.0 to 1.8 mg/ml.\n\nKey points on the graph are labeled as follows:\n- Point A: At the start of the graph, the blood glucose level is approximately 1.0 mg/ml.\n- Point B: After about 1 hour, the blood glucose level peaks at around 1.6 mg/ml.\n- Point C: The blood glucose level then decreases and reaches a low point at around 2 hours, where it is approximately 0.7 mg/ml.\n- Point D: At 2 hours, there is a sharp increase in the blood glucose level, indicating a rise back up.\n- Point E: Around 3 hours, the blood glucose level peaks again at around 1.2 mg/ml before gradually decreasing.\n\nThe graph shows a fluctuation in blood glucose levels, with initial stability, followed by a peak, a drop, another peak, and then stabilization."
