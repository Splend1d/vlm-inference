    "question": "The storage height of a small homogeneous earth dam is 16m, and the flow network is shown in Figure 1-5. The interval of the water head gradient equipotential lines in the flow network is evenly divided into m=22 (the number of equipotential lines calculated from downstream is shown in the figure). The G point in the earth dam is located on the 20th equipotential line, 11.5m above the ground level. May I ask which of the following options is the closest to the pore water pressure at point G? ()<image 1>",
    "options": "['30kPa', '45kPa', '115kPa', '145kPa']",

    "description": "The image depicts a cross-sectional view of a small homogeneous earth dam with a storage height of 16 meters. The flow network within the dam is illustrated with equipotential lines, which are evenly spaced and numbered from 1 to 22. The G point, located on the 20th equipotential line, is situated 11.5 meters above the ground level. The equipotential lines indicate the distribution of water pressure within the dam."
