The x-axis represents three levels of exposure to media violence: Low, Medium, and High. The y-axis measures the percentage of aggressive behavior, ranging from 0% to 100%.\n\nThere are two sets of bars for each level of exposure:\n- Light gray bars represent elementary school girls.\n- Dark gray bars represent elementary school boys.\n\nFor the \"Low\" exposure level:\n- Elementary school girls show approximately 20% aggressive behavior.\n- Elementary school boys show approximately 50% aggressive behavior.\n\nFor the \"Medium\" exposure level:\n- Elementary school girls show approximately 30% aggressive behavior.\n- Elementary school boys show approximately 60% aggressive behavior.\n\nFor the \"High\" exposure level:\n- Elementary school girls show approximately 60% aggressive behavior.\n- Elementary school boys show approximately 80% aggressive behavior.\n\nThe graph shows a clear trend where both groups exhibit increased aggressive behavior with higher exposure to media violence."
