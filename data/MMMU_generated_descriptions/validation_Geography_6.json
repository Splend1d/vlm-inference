    "description": "The image depicts a mechanical engineering diagram of a rectangular plate or beam labeled with various points and forces. The plate is supported at point E, which is located at the bottom right corner. The plate has a horizontal line AB at the bottom and a horizontal line CD at the top. There are two vertical lines AH and BG connecting the top and bottom horizontal lines.\n\nKey elements in the diagram include:\n- Points A, B, C, D, E, H, and G.\n- Forces T_H and T_G acting vertically upward at points H and G, respectively.\n- A force Q acting downward at point O, which is the center of the plate.\n- The plate is supported by a hinge at point E.\n\nThe question asks for the bending moment M_DA (unit: kN\u00b7m) at point D."
