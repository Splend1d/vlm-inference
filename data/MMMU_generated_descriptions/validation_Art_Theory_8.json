    "description": "The image depicts a dramatic scene of a group of people on a makeshift raft in the middle of a stormy sea. The sky is dark and tumultuous, with clouds swirling overhead. The raft is constructed from various pieces of wood and debris, and it appears to be in a state of disrepair. Several individuals are lying on the raft, some appearing to be dead or unconscious, while others are struggling to survive. One person is standing at the top of the raft, holding a flag or piece of cloth aloft, possibly signaling for help. The overall atmosphere is one of desperation and horror, with waves crashing around the raft and the sea appearing treacherous. The lighting in the painting is dramatic, with sharp contrasts between light and shadow, highlighting the intensity of the moment."
