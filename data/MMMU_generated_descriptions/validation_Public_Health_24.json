    "description": "The image is a line graph showing the onset, duration, recovery, and death of cases of a disease over time. The x-axis represents dates from January 1, 2010, to January 1, 2011, while the y-axis represents case serial numbers ranging from 1 to 20. Each case is represented by a horizontal line that starts at the onset date (marked by a circle) and ends either at the recovery date (marked by a triangle) or the death date (marked by an 'X'). The duration of each case is indicated by the length of the line between the onset and recovery/death markers.\n\nTo determine the incidence of the disease in 2010, we need to count the number of cases that started in 2010. From the graph, we can see that there are 10 cases that began in 2010. \n\nGiven that the population of the area at the beginning of 2010 was 2,528, we can calculate the incidence rate as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Incidence} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Number of new cases in 2010}}{\\text{Population at the beginning of 2010}} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Incidence} = \\left( \\frac{10}{2528} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Incidence} = 0.3957\\% \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the incidence in 2010 is approximately 0.40%.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nB. 0.40%"
