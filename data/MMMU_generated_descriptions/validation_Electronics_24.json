    "description": "The image depicts a common-emitter amplifier circuit using an NPN transistor. The circuit includes several key components and connections:\n\n1. **Power Supplies**: There are two power supplies labeled \\( V_{BB} \\) and \\( V_{CC} \\). \\( V_{BB} \\) is connected to the base of the transistor through resistor \\( R_B \\), and \\( V_{CC} \\) is connected to the collector of the transistor through resistor \\( R_C \\).\n\n2. **Resistors**:\n   - \\( R_B \\): This resistor is connected between the base of the transistor and the \\( V_{BB} \\) supply.\n   - \\( R_C \\): This resistor is connected between the collector of the transistor and the \\( V_{CC} \\) supply.\n   - \\( R_E \\): This resistor is connected between the emitter of the transistor and ground.\n\n3. **Transistor**: An NPN transistor is shown with its base, collector, and emitter terminals clearly marked.\n\n4. **Currents**:\n   - \\( I_B \\): Base current flowing into the base of the transistor.\n   - \\( I_C \\): Collector current flowing out of the collector of the transistor.\n   - \\( I_E \\): Emitter current flowing out of the emitter of the transistor.\n\n5. **Voltages**:\n   - \\( V_{BE} \\): Voltage across the base-emitter junction.\n   - \\( V_{CE} \\): Voltage across the collector-emitter junction.\n\n6. **Signal Source**: A signal source \\( e_s \\) is connected to the base of the transistor through a capacitor, which couples the AC signal to the base while blocking DC.\n\n7. **Ground Connections**: Ground connections are indicated at various points in the circuit.\n\nGiven the numerical values for a germanium transistor:\n- \\( V_{BB} = +15V \\)\n- \\( V_{CC} = +15V \\)\n- \\( V_{BE} = 0.3V \\)\n- \\( R_C = 4k\\Omega \\)\n- \\( R_E = 600\\Omega \\)\n- \\( \\beta = 60 \\)\n\nTo find the value of \\( R_B \\) required to set \\( V_{CE} \\) to 8V, we need to calculate the currents and voltages in the circuit."
