    "question": "The process of spanning trees in <image 1> is a key concept of graph theory. Which diagram illustrates the construction of a breadth-first spanning tree?",
    "options": "['a', 'b']",
    "id": "validation_Math_18",
    "description": "The image consists of two diagrams labeled (a) and (b), each illustrating a sequence of steps in constructing a spanning tree from a given graph. \n\nIn diagram (a):\n- Step 1 shows a graph with several nodes, one of which is highlighted in red.\n- Step 2 shows the same graph with an additional node connected to the red node, also highlighted in red.\n- Step 3 shows further expansion with more nodes connected to the previously highlighted nodes, all highlighted in black.\n- The final output shows a complete spanning tree with all nodes connected, indicating a depth-first search approach.\n\nIn diagram (b):\n- Step 1 shows a graph similar to the initial step in diagram (a).\n- Step 2 shows the same graph with an additional node connected to the red node, also highlighted in red.\n- Step 3 shows further expansion with more nodes connected to the previously highlighted nodes, all highlighted in black.\n- Step 4 shows another node being added to the tree.\n- Step 5 shows another node being added.\n- The final output shows a complete spanning tree with all nodes connected, indicating a breadth-first search approach.\n\nBased on the description, diagram (b) illustrates the construction of a breadth-first spanning tree. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. b"
