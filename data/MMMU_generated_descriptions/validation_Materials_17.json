    "question": "When the hand is holding the 5-lb stone, the humerus H, assumed to be smooth, exerts normal forces F_C and F_A on the radius C and ulna A, respectively, as shown. If the smallest crosssectional area of the ligament at B is 0.30 in^2, determine the greatest average tensile stress to which it is subjected. <image 1>",

    "description": "The image depicts a biomechanical diagram of an arm holding a 5-lb stone. The arm is extended with the elbow joint visible, showing various anatomical structures and forces acting on them. Key elements include:\n\n1. **Humerus (H)**: The upper arm bone.\n2. **Radius (C)** and **Ulna (A)**: The two bones of the forearm.\n3. **Ligament at B**: A connective tissue connecting the bones near the elbow.\n4. **Forces**:\n   - **F_A**: A normal force exerted by the humerus on the ulna, directed downward.\n   - **F_B**: A force exerted by the ligament at B, angled at 75 degrees from the horizontal.\n   - **F_C**: A normal force exerted by the humerus on the radius, directed horizontally.\n5. **Distances**:\n   - The distance from the elbow joint to the point where F_A acts is 0.8 inches.\n   - The distance from the elbow joint to the point where F_C acts is 2 inches.\n   - The distance from the elbow joint to the center of gravity (G) of the stone is 14 inches.\n6. **Stone**: A 5-lb stone held in the hand, with its center of gravity (G) marked.\n\nThe diagram also includes annotations indicating the direction and angles of the forces, specifically noting that F_B is at a 75-degree angle from the horizontal. The smallest cross-sectional area of the ligament at B is given as 0.30 square inches."
