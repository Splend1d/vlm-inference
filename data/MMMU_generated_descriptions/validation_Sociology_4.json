    "description": "The image is titled \"organic solidarity (modern)\" and features a grid of nine circles, each containing a stick figure with various symbols or objects associated with them. The figures represent different groups or individuals, each with their own distinct characteristics:\n\n1. Top left: A figure with an anarchy symbol and a spoon.\n2. Top middle: A figure with a dollar sign and a comb.\n3. Top right: A figure with an Om symbol and a rifle.\n4. Middle left: A figure with a crescent moon and star (Islamic symbol) and a hammer.\n5. Center: A figure with a question mark and a pitchfork.\n6. Middle right: A figure with a Christian cross and a rifle.\n7. Bottom left: A figure with a Star Wars symbol and a wrench.\n8. Bottom middle: A figure with a peace symbol and a pitchfork.\n9. Bottom right: A figure with a hammer and sickle (Communist symbol) and a pitchfork.\n\nAt the bottom of the image, there is a caption that reads \"solidarity from inter-dependence.\"\n\nBased on this description, the shift from mechanical to organic solidarity is likely due to the division of labor, as indicated by the diverse symbols and tools associated with each figure, suggesting specialization and interdependence among different groups or individuals. Therefore, the correct answer to the question would be:\n\nC. Division of labor"
