    "description": "The image shows a table with two columns. The first column is labeled \"x,\" which represents the number of years a new hire will stay with the company. The second column is labeled \"P(x),\" which represents the probability that a new hire will stay with the company for x years. The table lists the following values:\n\n- For x = 0, P(x) = 0.12\n- For x = 1, P(x) = 0.18\n- For x = 2, P(x) = 0.30\n- For x = 3, P(x) = 0.15\n- For x = 4, P(x) = 0.10\n- For x = 5, P(x) = 0.05\n\nThe value for P(x = 4) is 0.10."
