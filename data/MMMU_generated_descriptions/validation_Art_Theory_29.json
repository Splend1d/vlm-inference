    "description": "The image depicts a distinctive modernist building with a unique spiral design. The structure features a continuous ramp that spirals around the interior, allowing visitors to walk from the ground floor to the top without encountering any stairs. The building is surrounded by trees and a few people can be seen sitting or walking near it. The architectural style and the spiral ramp are characteristic of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York City."
