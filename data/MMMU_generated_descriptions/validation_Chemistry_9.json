    "question": "When an unsymmetrical alkene such as propene is treated with N-bromosuccinimide in aqueous dimethyl sulfoxide, the major product has the bromine atom bonded to the less highly substituted carbon atom. Is the following one Markovnikov or non-Markovnikov orientation? <image 1>",

    "description": "The image shows a chemical reaction involving propene (CH\u2083CH=CH\u2082) reacting with bromine (Br\u2082) in the presence of water (H\u2082O). The product of this reaction is 2-bromo-2-propanol (CH\u2083CH(OH)CH\u2082Br). This reaction demonstrates the addition of bromine across the double bond of propene, resulting in the formation of a bromo alcohol."
