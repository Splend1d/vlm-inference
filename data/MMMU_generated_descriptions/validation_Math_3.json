    "description": "The image consists of three graphs labeled Graph 1, Graph 2, and Graph 3. Each graph is represented by a set of vertices (circles) connected by edges (lines).\n\n**Graph 1:**\n- Vertices: \\(a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h\\)\n- Edges: \n  - \\(a-b\\), \\(b-c\\), \\(c-d\\), \\(d-e\\), \\(e-f\\), \\(f-g\\), \\(g-h\\), \\(h-a\\)\n  - \\(a-c\\), \\(a-d\\), \\(a-e\\), \\(a-f\\), \\(a-g\\), \\(a-h\\)\n  - \\(b-d\\), \\(b-f\\), \\(b-h\\)\n  - \\(c-e\\), \\(c-g\\)\n  - \\(d-f\\), \\(d-h\\)\n  - \\(e-g\\)\n\n**Graph 2:**\n- Vertices: \\(a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h\\)\n- Edges:\n  - \\(a-b\\), \\(b-c\\), \\(c-d\\), \\(d-e\\), \\(e-f\\), \\(f-g\\), \\(g-h\\), \\(h-a\\)\n  - \\(a-c\\), \\(a-d\\), \\(a-e\\), \\(a-f\\), \\(a-g\\), \\(a-h\\)\n  - \\(b-d\\), \\(b-f\\), \\(b-h\\)\n  - \\(c-e\\), \\(c-g\\)\n  - \\(d-f\\), \\(d-h\\)\n  - \\(e-g\\)\n\n**Graph 3:**\n- Vertices: \\(a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h\\)\n- Edges:\n  - \\(a-b\\), \\(b-c\\), \\(c-d\\), \\(d-a\\)\n  - \\(a-e\\), \\(b-f\\), \\(c-g\\), \\(d-h\\)\n  - \\(e-f\\), \\(f-g\\), \\(g-h\\), \\(h-e\\)\n\nBased on the descriptions, Graph 1 and Graph 2 appear to have the same structure and connectivity between their vertices, indicating they are isomorphic. Graph 3 has a different structure and connectivity compared to Graphs 1 and 2, indicating it is not isomorphic to them."
