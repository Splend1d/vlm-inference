    "question": "The figure below <image 1> shows a stable structure of a protein that is to be used for each part of this problem. The dashed line divides the structure into three regions labeled A, B, and C in the figure. Does this protein have quaternary structure and how do you reach that conclusion?",

    "description": "The image depicts a molecular structure of a protein, which is divided into three distinct regions labeled A, B, and C by a dashed line. Each region appears to represent a separate subunit or domain of the protein. The structure is shown in a ribbon representation, where the ribbons indicate the secondary structures (alpha helices and beta sheets) of the protein. The overall shape suggests that these subunits are interacting with each other to form a larger, stable complex. This indicates that the protein has quaternary structure, which refers to the arrangement of multiple polypeptide chains (subunits) into a single functional protein unit."
