    "description": "The image shows a close-up view of a person's chest area. The skin appears to be covered with a significant amount of hair. There are several small, dark spots scattered across the chest. These spots vary in size but are generally small and round. A ruler is placed at the bottom of the image, indicating that the spots are relatively small, with some measuring less than a centimeter in diameter. The overall appearance suggests benign skin lesions."
