    "description": "The image shows a sawtooth waveform with the following characteristics:\n\n- The horizontal axis represents time (t), ranging from 0 to 4\u03c0.\n- The vertical axis represents the amplitude, ranging from -\u03c0 to \u03c0.\n- The waveform starts at -\u03c0 at t = 0 and increases linearly to \u03c0 at t = \u03c0.\n- At t = \u03c0, the waveform drops instantaneously back to -\u03c0.\n- This pattern repeats every \u03c0 units of time, creating a periodic sawtooth waveform.\n\nBased on this description, the Fourier series for the sawtooth waveform can be determined by analyzing the given options."
