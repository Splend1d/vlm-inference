    "description": "The image depicts a dramatic scene with three figures. The central figure is a woman wearing a blue dress with gold trim, holding a sword and appearing to be in the act of decapitating a man lying on a bed. The man's head is partially severed, and blood is flowing onto the bed. Another woman, dressed in red and white, is assisting the central figure by holding the man's head steady. The background is dark, which highlights the intense action taking place in the foreground. The painting style features strong contrasts between light and shadow, known as chiaroscuro, and the figures are rendered with realistic detail and emotional intensity."
