    "description": "The image depicts a square loop of wire with a side length of 0.5 meters. The loop is placed in a uniform magnetic field that is directed out of the page. The magnetic field lines are represented by circles with dots inside them, indicating that the field is pointing towards the viewer (out of the page). The intensity of the magnetic field is given as 0.4 tesla. The loop has a resistance of \\(10^{-2}\\) ohms. The problem states that the magnitude of the magnetic field is decreased to zero at a constant rate over a period of 2 seconds."
