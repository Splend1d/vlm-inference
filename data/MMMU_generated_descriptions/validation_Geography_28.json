    "question": "which type of  water in the <image 1> is located on the surfaces of individual soil particles. And this type of water is largely unavailable to plants because it is held firmly by molecular attractions so strong that they can not be broken by plants or through evaporation. ",
    "options": "['Gravitational water', 'Capillary water', 'Hygroscopic water']",

    "description": "The image illustrates three types of water found in soil: gravitational water, capillary water, and hygroscopic water. \n\n1. **Gravitational Water**: This type of water is present when the soil is saturated by rain. Excess water is pulled through the soil by gravity and into groundwater. The diagram shows rain falling onto the soil, with water droplets visibly moving downward through the soil.\n\n2. **Capillary Water**: When excess water is no longer flowing downward, the soil reaches its field capacity. Water held around soil grains by capillary tension is available to plants. The diagram depicts soil at field capacity, with water distributed evenly among the soil particles, allowing plants to access it.\n\n3. **Hygroscopic Water**: After a period without rain, when there is no more available water, the soil reaches its wilting point. Water held by adhesion is not available to plants. The diagram shows soil at the wilting point, with very little water remaining, which is held tightly by the soil particles and is not accessible to plants.\n\nThe image also includes a scale indicating decreasing soil moisture from left to right, with gravitational water having the highest moisture content, followed by capillary water, and then hygroscopic water with the lowest moisture content."
