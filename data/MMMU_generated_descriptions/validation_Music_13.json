    "question": "Which of the following time signatures have standard notation? <image 1>",
    "options": "['BC', 'AD', 'AC', 'AB']",

    "description": "The image shows four musical staffs labeled A, B, C, and D. Each staff has a different time signature at the beginning:\n\n- Staff A has a time signature of 6/8.\n- Staff B has a time signature of 3/4.\n- Staff C has a time signature of 2/4.\n- Staff D has a time signature of 6/8.\n\nThe question asks which of these time signatures have standard notation. Standard notation typically refers to common time signatures used in music. In this context, 3/4 and 2/4 are considered standard time signatures, while 6/8 is also commonly used but might not be considered as \"standard\" in the same way as 3/4 and 2/4.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be:\nA. BC"
