    "description": "The image consists of two pages from a musical score, labeled \"Moderato con anima\" with a tempo marking of \\( \\frac{4}{4} = 100 \\). The score is for an orchestra, featuring various sections including flutes (Flauti), oboes (Oboi), clarinets in A (Clarinetto I, II), bassoons (Fagotti), horns in F (Corni in F), violins I and II (Violini I, II), violas (Viole), cellos (Violoncelli), and double basses (Contrabassi).\n\nIn bar 11A, the third horn (III) and second violins (VI. II) have specific notes that create a harmonic interval. The third horn plays a note that is a major 9th above the note played by the second violins. This interval can also be considered a compound major 2nd, as it exceeds an octave.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to the question is:\n\nB. major 9th/compound major 2nd"
