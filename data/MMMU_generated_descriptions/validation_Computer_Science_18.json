    "description": "The image depicts an adjacency list representation of a directed graph. The vertices are labeled V1 through V7, and the arrows indicate the direction of the edges between the vertices. Here is a detailed description of the adjacency list:\n\n- **V1**: Points to V5.\n- **V2**: Points to V3.\n- **V3**: Points to V5.\n- **V4**: Points to V7.\n- **V5**: Points to V3 and V4.\n- **V6**: Points to V4.\n- **V7**: Points to V6.\n\nStarting from vertex V1 and traversing according to the depth-first search (DFS) method, the obtained vertex sequence is:\n\n1. Start at V1.\n2. Move to V5 (since V1 points to V5).\n3. From V5, move to V3 (since V5 points to V3).\n4. From V3, move to V5 (since V3 points back to V5).\n5. From V5, move to V4 (since V5 also points to V4).\n6. From V4, move to V7 (since V4 points to V7).\n7. From V7, move to V6 (since V7 points to V6).\n8. Finally, move to V2 (since V6 does not point to any other vertex, and V2 has not been visited yet).\n\nTherefore, the correct sequence is: V1, V5, V3, V5, V4, V7, V6, V2."
