    "description": "The image depicts a simple pedigree chart with four individuals represented by circles and squares. The circles represent females, and the squares represent males. There are two horizontal lines connecting the individuals, indicating relationships. \n\n- At the top left, there is a square.\n- Connected to this square is a circle labeled \"A.\"\n- Below the square and circle, there are two more individuals: a circle on the left and a square on the right.\n- The square on the right is connected to another circle at the bottom right.\n- Finally, there is a circle labeled \"B\" at the bottom center, connected to the circle at the bottom right.\n\nThe connections suggest that:\n- The square at the top left is the parent of both the circle labeled \"A\" and the circle on the left below it.\n- The circle on the left below the square is the parent of the circle labeled \"B\" along with the square on the right.\n- The square on the right is also the parent of the circle labeled \"B.\"\n\nBased on this pedigree chart, individual \"A\" and individual \"B\" share a common ancestor (the square at the top left)."
