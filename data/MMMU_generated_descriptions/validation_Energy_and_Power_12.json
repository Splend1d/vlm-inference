    "question": "A 40-ft^3 adiabatic container is initially evacuated. The supply line contains air that is maintained at 150 psia and 90\u00b0F. The valve is opened until the pressure in the container is the same as the pressure in the supply line. Determine the work potential of the air in this container when it is filled. Take T0 = 80\u00b0F.<image 1>",

    "description": "The image depicts a simple setup involving a cylindrical vessel connected to a supply line through a valve. The vessel is labeled \"Vessel\" and is shown in a vertical orientation. The valve is located at the bottom of the vessel, connecting it to the supply line. The supply line is labeled \"Supply line\" and is shown horizontally below the vessel. The valve is depicted as being closed. The overall setup suggests a system where air from the supply line can be introduced into the vessel by opening the valve."
