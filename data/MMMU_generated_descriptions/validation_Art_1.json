The face of the woman is visible, showing her features in detail. Below the portrait, there is an inscription written in Greek letters. The text reads \"\u03a3\u0395\u039c\u0399\u03a9\u039d\u0397 \u0393\u03a1\u0391\u039c\u039c\u0391\u03a4\u0399\u039a\u0397,\" which translates to \"Semion\u0113 Grammatik\u0113.\" This indicates the name and possibly the profession of the woman depicted in the portrait.
