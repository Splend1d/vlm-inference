    "question": "Air flows into a heat engine at ambient conditions of 100 kPa, 300 K, as shown in <image 1>. Energy is supplied as 1200 kJ per kilogram of air from a 1500 K source, and in some part of the process a heat transfer loss of 300 kJ/kg air occurs at 750 K.The air leaves the engine at 100 kPa, 800 K. Find the first- and second-law efficiencies",

    "description": "The image depicts a schematic of a heat engine system. Air enters the heat engine at ambient conditions with a pressure \\( P_0 \\) of 100 kPa and a temperature \\( T_0 \\) of 300 K. The air then undergoes a process within the heat engine where it receives energy \\( q_H \\) from a high-temperature source at \\( T_H = 1500 \\) K. During this process, there is also a heat transfer loss \\( -q_{\\text{loss}} \\) of 300 kJ/kg air occurring at a lower temperature \\( T_M = 750 \\) K. The air exits the heat engine at the same pressure \\( P_0 \\) but at a higher temperature \\( T_2 = 800 \\) K. The work output from the heat engine is denoted by \\( w \\)."
