    "description": "The image depicts a blimp cruising at a speed of 75 miles per hour (mi/hr) through sea-level standard air. A differential pressure transducer is connected between the nose and the side of the blimp, registering a pressure difference of 950 Pascals (Pa). The nose of the blimp is indicated by a dot labeled \"NOSE,\" and the side of the blimp is indicated by another dot labeled \"SIDE.\" The direction of the blimp's movement is shown by an arrow pointing to the left. The sea level is also marked in the image."
