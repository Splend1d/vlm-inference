    "description": "The image shows a table with three columns: \"Sample No.\", \"Moisture Content\", and \"Bulk Density (g/cc)\". The table lists five samples of soil with their corresponding moisture content and bulk density values:\n\n1. Sample No. 1 has a Moisture Content of 4.8 and a Bulk Density of 2.164 g/cc.\n2. Sample No. 2 has a Moisture Content of 7.5 and a Bulk Density of 2.322 g/cc.\n3. Sample No. 3 has a Moisture Content of 7.8 and a Bulk Density of 2.351 g/cc.\n4. Sample No. 4 has a Moisture Content of 8.9 and a Bulk Density of 2.345 g/cc.\n5. Sample No. 5 has a Moisture Content of 9.7 and a Bulk Density of 2.327 g/cc.\n\nBased on this information, the optimum moisture content can be determined by identifying the sample with the highest bulk density, which corresponds to the most compacted state of the soil."
