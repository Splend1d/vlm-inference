    "question": "<image 1>A student performs the photoelectric effect experiment and obtains the data depicted in the accompanying graph of E_{km} (maximum kinetic energy) of photoelectrons v. the frequency of the photons. What is the approximate work function of this material?",
    "options": "['1.5 eV', '2.0 eV', '2.7 eV', '3.5 eV']",
    "id": "validation_Physics_20",
    "description": "The image shows a graph with two axes: the x-axis represents the frequency of photons (f) in units of \\(10^{14}\\) Hz, and the y-axis represents the maximum kinetic energy (\\(E_{km}\\)) of photoelectrons in electron volts (eV). The graph displays a straight line that starts at a negative value on the y-axis and increases linearly as the frequency increases. The line intersects the x-axis at approximately \\(4 \\times 10^{14}\\) Hz. This intersection point indicates the threshold frequency at which the photoelectric effect begins to occur for the given material."
