    "description": "The image shows a table with two columns: \"Speed (km/h)\" and \"Density (veh/km).\" The table lists six pairs of values:\n\n1. Speed: 14.2 km/h, Density: 85 veh/km\n2. Speed: 24.1 km/h, Density: 70 veh/km\n3. Speed: 30.3 km/h, Density: 55 veh/km\n4. Speed: 40.1 km/h, Density: 41 veh/km\n5. Speed: 50.6 km/h, Density: 20 veh/km\n6. Speed: 55.0 km/h, Density: 15 veh/km\n\nThese data points are used for regression analysis to fit the data to the Greenshields model and determine the capacity."
