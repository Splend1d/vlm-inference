    "description": "The image is a velocity-time graph for an object moving in a straight line. The x-axis represents time in seconds (s), ranging from 0 to 4 seconds. The y-axis represents velocity in meters per second (m/s), ranging from -2 m/s to 2 m/s.\n\nThe graph consists of several segments:\n1. From 0 to 1 second, the velocity decreases linearly from 0 m/s to -2 m/s.\n2. From 1 to 2 seconds, the velocity increases linearly from -2 m/s back to 0 m/s.\n3. From 2 to 3 seconds, the velocity remains constant at 0 m/s.\n4. From 3 to 4 seconds, the velocity increases linearly from 0 m/s to 2 m/s.\n\nThe area under the curve represents the displacement of the object. The object passes through its initial position when the total displacement returns to zero."
