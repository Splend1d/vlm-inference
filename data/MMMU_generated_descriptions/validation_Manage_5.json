    "question": "<image 1> is The process of divergence and convergence, the divergence-convergence process is sequential, divergence precedes convergence, as shown in the figure. You first unfold like a fruiting tree, and then some of the broad changes you produce converge on new, innovative products. Note that many divergent ideas end up going nowhere, so what do critics complain about?",
    "options": "['No need to diverge', 'Disagreement is wasteful and self-indulgent', 'Convergence proceeds too slowly', 'The process of divergence-convergence is of little significance.']",

    "description": "The image is labeled \"Figure 2.16 The process of divergence and convergence.\" It depicts a stylized drawing of a human head with a brain divided into two halves. The left side of the brain is labeled \"CREATIVITY\" and \"DIVERGENT,\" while the right side is labeled \"CONVERGENT\" and \"Science Stereotype.\" The left side shows a branching pattern, symbolizing the divergent thinking process, where multiple ideas are generated. The right side shows a converging pattern, symbolizing the convergent thinking process, where ideas are narrowed down to a single solution or product. The image illustrates the sequential nature of the divergence-convergence process, where divergence (generating multiple ideas) precedes convergence (narrowing down to a specific outcome)."
