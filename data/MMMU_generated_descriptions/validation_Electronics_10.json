    "description": "The image depicts an electrical circuit diagram labeled \"Fig. 1.\" The circuit consists of a voltage source, two resistors, a capacitor, and an inductor arranged in parallel. Here are the details:\n\n1. **Voltage Source**: The voltage source is represented by a sine wave symbol with the expression \\( 100 \\cos(377t) \\) volts.\n2. **Resistors**: There are two resistors, each with a resistance of 100 ohms (\\(\\Omega\\)).\n3. **Capacitor**: There is a capacitor with a capacitance of 10 microfarads (\\(\\mu F\\)).\n4. **Inductor**: There is an inductor with an inductance of 1 henry (H).\n5. **Currents**: Two currents are indicated in the circuit:\n   - \\( I_1 \\): This current flows through the resistor and the capacitor branch.\n   - \\( I_2 \\): This current flows through the resistor and the inductor branch.\n6. **Nodes**: The circuit has two main nodes labeled 'a' and 'b'.\n\nThe question asks to calculate the current \\( I_1 \\) in terms of amperes (A) and provide the answer as a complex number."
