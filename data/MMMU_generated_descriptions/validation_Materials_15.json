    "question": "Following are tabulated data that were gathered from a series of Charpy impact tests on a ductile cast iron. <image 1> Determine a ductile-to-brittle transition temperature as that temperature corresponding to the average of the maximum and minimum impact energies.",
    "options": "['-100$^\\\\circ$C', '-110$^\\\\circ$C', '-105$^\\\\circ$C', '-125$^\\\\circ$C']",

    "description": "The image shows a table with two columns: Temperature (in degrees Celsius) and Impact Energy (in Joules). The temperatures range from -25\u00b0C to -175\u00b0C, and the corresponding impact energies range from 124 J to 6 J. The data points are as follows:\n\n- At -25\u00b0C, the impact energy is 124 J.\n- At -50\u00b0C, the impact energy is 123 J.\n- At -75\u00b0C, the impact energy is 115 J.\n- At -85\u00b0C, the impact energy is 100 J.\n- At -100\u00b0C, the impact energy is 73 J.\n- At -110\u00b0C, the impact energy is 52 J.\n- At -125\u00b0C, the impact energy is 26 J.\n- At -150\u00b0C, the impact energy is 9 J.\n- At -175\u00b0C, the impact energy is 6 J.\n\nThe table indicates a decrease in impact energy as the temperature decreases, suggesting a transition from ductile to brittle behavior."
