    "description": "The image is a graph labeled \"Graph 1\" that illustrates the relationship between aggregate demand (consumption, denoted as C) and output or income (denoted as Y). The x-axis represents output or income (Y), ranging from 0 to 50, while the y-axis represents aggregate demand or consumption (C), ranging from 0 to 40.\n\nThe graph shows a straight line labeled \"C\" that starts at the point (0, 10) and extends upward and to the right, passing through the point (50, 40). This line represents the consumption function, which indicates how consumption changes with respect to income.\n\nThe slope of the line is positive, indicating that as income increases, consumption also increases. The line has a constant slope, suggesting a linear relationship between consumption and income."
