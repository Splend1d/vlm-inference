    "description": "The image depicts a chemical reaction in the glycolytic pathway. The reactants are glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and water (H\u2082O), and the products are 3-phosphoglycerate, NADH, and H\u207a. The reaction involves the conversion of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate to 3-phosphoglycerate, with the reduction of NAD\u207a to NADH and the release of a hydrogen ion (H\u207a). This step is typically catalyzed by the enzyme glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase."
