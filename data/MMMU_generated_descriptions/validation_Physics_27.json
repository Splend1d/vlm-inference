    "question": "In the circuit shown below, each of the resistors has the same resistance.<image 1>A voltmeter with very high resistance is connected between two points in the circuit.Between which two points of connection would the voltmeter read zero?",
    "options": "['Q and U', 'P and T', 'Q and W', 'S and U']",
    "id": "validation_Physics_27",
    "description": "The image depicts an electrical circuit consisting of six resistors arranged in a series-parallel configuration. The resistors are labeled from left to right as follows: the first resistor is connected between points T and S, the second resistor is between points S and Q, the third resistor is between points Q and P, the fourth resistor is between points W and U, the fifth resistor is between points U and the point where the fourth resistor ends, and the sixth resistor is between this point and point P. A battery is connected between points T and P, completing the circuit. Each resistor has the same resistance."
