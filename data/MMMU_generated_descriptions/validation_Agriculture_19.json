    "description": "The image shows three green chive stems with numerous small, raised pustules. The pustules are primarily orange but also have some black spots interspersed among them. The background appears to be a rough, textured surface, possibly soil or bark. The orange pustules are more prominent and cover a larger area of the stems, while the black spots are smaller and scattered."
