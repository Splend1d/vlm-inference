    "question": "A 23-year-old G2 P1 woman has noted minimal fetal movement in the second trimester. An ultrasound scan at 19 weeks shows hydrops fetalis. A girl infant is born at 32 weeks gestation and is markedly icteric. The microscopic appearance of the placenta is shown here. Laboratory studies show the baby has a Hct of 18%, and an exchange transfusion is performed. Her first pregnancy was uncomplicated and resulted in the birth of a normal girl at term. Which of the following immunologic mechanisms is most likely to produce these findings? <image 1> ",
    "options": "['Anti-receptor antibody', 'Immune complex formation', 'Complement mediated cell destruction', 'Delayed type hypersensitivity', 'Loss of self tolerance']",

    "description": "The image shows a histological section of tissue under a microscope. The tissue appears to have a dense network of cells with a characteristic purple staining, which is typical for hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining used in histology. The cells are tightly packed and exhibit a somewhat irregular arrangement, with some areas showing more densely stained nuclei and others showing lighter staining. The overall appearance suggests a pathological condition affecting the tissue, possibly related to inflammation or immune-mediated damage."
