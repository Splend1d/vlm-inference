    "description": "The image is a pedigree chart that illustrates the genetic inheritance pattern of a trait within a family. The chart includes symbols representing different individuals and their relationships:\n\n- Circles represent females.\n- Squares represent males.\n- Solid black symbols indicate individuals who are afflicted with the trait.\n- Open symbols (white circles or squares) indicate individuals who are normal (not afflicted).\n- Symbols with diagonal lines indicate carriers of the trait.\n\nThe chart shows three generations of individuals, numbered from 1 to 9. The relationships are indicated by horizontal lines connecting spouses and vertical lines connecting parents to their offspring.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the individuals:\n- Individual 1 (female) is a carrier.\n- Individual 2 (male) is afflicted.\n- Individual 3 (male) is afflicted.\n- Individual 4 (female) is a carrier.\n- Individual 5 (female) is normal.\n- Individual 6 (male) is afflicted.\n- Individual 7 (male) is normal.\n- Individual 8 (female) is a carrier.\n- Individual 9 (male) is normal.\n\nBased on this information, the pedigree chart shows a pattern where the trait is passed from an affected male to his daughters, who become carriers, and from a carrier female to her sons, who may become afflicted. This pattern is consistent with X-linked recessive inheritance, which is the mode of inheritance for colorblindness."
