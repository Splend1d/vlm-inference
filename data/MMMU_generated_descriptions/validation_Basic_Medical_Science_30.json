    "description": "The image depicts a model or illustration of the human brain with its major blood vessels highlighted. The middle cerebral artery (MCA) is prominently shown in red, branching out to supply various regions of the brain. The MCA is one of the three main branches of the internal carotid artery and is responsible for supplying blood to a large portion of the lateral surface of the brain, including areas involved in speech in the majority of people. The left side of the brain, which is typically dominant for language functions in most individuals, is clearly visible in the image, with the left middle cerebral artery branching extensively to serve these areas."
