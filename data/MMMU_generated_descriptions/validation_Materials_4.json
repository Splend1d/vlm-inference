    "description": "The image depicts a mechanical engineering diagram of a bent rod structure. The rod is bent in an L-shape and is supported at point D, which is fixed to a support. The rod has a horizontal section extending from point A to point E, where a force P is applied vertically downward through a chain attached to point E. The distance from point A to point E along the horizontal section is 600 mm.\n\nAt section a-a, the cross-sectional dimensions of the rod are shown. The cross-section is rectangular with a width of 25 mm and a height of 50 mm. The thickness of the rod at this section is 20 mm.\n\nPoint B is located at the inner corner of the bend, where the horizontal and vertical sections of the rod meet. The distance from point A to point B along the vertical section is 300 mm.\n\nGiven that the force P is 3 kN, the task is to determine the bending stress developed at point B of the cross section at section a-a."
