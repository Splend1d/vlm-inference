    "description": "The image depicts a leftist heap, which is a type of binary tree used in computer science for efficient priority queue operations. The nodes in the tree contain numerical values, and the structure follows specific rules to maintain its properties.\n\nHere is a detailed description of the tree:\n\n- The root node contains the value 6.\n- The left child of the root (6) is 13, and the right child is 8.\n- The left child of 13 is 18, and the right child is 24.\n- The left child of 24 is 35, and the right child is 26.\n- The left child of 8 is 12, and the right child is 37.\n- The left child of 12 is 17, and the right child is 19.\n\nTo answer the question about deleting the minimum number from the leftist heap:\n\n1. The minimum number in the heap is 6, which is the root.\n2. After deleting the root (6), the next smallest element becomes the new root. In this case, the next smallest element is 8.\n\nNow, let's analyze each statement:\n\nA. **8 is NOT the root**: This statement is false because after deleting the minimum number (6), 8 becomes the new root.\n\nB. **12 is the right child of 8**: This statement is true because 12 is indeed the right child of 8.\n\nC. **24 is the left child of 13**: This statement is true because 24 is the left child of 13.\n\nD. **35 is the right child of 24**: This statement is false because 35 is actually the left child of 24, not the right child.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is:\n\n**B. 12 is the right child of 8**"
