    "description": "The image depicts a grid with a series of numbered nodes connected by lines, representing a line coverage data structure. The grid is labeled with coordinates ranging from (0,0) at the bottom left to (10,10) at the top right. The nodes are numbered from 11 to 16. Node 12 is located at the intersection of two lines, one vertical and one diagonal. The vertical line connects nodes 11 and 12, while the diagonal line connects nodes 12 and 15. Therefore, there are two arcs connecting at node 12."
