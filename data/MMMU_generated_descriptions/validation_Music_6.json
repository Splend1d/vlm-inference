    "question": "<image 1> The second measure of the above example uses which rhythmic device?",
    "options": "['Anacrusis', 'Hemiola', 'Suspension', 'Augmentation']",
    "id": "validation_Music_6",
    "description": "The image shows a musical score with two measures of music written in treble and bass clefs. The time signature is 6/8 for both clefs. In the second measure, there is a rhythmic pattern where the notes are grouped in a way that creates a hemiola effect. Specifically, the notes in the second measure are grouped in sets of three eighth notes, which contrasts with the expected grouping of two groups of three eighth notes per measure in 6/8 time. This rhythmic grouping creates a syncopated feel and emphasizes the hemiola rhythm."
