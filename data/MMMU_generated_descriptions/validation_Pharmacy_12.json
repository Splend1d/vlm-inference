    "description": "The image depicts an experimental setup involving the decomposition of ammonium carbonate \\((\\mathrm{NH}_{4})_{2} \\mathrm{CO}_{3}\\). The setup includes a burner at the bottom, which is used to heat the ammonium carbonate. The ammonium carbonate is placed in a container that is connected to glass tubing through rubber tubing. The glass tubing leads to a test tube containing limewater \\(\\left(\\mathrm{Ca}(\\mathrm{OH})_{2}(aq)\\right)\\).\n\nThe purpose of this experiment is to demonstrate the decomposition of ammonium carbonate upon heating, which produces water \\(\\left(\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}\\right)\\), carbon dioxide \\(\\left(\\mathrm{CO}_{2}\\right)\\), and ammonia \\(\\left(\\mathrm{NH}_{3}\\right)\\). The limewater is used to detect the presence of carbon dioxide, as it will turn milky when carbon dioxide is bubbled through it due to the formation of calcium carbonate \\(\\left(\\mathrm{CaCO}_{3}\\right)\\).\n\nBased on the setup and the chemical reaction involved, the balanced equation for the reaction is:\n\n\\[\n(\\mathrm{NH}_{4})_{2} \\mathrm{CO}_{3} \\rightarrow \\Delta \\rightarrow \\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O} + \\mathrm{CO}_{2} + 2 \\mathrm{NH}_{3}\n\\]\n\nThis equation correctly represents the decomposition of ammonium carbonate into water, carbon dioxide, and ammonia upon heating."
