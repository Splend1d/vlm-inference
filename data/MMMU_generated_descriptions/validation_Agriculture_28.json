    "options": "['It will grow down into the roots and kill the tree.', 'Mistletoe is beneficial and increases the growth of the plant.', 'It just uses the tree for support and does not damage it.', \"I don't know and don't want to guess.\", 'It has a very damaging impact on the health of the plant but localised to the place of infection.']",

    "description": "The image depicts a tree with bare branches against a light sky background. There are several clusters of green, leafy growths attached to the branches at various points. These growths appear to be parasitic plants, likely mistletoe, which are photosynthesizing and thriving despite the tree's lack of foliage. The mistletoe clusters are distributed unevenly across the tree, with some branches showing more significant infestations than others. The overall appearance suggests that the mistletoe is having a localized impact on the tree's health, as the affected areas have more pronounced growths compared to the rest of the tree."
