    "description": "The image depicts three figures seated around a table, each adorned with halos and draped in flowing robes of various colors, including blue, green, and red. The figures appear to be engaged in conversation or contemplation, with one figure in the center slightly elevated compared to the other two. The background features a simple landscape with a tree and a structure that resembles a building or a tower. The overall style of the painting is characterized by its use of gold leaf and a somewhat flat, two-dimensional perspective, typical of religious iconography. The figures have wings, suggesting they are angels or divine beings. The scene is serene and focused on the interaction among the figures, rather than on realistic depiction or naturalistic details."
