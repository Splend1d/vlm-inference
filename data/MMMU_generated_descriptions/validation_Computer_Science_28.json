    "question": "Suppose you are given the below data, and you want to apply a logistic regression model for classifying it into two given classes.<image 1>You are using logistic regression with L1 regularization.<image 2>Where C is the regularization parameter, and w1 & w2 are the coefficients of x1 and x2.Which of the following option is correct when you increase the value of C from zero to a very large value?",
    "options": "['First, w2 becomes zero, and then w1 becomes zero', 'First, w1 becomes zero, and then w2 becomes zero', 'Both become zero at the same time', 'Both cannot be zero even after a very large value of C']",

    "description": "The first image shows two scatter plots of data points in a two-dimensional space, labeled \\( x_1 \\) and \\( x_2 \\). The top plot has two distinct clusters of data points: one cluster marked with circles (\u25cb) and another cluster marked with plus signs (+). The bottom plot is identical to the top plot, showing the same distribution of data points.\n\nThe second image presents a mathematical expression related to logistic regression with L1 regularization. The expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\log P(y_i | x_i, w_0, w_1, w_2) - C(|w_1| + |w_2|)\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( n \\) is the number of data points.\n- \\( P(y_i | x_i, w_0, w_1, w_2) \\) represents the probability of the target variable \\( y_i \\) given the input features \\( x_i \\) and the weights \\( w_0, w_1, w_2 \\).\n- \\( C \\) is the regularization parameter.\n- \\( |w_1| \\) and \\( |w_2| \\) are the absolute values of the coefficients \\( w_1 \\) and \\( w_2 \\), respectively.\n\nThis expression indicates that the logistic regression model is penalized by the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients \\( w_1 \\) and \\( w_2 \\), scaled by the regularization parameter \\( C \\)."
