    "description": "The image depicts a developing embryo with a distinct pattern of segmentation. The embryo appears to be organized into a series of repeating units, which are likely somites, indicating that segmentation is well-established. The embryo also shows a clear head-to-tail orientation, with one end appearing more developed than the other, suggesting the establishment of anterior-posterior polarity. However, there is no visible indication of limb placement or the specific type of symmetry (e.g., bilateral or radial) at this stage. The image does not provide enough detail to determine the presence of limbs or the exact type of symmetry. Therefore, the features that are clearly established in this developing embryo are segmentation and head-tail orientation."
