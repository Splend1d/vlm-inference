    "description": "The image shows a close-up view of a brain with a highly inflamed and swollen appearance. The surface of the brain exhibits significant edema, characterized by a puffy and swollen texture. The gyri (ridges) and sulci (grooves) are less distinct than normal, indicating increased pressure within the brain. The overall color of the brain tissue appears reddish-brown, suggesting inflammation or hemorrhage. The presence of prominent blood vessels on the surface further indicates vascular involvement in the pathological process. This appearance is consistent with conditions such as meningitis or encephalitis, which can cause severe inflammation and swelling of the brain tissues."
