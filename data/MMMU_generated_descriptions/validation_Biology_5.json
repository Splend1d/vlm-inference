    "description": "The image depicts a bacteriophage, which is a type of virus that infects bacteria. The bacteriophage has several distinct parts labeled A, B, C, and D. \n\n- Part A is the head of the bacteriophage, which is a hexagonal structure.\n- Part B is located inside the head and appears to be a coiled, thread-like structure.\n- Part C is the tail of the bacteriophage, which is a long, hollow tube with a sheath surrounding it.\n- Part D consists of several tail fibers that extend from the base of the tail.\n\nBased on this description, part B in the figure is the viral genome."
