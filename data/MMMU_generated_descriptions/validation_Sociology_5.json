On the left side, there is a child named Jim with an IQ of 150. He is standing on top of a stack of resources labeled \"Enrichment Programmes,\" \"ISO-Certified Tutors,\" \"Best Books $ Can Buy,\" and \"Latest IT Tools.\" There are two adults cheering him on, one saying \"Go Junior, Go!\" and the other saying \"Go, Sir!\" Additionally, there is a speech bubble from Jim saying \"Stop making excuses. You're just not working hard enough!\"\n\nOn the right side, there is another child named Seng with an IQ of 150. Seng is standing on a single box labeled \"Basic Education.\" There is an adult next to Seng who is saying \"Later after school make sure come home take care of ah girl, ah!\"\n\nAbove both scenes, there is a large carrot labeled \"SUCCESS\" hanging from a string, symbolizing the goal or reward for both children.\n\nThe cartoon highlights the disparity in educational resources and expectations between two children with similar abilities, suggesting that one child has significantly more support and encouragement than the other."
