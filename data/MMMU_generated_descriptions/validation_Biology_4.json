    "options": "['autosomal recessive (AR)', 'autosomal dominant (AD)', 'X-linked recessive (XR)', 'X-linked dominant (XD)']",

    "description": "The image depicts a pedigree chart with multiple generations. The symbols used are circles for females and squares for males. Filled symbols represent individuals affected by a particular trait or condition, while unfilled symbols represent unaffected individuals.\n\n- The top generation shows one affected female (filled circle) and one unaffected male (unfilled square).\n- The second generation includes several offspring from the first generation's marriage. There are both affected and unaffected individuals among them.\n- The third generation shows further descendants, with a mix of affected and unaffected individuals.\n\nBased on this description, the most likely mode of inheritance can be determined by analyzing the pattern of affected individuals across generations."
