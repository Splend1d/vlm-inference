    "description": "The image is a table that summarizes the results of two screening methods for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN I-III): electronic colposcopy and cervical liquid-based cytology (TCT). The table is divided into four main columns: \"Test results,\" \"Patients with cervical lesions,\" and \"Patients with non-cervical lesions.\" Each column has further sub-columns for the specific test results.\n\nHere is the detailed breakdown of the table:\n\n### Test Results:\n- **Electronic Colposcopy**:\n  - Positive (+)\n  - Negative (-)\n\n- **TCT**:\n  - Positive (+)\n  - Negative (-)\n\n### Patients with Cervical Lesions:\n- **+ (Positive)**:\n  - Electronic Colposcopy: 15\n  - TCT: 5\n  - Both: 70\n  - Neither: 10\n\n### Patients with Non-Cervical Lesions:\n- **+ (Positive)**:\n  - Electronic Colposcopy: 10\n  - TCT: 220\n  - Both: 25\n  - Neither: 245\n\n### Total:\n- **Patients with Cervical Lesions**: 100\n- **Patients with Non-Cervical Lesions**: 500\n\nThe table provides a comprehensive summary of the test results for both screening methods across patients with and without cervical lesions."
