    "question": "A student placed 20 tobacco seeds of the same species on moist paper towels in each of two petri dishes. Dish A was wrapped completely in an opaque cover to exclude all light. Dish B was not wrapped. The dishes were placed equidistant from a light source set to a cycle of 14 h of light and 10 h of dark. All other conditions were the same for both dishes. The dishes were examined after seven days, and the opaque cover was permanently removed from dish A. Both dishes were returned to the light and examined again at 14 days. The following data were obtained: <image 1> What best describes the usefulness of the yellow-leaved phenotype as a variation subject to natural selection?",
    "options": "['The yellow-leaved phenotype can germinate in environments without light.', 'The germination of the yellow-leaved phenotype is unaffected by light intensity.', 'The germination of the yellow-leaved phenotype is accelerated as compared to the green-leaved phenotype.', 'The yellow-leaved phenotype cannot germinate in environments with light.']",

    "description": "The image consists of two tables, labeled \"Dish A\" and \"Dish B,\" which present data on the growth of tobacco seeds under different conditions over a period of 14 days. \n\n### Dish A:\n- **Day 7 (covered)**:\n  - Germinated seeds: 12\n  - Green-leaved seedlings: 0\n  - Yellow-leaved seedlings: 12\n  - Mean stem length below first set of leaves: 8 mm\n\n- **Day 14 (uncovered)**:\n  - Germinated seeds: 20\n  - Green-leaved seedlings: 14\n  - Yellow-leaved seedlings: 6\n  - Mean stem length below first set of leaves: 9 mm\n\n### Dish B:\n- **Day 7 (uncovered)**:\n  - Germinated seeds: 20\n  - Green-leaved seedlings: 15\n  - Yellow-leaved seedlings: 5\n  - Mean stem length below first set of leaves: 3 mm\n\n- **Day 14 (covered)**:\n  - Germinated seeds: 20\n  - Green-leaved seedlings: 15\n  - Yellow-leaved seedlings: 5\n  - Mean stem length below first set of leaves: 3 mm\n\nBoth dishes contained 20 tobacco seeds initially. Dish A was covered to exclude light for the first 7 days, while Dish B was uncovered. After 7 days, the cover was removed from Dish A, and both dishes were returned to the light source. The data show changes in germination rates, leaf color, and stem length over time."
