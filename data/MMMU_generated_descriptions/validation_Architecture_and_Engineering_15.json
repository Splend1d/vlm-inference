    "description": "The image depicts a three-hinged parabolic arch labeled ABC, with supports at points A and C and a hinge at point B. The arch is symmetric about the vertical axis passing through point B. The dimensions provided are:\n\n- The span length \\( L \\) between points A and C is 175 feet.\n- The height \\( h \\) of the arch at point B is 150 feet.\n- The height at point D, which is halfway between points B and C, is 100 feet.\n\nThe equation for the parabolic arch is given by \\( y = \\frac{4hx^2}{L^2} \\).\n\nA point load \\( P \\) is applied vertically downward at point B. The task is to construct the influence lines for the reactions at point C and the shear, axial load, and moment at point D. Additionally, it is required to compute the shear load at point D when a point load \\( P = 3 \\) kips is applied at point B.\n\nThe options for the shear load at point D are:\nA. -1.84k compr\nB. -1.94k compr\nC. -1.74k compr"
