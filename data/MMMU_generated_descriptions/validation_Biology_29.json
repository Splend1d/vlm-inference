    "description": "The image consists of five different chemical structures labeled A through E. Each structure represents a disaccharide, which is a type of carbohydrate composed of two monosaccharides linked together.\n\n- **Structure A**: This structure shows a disaccharide with two glucose molecules linked by an alpha-1,4-glycosidic bond. The glucose units are in a pyranose ring form, with hydroxyl (OH) groups attached at various positions.\n  \n- **Structure B**: This structure also shows a disaccharide with two glucose molecules linked by an alpha-1,4-glycosidic bond. The glucose units are in a pyranose ring form, similar to Structure A, but the orientation of the hydroxyl groups differs slightly.\n\n- **Structure C**: This structure depicts a disaccharide with two glucose molecules linked by a beta-1,4-glycosidic bond. The glucose units are in a pyranose ring form, with hydroxyl groups attached at various positions.\n\n- **Structure D**: This structure shows a disaccharide with two fructose molecules linked by a beta-2,1-glycosidic bond. The fructose units are in a furanose ring form, with hydroxymethyl (CH2OH) groups attached.\n\n- **Structure E**: This structure depicts a disaccharide with two galactose molecules linked by a beta-1,4-glycosidic bond. The galactose units are in a pyranose ring form, with hydroxyl groups attached at various positions.\n\nBased on this description, the primary disaccharide digestion product of starch is maltose, which is represented by Structure A or Structure B."
