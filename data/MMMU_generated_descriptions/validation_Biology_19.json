    "description": "The image depicts the stages of a bacteriophage infection process. Here is a detailed description:\n\n1. **Stage A**: This stage shows a host bacterial cell with its DNA (host DNA) inside. Outside the cell, there is a bacteriophage with its phage DNA.\n2. **Stage B**: The bacteriophage has attached to the host bacterial cell, and its phage DNA has been injected into the host cell. The host DNA is still visible inside the cell.\n3. **Stage C**: Inside the host bacterial cell, the phage DNA has replicated multiple times, indicating the biosynthesis phase where new phage components are being produced.\n4. **Stage D**: New bacteriophages have formed within the host bacterial cell, consisting of both the capsid and the phage DNA.\n5. **Stage E**: The newly formed bacteriophages exit the host bacterial cell, which appears to be lysed or broken open.\n\nBased on this description, the stage marked C in the figure corresponds to the biosynthesis phase of the bacteriophage infection process. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is:\n\nC. Biosynthesis"
