    "description": "The image depicts an anatomical structure labeled \"MACULA.\" The structure appears to be part of the inner ear, specifically the vestibular system. It is shown in a cross-sectional view, with various components highlighted in different colors. The surrounding area includes what looks like fluid-filled chambers, suggesting that this structure is located within a fluid environment. The overall appearance suggests that it is involved in sensing or detecting certain types of movement or orientation."
