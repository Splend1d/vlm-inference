    "description": "The image is a table labeled \"Table 3.12\" which shows data on how musicians learned to play their instruments, categorized by gender. The table has five columns: Gender, Self-taught, Studied in school, Private instruction, and Total. The rows are divided into Female and Male categories. \n\nHere are the details from the table:\n\n- **Female**:\n  - Self-taught: 12\n  - Studied in school: 38\n  - Private instruction: 22\n  - Total: 72\n\n- **Male**:\n  - Self-taught: 19\n  - Studied in school: 24\n  - Private instruction: 15\n  - Total: 58\n\n- **Total** (combined across genders):\n  - Self-taught: 31\n  - Studied in school: 62\n  - Private instruction: 37\n  - Total: 130\n\nThe question asks for the probability that a musician is female. To find this, we need to divide the total number of female musicians (72) by the overall total number of musicians (130).\n\n\\[ P(\\text{musician is a female}) = \\frac{72}{130} \\]\n\nCalculating this gives:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{musician is a female}) = 0.5538 \\approx 0.55 \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. 0.55."
