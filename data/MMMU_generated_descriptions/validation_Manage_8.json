    "description": "The image is a line graph titled \"Number Unemployed, by Level of Education.\" It shows the number of unemployed workers (in thousands) over a five-month period from June to October, categorized by different levels of education completed. The x-axis represents the months (June, July, August, September, and October), and the y-axis represents the number of unemployed workers (in thousands).\n\nThere are four lines representing different education levels:\n1. Less than a high school diploma (diamond-shaped markers)\n2. High school diploma, no college (square-shaped markers)\n3. Some college (triangle-shaped markers)\n4. Bachelor's degree and higher (circle-shaped markers)\n\nEach line has data points for each month, showing the number of unemployed workers for that specific education level. The lines fluctuate slightly across the months, indicating changes in unemployment numbers.\n\nTo determine the difference between the number of unemployed high school graduates and the number of unemployed workers without a high school diploma, we need to compare the values at each month for these two categories."
