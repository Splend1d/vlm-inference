    "description": "The image consists of two sets of shapes. The top row shows two shapes: one with a slanted line on the left side and another with an L-shaped outline. The bottom row has four labeled shapes (a), (b), (c), and (d). Each of these shapes is composed of smaller rectangles arranged in different configurations within a larger rectangle.\n\n- Shape (a) has three smaller rectangles arranged in a way that one is on the left side, one is on the right side, and one is at the bottom.\n- Shape (b) has three smaller rectangles arranged in a way that one is on the left side, one is on the right side, and one is at the bottom, similar to shape (a).\n- Shape (c) has three smaller rectangles arranged in a way that one is on the left side, one is on the right side, and one is at the bottom, similar to shapes (a) and (b).\n- Shape (d) has three smaller rectangles arranged in a way that one is on the left side, one is on the right side, and one is at the bottom, similar to shapes (a), (b), and (c).\n\nGiven this information, the correct left view would be the shape that matches the arrangement of the smaller rectangles when viewed from the left side."
