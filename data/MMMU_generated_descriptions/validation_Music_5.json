    "description": "The image shows a musical staff with a treble clef at the beginning. On the staff, there is a single note located on the second line from the bottom. To the right of the staff, there is a statement: \"This is the supertonic in G\u266d major.\" Below this statement, there are two options labeled \"TRUE\" and \"FALSE.\"\n\nTo determine whether the statement is true or false, we need to identify the note on the staff and compare it to the supertonic (second degree) of the G\u266d major scale. The note on the staff is an A\u266d. In the G\u266d major scale, the supertonic is indeed A\u266d. Therefore, the statement is true."
