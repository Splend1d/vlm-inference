    "description": "The image depicts a sculpture of two figures reclining on a bed-like structure. The figures appear to be dressed in ancient attire, with one figure having long hair and the other wearing a headpiece. The sculpture is made of a reddish-brown material and shows signs of age, with some wear and discoloration. The overall style and subject matter suggest that this is an ancient funerary sculpture, likely from the Etruscan or early Roman period."
