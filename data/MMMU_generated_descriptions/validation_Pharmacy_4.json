    "question": "The mass of the elements iron and oxygen in four samples of a rustcolored substance was measured in grams (g). The amount of iron and oxygen in each sample is shown on the graph. <image 1>, Determine if the following content is correct based on the image and text:All four samples are the same compound.",

    "description": "The image shows a graph titled \"Mass of Elements in Samples.\" The x-axis represents the mass of oxygen in grams (g), ranging from 0 to 8 g. The y-axis represents the mass of iron in grams (g), ranging from 0 to 20 g. There are four data points plotted on the graph, each representing a different sample of a rust-colored substance. The data points are connected by a straight line, indicating a linear relationship between the mass of iron and the mass of oxygen in the samples.\n\nAdditionally, there is a mathematical expression provided below the graph:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{g iron}}{\\text{g oxygen}} = \\frac{5 \\text{ g iron}}{2.25 \\text{ g oxygen}} \\approx \\frac{2.3 \\text{ g iron}}{\\text{g oxygen}}\n\\]\n\nThis expression suggests a ratio between the mass of iron and the mass of oxygen in the samples."
