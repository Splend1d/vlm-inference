    "description": "The image is a detailed anatomical illustration of a cross-section of the knee joint. The various structures within the knee are labeled with numbers. Specifically, structure 164 is located in the central region of the knee, near the top of the image. This structure appears to be a band-like feature that connects two other structures within the knee joint. Based on its position and appearance, it is likely a ligament."
