    "description": "The image shows a square five-pile cap with the following dimensions and details:\n\n- The overall dimensions of the pile cap are 1500mm x 1500mm.\n- The cushion cap thickness is 1200mm.\n- The effective height \\( h_0 \\) is 1050mm.\n- The pile section size is 400mm x 400mm.\n- The column section size is 600mm x 600mm.\n- The tensile strength design value \\( f_t \\) for C25 concrete is 1.27MPa.\n\nThe image also includes a diagram showing the cross-section of the pile cap, indicating the placement of the piles and the column within the cap. The diagram highlights the effective height \\( h_0 \\) and the dimensions of the pile and column sections."
