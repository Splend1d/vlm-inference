    "description": "The image shows a table with two columns labeled \"F.B.\" (Forward Bearing) and \"B.B.\" (Backward Bearing). The rows represent different lines in a closed compass traverse, labeled from \\(AB\\) to \\(EA\\). Each row contains the forward and backward bearings for each line. Here are the details:\n\n- **Line AB:**\n  - F.B.: 142\u00b030'\n  - B.B.: 322\u00b030'\n\n- **Line BC:**\n  - F.B.: 223\u00b015'\n  - B.B.: 44\u00b015'\n\n- **Line CD:**\n  - F.B.: 287\u00b000'\n  - B.B.: 107\u00b045'\n\n- **Line DE:**\n  - F.B.: 12\u00b045'\n  - B.B.: 193\u00b015'\n\n- **Line EA:**\n  - F.B.: 60\u00b000'\n  - B.B.: 239\u00b000'\n\nThese bearings are used to compute the interior angles and correct them for observational errors."
