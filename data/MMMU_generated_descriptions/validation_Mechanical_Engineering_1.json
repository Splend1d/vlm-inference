    "question": "From the A-A section in the following figure, select the correct section ().<image 1>",
    "options": "['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']",
    "id": "validation_Mechanical_Engineering_1",
    "description": "The image consists of two main parts: a three-dimensional object and four sectional views labeled A, B, C, and D.\n\n1. **Three-Dimensional Object**: The object appears to be a cylindrical shape with a rectangular extension on one side. There is a circular hole near the center of the cylinder, and another smaller circular feature on the rectangular extension.\n\n2. **Sectional Views**:\n   - **A**: This view shows a cross-section of the cylinder with the rectangular extension. The circular hole is visible, and the smaller circular feature on the rectangular extension is also shown.\n   - **B**: This view shows a similar cross-section but with a different orientation or angle, emphasizing the circular hole and the smaller circular feature.\n   - **C**: This view shows a cross-section that focuses on the circular hole and the smaller circular feature, but from a different angle compared to A and B.\n   - **D**: This view shows a cross-section that highlights the circular hole and the smaller circular feature, but from yet another angle.\n\nThe question asks to select the correct section (A, B, C, or D) based on the A-A section indicated in the three-dimensional object."
