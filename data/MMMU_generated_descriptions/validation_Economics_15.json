    "question": "The graph below shows the AD-AS diagram for Spain. Suppose that the economy experiences a positive aggregate supply shock denoted by the move from SRAS1 to SRAS2. Note that the new curve is shown in gray. <image 1> What happened to the structural unemployment in Spain (select one)?",

    "description": "The image is an AD-AS (Aggregate Demand-Aggregate Supply) diagram for Spain. The x-axis represents Real GDP, ranging from 0 to 1200, while the y-axis represents the Price Level, ranging from 0 to 1200. \n\nThere are several curves on the graph:\n1. **AD**: This is the Aggregate Demand curve, which is downward sloping. It starts at a Price Level of approximately 1100 and ends at a Real GDP of 1200.\n2. **SRAS1**: This is the initial Short-Run Aggregate Supply curve, which is upward sloping. It starts at a Price Level of approximately 500 and ends at a Real GDP of 700.\n3. **SRAS2**: This is the new Short-Run Aggregate Supply curve after a positive aggregate supply shock, which is also upward sloping but shifted to the right. It starts at a Price Level of approximately 400 and ends at a Real GDP of 700.\n4. **LRAS**: This is the Long-Run Aggregate Supply curve, which is vertical at a Real GDP of 700.\n\nThe graph shows that after the positive aggregate supply shock, the SRAS curve shifts from SRAS1 to SRAS2, indicating an increase in the quantity of goods and services supplied at each price level."
