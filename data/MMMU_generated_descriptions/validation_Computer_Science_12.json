    "description": "The image depicts a directed graph with eight nodes labeled from \\( a \\) to \\( h \\). Each node has two numbers associated with it, representing the discovery time stamp and the finishing time stamp in a Depth First Search (DFS). The numbers are formatted as \\( x/y \\), where \\( x \\) is the discovery time stamp and \\( y \\) is the finishing time stamp. Here are the details for each node:\n\n- Node \\( a \\): 13/14\n- Node \\( b \\): 11/16\n- Node \\( c \\): 1/10\n- Node \\( d \\): 8/9\n- Node \\( e \\): 12/15\n- Node \\( f \\): 3/4\n- Node \\( g \\): 5/7\n- Node \\( h \\): 2/6\n\nThe edges between the nodes are as follows:\n- \\( a \\) points to \\( b \\)\n- \\( b \\) points to \\( c \\)\n- \\( c \\) points to \\( d \\)\n- \\( d \\) points to \\( h \\)\n- \\( e \\) points to \\( a \\)\n- \\( e \\) points to \\( f \\)\n- \\( f \\) points to \\( g \\)\n- \\( g \\) points to \\( h \\)\n\nBased on these connections and the time stamps, the depth-first forest consists of the following sets of nodes:\n- \\( \\{a, b, e\\} \\)\n- \\( \\{f, g\\} \\)\n- \\( \\{c, d\\} \\)\n- \\( \\{h\\} \\)\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nB. {a, b, e} {f, g} {c, d} {h}"
