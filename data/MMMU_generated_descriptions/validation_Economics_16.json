    "question": "A recent study found that the demand and supply schedules for Frisbees are as follows:<image 1> Frisbee manufacturers persuade the government that Frisbee production improves scientists' understanding of aerodynamics and thus is important for national security. A concerned Congress votes to impose a price floor $2 above the equilibrium price. What is the new market price?",

    "description": "The image shows a table with three columns: Price per Frisbee, Quantity Demanded, and Quantity Supplied. The data in the table is as follows:\n\n- At a price of $11, the quantity demanded is 1 million Frisbees, and the quantity supplied is 15 million Frisbees.\n- At a price of $10, the quantity demanded is 2 million Frisbees, and the quantity supplied is 12 million Frisbees.\n- At a price of $9, the quantity demanded is 4 million Frisbees, and the quantity supplied is 9 million Frisbees.\n- At a price of $8, the quantity demanded is 6 million Frisbees, and the quantity supplied is 6 million Frisbees.\n- At a price of $7, the quantity demanded is 8 million Frisbees, and the quantity supplied is 3 million Frisbees.\n- At a price of $6, the quantity demanded is 10 million Frisbees, and the quantity supplied is 1 million Frisbees.\n\nFrom this data, we can see that the equilibrium price is $8, where the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied at 6 million Frisbees. If a price floor is imposed $2 above the equilibrium price, the new market price would be $8 + $2 = $10. Therefore, the correct answer is C. 10."
