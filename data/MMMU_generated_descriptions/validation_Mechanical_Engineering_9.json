    "description": "The image depicts a block diagram of a control system. The system consists of several components connected in a feedback loop. Here is a detailed description of the components and their connections:\n\n1. **Input Signal (R(s))**: This is the input signal to the system.\n2. **Summing Junction 1**: This junction combines the input signal R(s) with a negative feedback signal from the output C(s).\n3. **Gain Block (K1)**: This block represents a gain element with a gain value of K1.\n4. **Summing Junction 2**: This junction combines the output of the K1 block with a negative feedback signal from another part of the system.\n5. **Transfer Function Block**: This block represents a transfer function given by \\(\\frac{50}{s(s+1)}\\).\n6. **Derivative Block (K2s)**: This block represents a derivative element with a gain value of K2 multiplied by the Laplace variable s.\n7. **Output Signal (C(s))**: This is the output signal of the system.\n\nThe feedback loop includes the derivative block (K2s) which feeds back into the summing junction 2. The overall system is a closed-loop control system with two feedback paths: one direct feedback path from the output C(s) to the first summing junction, and another feedback path through the derivative block (K2s) to the second summing junction.\n\nThe goal is to find the values of K1 and K2 such that the closed-loop system has a peak time of 1 second and a settling time of 2 seconds for its step response."
