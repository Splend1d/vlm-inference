    "question": "NSAIDs such as aspirin can produce a type of allergic response in some patients. Which step, if blocked, is responsible for causing this drug allergy? <image 1>",

    "description": "The image depicts a simplified diagram of the biochemical pathway involved in the production of prostaglandins and leukotrienes from membrane phospholipids. Here is a detailed description:\n\n1. **Membrane Phospholipid**: The starting point of the pathway is membrane phospholipid, which is represented by a wavy line.\n2. **Arachidonic Acid**: Arachidonic acid is produced from membrane phospholipid through an enzymatic process (step 1).\n3. **Prostaglandins**: Prostaglandins are produced from arachidonic acid through another enzymatic process (step 2). This step is indicated by an orange arrow pointing to a symbol representing prostaglandins.\n4. **Leukotrienes**: Leukotrienes (LTC4 and LTD4) are also produced from arachidonic acid through a different enzymatic process (step 3). This step is indicated by a blue arrow pointing to symbols representing leukotrienes.\n5. **Blockage**: There is a red \"X\" symbol indicating a blockage or inhibition at step 4, which is after the production of leukotrienes.\n\nBased on this description, the step responsible for causing the drug allergy when blocked by NSAIDs such as aspirin is step 4, which involves the production of leukotrienes."
