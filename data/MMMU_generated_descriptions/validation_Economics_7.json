    "description": "The image is an AD-AS (Aggregate Demand-Aggregate Supply) diagram for Spain. The x-axis represents Real GDP in billions, ranging from 0 to 1100. The y-axis represents the Price Level, ranging from 0 to 1100. \n\nThere are three lines on the graph:\n1. **AD (Aggregate Demand)**: This line is downward sloping, starting at the top left corner and ending at the bottom right corner.\n2. **SRAS (Short-Run Aggregate Supply)**: This line is upward sloping, starting at the bottom left corner and ending at the top right corner.\n3. **LRAS (Long-Run Aggregate Supply)**: This line is vertical, intersecting the SRAS line at a point where the Real GDP is 500.\n\nThe intersection of the AD and SRAS lines determines the short-run equilibrium. At this point, the Real GDP is 500."
