    "description": "The image depicts a rectangular beam with dimensions of 200 mm in length and 30 mm in height. The beam has a circular hole located at its center, with a diameter of 15 mm. Additionally, there is a notch on one side of the beam, extending from the edge to a depth of 25 mm. The beam is subjected to two external forces, each of 65000 N, applied horizontally at opposite ends of the beam. The forces are indicated by arrows pointing towards the center of the beam."
