    "description": "The image depicts a manometer setup with three different fluids: water, mercury, and Meriam red oil. The manometer consists of two vertical tubes connected by a horizontal tube. The left tube contains water, the right tube contains mercury, and the middle section contains Meriam red oil. \n\n- The left tube has a water column of 35 cm.\n- The right tube has a mercury column of 18 cm.\n- The middle section contains Meriam red oil with a specific gravity (SG) of 0.827.\n- The height difference between the water and mercury columns is labeled as \"H.\"\n\nThe question states that the pressure difference between point B (at the bottom of the mercury column) and point A (at the bottom of the water column) is 97 kPa. The task is to determine the height H in centimeters."
