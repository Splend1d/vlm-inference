    "question": "An experiment is performed to measure the mass percent of $CaCO_3$(s) in eggshells. Five different samples of $CaCO_3$(s) of known mass react with an excess of 2.0 M $HCl$(aq) in identical sealed, rigid reaction vessels. The pressure of the gas produced is measured with a pressure gauge attached to the reaction vessel. Since the reaction is exothermic, the reaction system is cooled to its original temperature before the pressure is recorded. The experimental data are used to create the calibration line below. <image 1> The experiment is repeated with an eggshell sample, and the experimental data are recorded in the table below. <image 2> Which of the following modifications will increase the rate of the reaction the most? ",
    "options": "['Using 2.0 M $CH_3COOH$(aq) instead of 2.0 M $HCl$(aq) ', 'Cooling the $HCl$(aq) to a lower temperature than it was in the original experiment', 'Reducing the volume of the reaction vessel', 'Using eggshells that are more finely powdered than those used in the original experiment ']",

    "description": "The first image is a graph showing the relationship between the mass of calcium carbonate ($CaCO_3$) in grams and the pressure of gas produced in atmospheres (atm). The x-axis represents the mass of $CaCO_3$ in grams, ranging from 0.05 to 0.20 grams. The y-axis represents the pressure of gas produced in atmospheres, ranging from 0.02 to 0.10 atm. The graph shows a linear relationship with data points plotted at various masses of $CaCO_3$, and a straight line is drawn through these points to indicate the trend.\n\nThe second image is a table with three rows and two columns. The first column lists the properties of the eggshell sample and the pressures measured during the experiment. The second column provides the corresponding values for each property. The table includes the following information:\n- Mass of eggshell sample: 0.200 g\n- Pressure prior to reaction: 0.800 atm\n- Pressure at completion of reaction: 0.870 atm\n\nThese images are related to an experiment measuring the mass percent of $CaCO_3$ in eggshells by reacting them with hydrochloric acid ($HCl$) and measuring the pressure of the gas produced."
