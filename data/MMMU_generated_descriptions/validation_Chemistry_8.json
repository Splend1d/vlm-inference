    "description": "The image shows the chemical structure of a monosaccharide named Threose. The structure consists of four carbon atoms (C) arranged in a linear chain. The first carbon atom has an aldehyde group (-CHO) attached to it, indicating that this is an aldose sugar. The remaining carbon atoms have hydroxyl groups (-OH) attached to them, with the last carbon also having a hydrogen atom (H) attached. The presence of four carbon atoms and an aldehyde group classifies this monosaccharide as an aldotetrose."
