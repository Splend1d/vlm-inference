    "description": "The image depicts a water flow system with a pipe slanted at an angle of 30 degrees. The pipe has two points labeled (1) and (2), indicating different sections along the pipe. A mercury manometer is connected to the pipe, showing a height difference \\( h \\) of 12 cm between the mercury levels in the two arms of the manometer. The distance between the two points (1) and (2) along the pipe is given as 2 meters."
