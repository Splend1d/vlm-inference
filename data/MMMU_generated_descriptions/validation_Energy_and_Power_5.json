    "description": "The image depicts a cross-sectional view of a hollow steel sphere with a diameter of 14 inches. The sphere has a wall thickness of 0.16 inches. The sphere is partially submerged in water, with the water level indicated by a horizontal line near the bottom of the sphere. The radius of the sphere is labeled as R = 7 inches. The sphere is made of steel with a specific gravity (SG) of 7.85. The question asks how much weight must be added inside the sphere to make it neutrally buoyant."
