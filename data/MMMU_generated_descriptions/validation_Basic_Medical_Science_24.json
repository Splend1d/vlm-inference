    "description": "The image depicts an electrocardiogram (ECG) waveform with labeled components. The waveform includes several distinct segments:\n\n1. **P Wave**: This segment is a small upward deflection at the beginning of the waveform.\n2. **QRS Segment**: This segment consists of three parts:\n   - **Q Wave**: A downward deflection immediately after the P wave.\n   - **R Wave**: A sharp upward peak following the Q wave.\n   - **S Wave**: A downward deflection following the R wave.\n3. **T Wave**: This segment is a smooth upward deflection following the S wave.\n\nThese segments represent different phases of the cardiac cycle."
