    "description": "The image depicts a weighted undirected graph with six vertices labeled \\( a \\), \\( b \\), \\( c \\), \\( d \\), \\( e \\), and \\( f \\). The edges between these vertices have the following weights:\n\n- Edge \\( (a, b) \\) has a weight of 1.\n- Edge \\( (a, c) \\) has a weight of 6.\n- Edge \\( (b, c) \\) has a weight of 3.\n- Edge \\( (b, d) \\) has a weight of 4.\n- Edge \\( (c, e) \\) has a weight of 4.\n- Edge \\( (d, e) \\) has a weight of 3.\n- Edge \\( (d, f) \\) has a weight of 2.\n- Edge \\( (e, f) \\) has a weight of 5.\n- Edge \\( (f, a) \\) has a weight of 7.\n\nThe graph is fully connected, meaning there is a path between every pair of vertices."
