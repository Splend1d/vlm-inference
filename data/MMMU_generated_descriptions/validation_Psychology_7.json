    "question": "Which of the following regions is the main part of the neuron that contains neurotransmitter receptors (i.e. recieves incoming messages)? <image 1>",
    "options": "['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F']",
    "id": "validation_Psychology_7",
    "description": "The image depicts a neuron with various labeled parts. Here is a detailed description:\n\n- **A**: This is the dendrite, which is a branched extension of the neuron that receives signals from other neurons.\n- **B**: This is the cell body or soma, which contains the nucleus and other organelles necessary for the neuron's function.\n- **C**: This is the axon hillock, where the axon originates from the cell body.\n- **D**: This is the myelin sheath, which is a fatty layer that insulates the axon and speeds up the transmission of electrical signals.\n- **E**: This is the nodes of Ranvier, which are gaps in the myelin sheath along the axon.\n- **F**: This is the terminal boutons or synaptic terminals, which release neurotransmitters to communicate with other neurons or target cells.\n\nBased on this description, the main part of the neuron that contains neurotransmitter receptors (i.e., receives incoming messages) is the dendrite, labeled as **A**."
