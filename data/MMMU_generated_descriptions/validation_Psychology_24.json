    "description": "The image shows a cross-sectional view of a human brain. The brain is sliced in such a way that the internal structures are visible. The blue region is located at the lower part of the brainstem, specifically near the base of the brain where it connects to the spinal cord. This region is elongated and appears to be part of the brainstem itself."
